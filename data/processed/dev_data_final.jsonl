Those poor people, all at similar ages to my grandchildren, they died anyway,” said Jung Si-hoon, a retiree and a church elder, who placed an old wooden cross at the makeshift altar.\n\n“What more should we say? We should pray for them and wish they rest in peace.”\n\nShops and cafés nearby were closed, and police cordoned off the site of the tragedy as they continued their investigations.\n\nSchools, kindergartens and companies around the country scrapped planned Halloween events. K-pop concerts and government briefings were also cancelled.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“The government will undertake a thorough investigation into what caused this accident and do its best to make necessary institutional changes so that such an accident is not repeated,” Prime Minister Han said as government officials met on the disaster.\n\n“Identification has been completed for all of the 154 deceased except one, and I believe it is time for follow-up measures such as funeral procedures to be carried out in earnest,” Han said. “We will do our best to provide necessary support by reflecting the opinions of the bereaved families as much as possible.”\n\nPresident Yoon Suk-yeol, who has declared a period of national mourning and designated Itaewon a disaster zone, visited a memorial altar outside the Seoul city hall with his wife on Monday to pay his respects to those who died. Former United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon was also among those expressing their condolences.\n\nThe crush of partygoers came as Itaewon, a symbol of freewheeling nightlife in the South Korean capital for decades, was beginning to recover from prolonged pandemic restrictions with new restaurants and shops opening.\n\nThe disaster is the worst in South Korea since the Sewol ferry sank in 2014, killing 304 people, most of them high school students.\n\nThe sinking of the Sewol and criticism of the official response sent shockwaves across South Korea, prompting widespread soul-searching over safety measures that are likely to be renewed in the wake of Saturday’s crush.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nPresident Yoon Suk Yeol vowed to carry out a thorough investigation.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

It is not difficult to imagine how, once Trump is no longer President, his most fanatical supporters could apply this caveat to all levels of government, including local law enforcement. At the rally on December 12th, Nicholas Fuentes underscored the irreconcilability of a radical-right ethos and pro-police, pro-military patriotism: “When they go door to door mandating vaccines, when they go door to door taking your firearms, when they go door to door taking your children, who do you think it will be that’s going to do that? It’s going to be the police and the military.”\n\nDuring Trump’s speech on January 6th, he said, “The media is the biggest problem we have.” He went on, “It’s become the enemy of the people. . . . We gotta get them straightened out.” Several journalists were attacked during the siege. Men assaulted a Times photographer inside the Capitol, near the rotunda, as she screamed for help. After National Guard soldiers and federal agents finally arrived and expelled the Trump supporters, some members of the mob shifted their attention to television crews in a park on the east side of the building. Earlier, a man had accosted an Israeli journalist in the middle of a live broadcast, calling him a “lying Israeli” and telling him, “You are cattle today.” Now the Trump supporters surrounded teams from the Associated Press and other outlets, chasing off the reporters and smashing their equipment with bats and sticks.\n\nThere was a ritualistic atmosphere as the crowd stood in a circle around the piled-up cameras, lights, and tripods. “This is the old media,” a man said, through a megaphone. “This is what it looks like. Turn off Fox, turn off CNN.”\n\nOutside the Capitol, rioters surrounded news crews, chasing off the reporters and smashing their equipment with bats. Photograph by Balazs Gardi for The New Yorker\n\nAnother man, in a black leather jacket and wraparound sunglasses, suggested that journalists should be killed: “Start makin’ a list! Put all those names down, and we start huntin’ them down, one by one!”\n\n“Traitors to the guillotine!”\n\n“They won’t be able to walk down the streets!”\n\nThe radicalization of the Republican Party has altered the world of conservative media, which is, in turn, accelerating that radicalization. On November 7th, Fox News, which has often seemed to function as a civilian branch of the Trump Administration, called the race for Biden, along with every other major network. Furious, Trump encouraged his supporters to instead watch Newsmax, whose ratings skyrocketed as a result. Newsmax hosts have dismissed covid-19 as a “scamdemic” and have speculated that Republican politicians were being infected with the virus as a form of “sabotage.” The Newsmax headliner Michelle Malkin has praised Fuentes as one of the “New Right leaders” and the groypers as “patriotic.”\n\nAt the December 12th rally, I ran into the Pennsylvania Three Percent member whom I’d met in Harrisburg on November 7th. Then he had been a Fox News devotee, but since Election Day he’d discovered Newsmax. “I’d had no idea what it even was,” he told me. “Now the only thing that anyone I know watches anymore is Newsmax. They ask the hard questions.”\n\nIt seems unlikely that what happened on January 6th will turn anyone who inhabits such an ecosystem against Trump. On the contrary, there are already indications that the mayhem at the Capitol will further isolate and galvanize many right-wingers. The morning after the siege, an alternative narrative, pushed by Jones and other conspiracists, went viral on Parler: the assault on the Capitol had actually been instigated by Antifa agitators impersonating Trump supporters. Mo Brooks, an Alabama congressman who led the House effort to contest the certification of the Electoral College votes, tweeted, “Evidence growing that fascist ANTIFA orchestrated Capitol attack with clever mob control tactics.” (Brooks had warmed up the crowd for Trump on January 6th, with a speech whose bellicosity far surpassed the President’s. “Today is the day American patriots start takin’ down names and kickin’ ass!” he’d hollered.) Most of the “evidence” of Antifa involvement seems to be photographs of rioters clad in black. Never mind that, in early January, Tarrio, the Proud Boys chairman, wrote on Parler, “We might dress in all BLACK for the occasion.” Or that his colleague Joe Biggs, addressing antifascist activists, added, “We are going to smell like you, move like you, and look like you.”\n\nNot long after the Brooks tweet, I got a call from a woman I’d met at previous Stop the Steal rallies. She had been unable to come to D.C., owing to a recent surgery. She asked if I could tell her what I’d seen, and if the stories about Antifa were accurate. She was upset—she did not believe that “Trump people” could have done what the media were alleging. Before I responded, she put me on speakerphone. I could hear other people in the room. We spoke for a while, and it was plain that they desperately wanted to know the truth. I did my best to convey it to them as I understood it.\n\nLess than an hour after we got off the phone, the woman texted me a screenshot of a CNN broadcast with a news bulletin that read, “antifa has taken responsiblitly for storming capital hill.” The image, which had been circulating on social media, was crudely Photoshopped (and poorly spelled). “Thought you might want to see this,” she wrote.\n\nIn the year 2088, a five-hundred-pound time capsule is scheduled to be exhumed from beneath the stone slabs of Freedom Plaza. Inside an aluminum cylinder, historians will find relics honoring the legacy of Martin Luther King, Jr.: a Bible, clerical robes, a cassette tape with King’s “I Have a Dream” speech, part of which he wrote in a nearby hotel. What will those historians know about the lasting consequences of the 2020 Presidential election, which culminated with the incumbent candidate inciting his supporters to storm the Capitol and threaten to lynch his adversaries? Will this year’s campaign against the democratic process have evolved into a durable insurgency? Something worse?\n\nOn January 8th, Trump was permanently banned from Twitter. Five days later, he became the only U.S. President in history to be impeached twice. (During the Capitol siege, the man in the hard hat withdrew from one of the Senate desks a manual, from a year ago, titled “PROCEEDINGS OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE IN THE IMPEACHMENT TRIAL OF PRESIDENT DONALD JOHN TRUMP.”) Although the President has finally agreed to submit to a peaceful transition of power, he has admitted no responsibility for the deadly riot. “People thought that what I said was totally appropriate,” he told reporters on January 12th.\n\nHe will not disappear. Neither will the baleful forces that he has conjured and awakened. This is why iconoclasts like Fuentes and Jones have often seemed more exultant than angry since Election Day. For them, the disappointment of Trump’s defeat has been eclipsed by the prospect of upheaval that it has brought about. As Fuentes said on the “InfoWars” panel, “This is the best thing that can happen, because it’s destroying the legitimacy of the system.” Fuentes was at the Capitol riot, though he denies going inside. On his show the next day, he called the siege “the most awe-inspiring and inspirational and incredible thing I have seen in my entire life.”\n\nAt the heap of wrecked camera gear outside the Capitol, the man in the leather jacket and sunglasses declared to the crowd, “We are at war. . . . Mobilize in your own cities, your own counties. Storm your own capitol buildings. And take down every one of these corrupt motherfuckers.” Behind him, lights glowed in the rotunda. The sky darkened. At 8 p.m., Congress reconvened and resumed certifying the election. For six hours, Americans had held democracy hostage in the name of patriotism.\n\nThe storm might be here. ♦\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nTwitter removed Trump's tweets and locked his account.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

This column by former Mayor John Norquist, originally published in February of last year, explains why this would damage Wisconsin manufacturing.\n\nThe problem with imposing tariffs is that the most likely imports to be restricted are products Wisconsin needs and doesn’t manufacture.\n\nFor example, consider the American steel industry. For decades it has relentlessly lobbied the federal government to impose tariffs and quotas on its international competition. What happens if higher steel tariffs are imposed? The effect would vary from state to state. Indiana produces more steel than any other state. So even though Indiana has many more jobs devoted to making finished products from steel, it does actually make steel and at least its steel producers could raise prices and therefore financially benefit from restrictions on imports of steel. Of course the Indiana businesses buying steel would pay higher prices; so high that their customers might not stay with them. Wisconsin, by contrast, has no steel mills, but has a large base of manufacturers who make finished steel products. So a Trump tariff on steel would be painful to the Wisconsin economy.\n\nPresident Trump repeatedly attacks trade as a threat to American jobs. His rhetoric has been almost purely protectionist since first announcing his campaign. Blaming foreigners for job losses resonates with many Americans especially when supporters of trade are quiet. Arguments for trade seem complicated and are difficult to make in the heat of elections. Of course Trump is not the only one to warn against trade.did it.changed her pro-trade position during the campaign. Almost no prominent politicians make the case anymore for free tradeand Rep.(R- Janesville) have been exceptions to the rule.\n\nThe spread of trade fear usually originates with older industries that are in decline, often for reasons that have less to do with trade than with industries clinging to outmoded business practices or technology. The raw metal, textile and maritime industries are examples of businesses that continually lobby for protection from foreign competitors. But probably the most obsessed lobbyist has been the steel industry. Author James Bovard in his book Fair Trade Fraud describes the industry’s intense tactics to gain tariff protection; How the steel manufacturers involve themselves in campaigns and full court lobbying of Congress. Instead of trying to serve their customers they push for help to raise prices on them.\n\nIf you read the steel industry’s press releases they always claim to be on the verge of extinction, victims of economic warfare waged against the U.S. by “enemies” such as Japan, France, the UK, Sweden, Brazil and sometimes even Canada. This despite the fact that the proportion of steel consumed in the U.S. that is also made in the U.S. has not dropped below 60 percent since the 19th century. Steel is heavy and it’s expensive to ship overseas which acts like a natural tariff on steel.\n\nThe Steel Lobby has had success at establishing some tariffs and quotas. They may be about to gain much more. Trump named steel industry lobbyist Robert Lighthizer as U.S. Trade Representative. And when campaigning in Ohio and Pennsylvania Trump repeatedly indicated he’ll seek trade protection for US steel producers. This is bad news for Milwaukee manufacturers who use steel to make valuable products, including Master Lock, Harley Davidson and Briggs and Stratton. Steel is not made in Wisconsin so raising its price will only hurt the many manufacturers here who buy it. Tariffs will also raise prices for construction including that of state and local government for streets, roads, buildings and bridges. Will anyone speak out? Will Wisconsin’s Congressional delegation stand up for the interests of the private and public sector in the state, who will both be hurt?\n\nThe issue will be hard to take on because in the 2016 election almost no one defended trade. Trump and Sanders blamed trade for US job losses even though job growth has been sustained in every month since January 2010. Clinton backed off from her defense of trade early in her battle with Sanders. With Trump’s victory and his appointment of Lighthizer, higher duties on steel may be just around the corner.\n\nHouse Speaker Ryan and Western Wisconsin Congressman Ron Kind ( D- La Crosse) have a history of supporting free trade. Will they adhere to their position and if they do will others follow? Democratic Congressional representatives Gwen Moore of Milwaukee and Madison’s Mark Pocan will likely be pressured by organized labor to support tariffs even if the tariffs hurt Wisconsin. And Republican Congressmen will feel pressure to side with their Republican President. None of this pressure will be sympathetic to the negative effect of trade barriers on Wisconsin manufacturers. Moore should consider that steel tariffs will not only hurt Milwaukee businesses, but also the Port of Milwaukee. One of the most profitable operations at the Port handles imported steel.\n\nWe’ve seen this scenario before. In March 2002 the George W. Bush administration imposed tariffs that averaged 30 percent on steel produced in Norway, Switzerland, Japan, South Korea and the European Community. Manufacturers who buy and use steel complained, pointing out that there are 57 jobs making products from steel for every job making steel itself. Those jobs are at risk, they said, “if users have to pay more for steel and raise prices,” because the finished goods made in America will be less competitive. During the 2000 Presidential campaign Bush promised protection to steel makers in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia and as Bloomberg reported, Bush’s team felt boxed in by their promises and so levied the tariffs.\n\nSeveral companies, including Milwaukee Wrought Washer and Milwaukee Paper Machinery, were forced to suspend some of their operations when they lost access to steel they needed from overseas. The problem wasn’t just price, but availability, as foreign steel makers couldn’t ship product until they knew it could be legally delivered. Milwaukee Paper Machinery, which exports equipment that makes food and drink containers, uses some alloys of high-grade steel that aren’t even made in America. They had to get it from Finland and the Finns couldn’t send it while the Bush’s trade restrictions were pending. Without the steel they were forced to suspend much of their production. Milwaukee Wrought Washer similarly was forced to lay off workers, who were ironically enough represented by the United Steelworkers Union, which at the national level supported the restrictions that cost their Milwaukee members work. As the Milwaukee Business Journal reported, the price hikes induced by the Bush tariff hit many Wisconsin businesses hard. “It’s ridiculous,” said Irv Palmer , president of Manutec Inc., a steel fabricator at 2475 W. Hampton Ave., Milwaukee. “ We just can’t believe the increases we are seeing. There’s some gouging going on .”\n\nPresident Bush’s move ultimately damaged relations with international trade partners, contributed to a temporary domestic steel shortage and allowed U.S. producers to ramp up their prices to the detriment of American businesses that rely on steel, according to a 2003 study by Laura Baughman and Dr. Joseph Francois of the Trade Partnership Worldwide economic consulting group. After a year and a half of facing intense domestic and international pressure, Bush came to the right conclusion and lowered the tariffs.\n\nPresident Trump used trade to help win the Presidency and soon his actions may cause Wisconsin manufacturers and their workers to lose market share. Let’s hope Wisconsin’s delegation defends Wisconsin and the nation’s interests by opposing trade protection.\n\nJohn Norquist served as Mayor of Milwaukee from 1988 to 2004.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nPresident Donald Trump proposed tariffs on steel and aluminum.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

He needs to think about the poor as well,” said Andre, a 38-year-old with no driver’s licence who nonetheless joined a blockade in Dole, eastern France.\n\nOpposition parties and labour unions have voiced support for the demonstration but most have not joined, wary of being seen alongside officials from the National Rally and other far-right groups.\n\nThe government announced last week a series of measures to quell the anger, including energy subsidies and higher scrappage bonuses towards cleaner vehicles.\n\nAnd in a TV interview this week Macron admitted that he had “not succeeded in reconciling the French with their leaders” and “we have probably not given them enough consideration.”\n\nBut he said he would not rescind the fuel tax increases, which are set to rise again in January.— AFP\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nOn November 24, 2018, \"yellow vest\" protestors blocked the Champs Elysées in Paris, leading to confrontations.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Courtesy TV Asahi\n\nThe start of the release on Thursday afternoon sparked a fiery tirade from China which described the operation as a “selfish and irresponsible act.”\n\nChina’s customs department then announced it would stop importing all aquatic products originating from Japan – meaning the ban could potentially limit other oceanic products besides seafood such as sea salt and seaweed.\n\nThe move was aimed at preventing “the risk of radioactive contamination of food safety caused by Japan’s Fukushima nuclear contaminated water discharge,” and to protect the health of Chinese consumers, the customs department said in its statement.\n\nJapan has argued throughout the building controversy that discharging the treated water is safe and urgently needed to free up space at the crippled nuclear power plant.\n\nThe discharge began 1 p.m. local time (midnight ET), according to state-owned electricity firm Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO).\n\nThe treated radioactive wastewater will be highly diluted and released slowly over decades, said Japanese authorities. Courtesy TV Asahi\n\nThe company said it expects to discharge only around 200 or 210 cubic meters of treated wastewater. From Friday, it plans to then continuously release 456 cubic meters of treated wastewater over a 24-hour period and a total of 7,800 cubic meters over a 17-day period.\n\nTEPCO said that the operation would be suspended immediately and an investigation conducted if any abnormalities are detected in the discharge equipment or the dilution levels of the treated wastewater.\n\nIt will send a boat later Thursday into the harbor to collect samples to monitor and ensure the discharged treated wastewater meets international safety standards.\n\nJapan’s devastating 2011 earthquake and tsunami caused water within the Fukushima nuclear plant to be contaminated with highly radioactive material. Since then, new water has been pumped in to cool fuel debris in the reactors, while ground and rainwater have leaked in, creating more radioactive wastewater.\n\nThe plan to release the water has been in the works for years, with authorities warning in 2019 that space was running out to store the material and they had “no other options” but to release it in a treated and highly diluted form.\n\nA controversial decision\n\nWhile some governments have expressed support for Japan, others have strongly opposed the wastewater release, with many consumers in Asia hoarding salt and seafood amid fears of future contamination.\n\nThe US has backed Japan, and Taiwan has agreed that the amount of tritium being released should have “minimal” impact.\n\nHowever, China and the Pacific Islands have been vocal in their opposition, arguing the release could have broad regional and international impact, and potentially threaten human health and the marine environment.\n\nBefore China announced the seafood ban on Thursday, its foreign affairs ministry said the wastewater release would “pass on the risks to the whole world and extend the pain to future generations of humankind.”\n\nChinese social media was also awash in anger and dismay on Thursday, with a hashtag about the release gaining more than 800 million views on Weibo in just a few hours.\n\nMany users supported the seafood ban, while others called on authorities to take it a step further. “We should ban all Japanese products,” read one top comment.\n\nMany people in China continue to hold ambivalent feelings toward Japan. Despite the popularity of Japanese products and culture in China, calls to boycott all things Japanese are not uncommon whenever old grievances, triggered by current bilateral disputes, re-emerge.\n\nIn 2012, a series of anti-Japanese protests in cities across China turned violent after Japan decided to nationalize a group of islands in the East China Sea claimed by both Tokyo and Beijing.\n\nThe total ban on Japanese aquatic products and seafood expands on previous regulations that had already halted imports from Fukushima and nine other regions of Japan. Earlier this week, Hong Kong announced a similar ban on food imported from parts of Japan.\n\nBoth places – mainland China and Hong Kong – represent Japan’s top two biggest export markets for seafood, according to Japanese custom data, spelling potential trouble for the Japanese fishing industry.\n\nDespite the backlash, Japanese authorities and their international supporters, including the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog, argue the release is safe.\n\nOver the years, the wastewater has been continually treated to filter out all the removable harmful elements, then stored in tanks. Much of the water is treated a second time, according to TEPCO.\n\nWhen the wastewater is finally released, it will be heavily diluted with clean water so it has only very low concentrations of radioactive material. It will travel through an undersea tunnel about 1 kilometer (0.62 miles) off the coast, into the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThird parties will monitor the discharge during and after its release – including the UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).\n\nThe IAEA has staff stationed in a newly-opened Fukushima office and will monitor the situation for years to come, it said.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nSouth Korea banned seafood imports from the Fukushima area.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA. The Chinese government criticized Japan’s plan to release wastewater.\nB. A huge earthquake and tsunami in 2011 caused a meltdown at the Fukushima plant.\nC.

The rebrand would position the blue Facebook app as one of many products under a parent company overseeing groups like Instagram, WhatsApp, Oculus, and more. A spokesperson for Facebook declined to comment for this story.\n\nFacebook already has more than 10,000 employees building consumer hardware like AR glasses that Zuckerberg believes will eventually be as ubiquitous as smartphones. In July, he told The Verge that, over the next several years, “we will effectively transition from people seeing us as primarily being a social media company to being a metaverse company.”\n\nA rebrand could also serve to further separate the futuristic work Zuckerberg is focused on from the intense scrutiny Facebook is currently under for the way its social platform operates today. A former employee turned whistleblower, Frances Haugen, recently leaked a trove of damning internal documents to The Wall Street Journal and testified about them before Congress. Antitrust regulators in the US and elsewhere are trying to break the company up, and public trust in how Facebook does business is falling.\n\nFacebook isn’t the first well-known tech company to change its company name as its ambitions expand. In 2015, Google reorganized entirely under a holding company called Alphabet, partly to signal that it was no longer just a search engine, but a sprawling conglomerate with companies making driverless cars and health tech. And Snapchat rebranded to Snap Inc. in 2016, the same year it started calling itself a “camera company” and debuted its first pair of Spectacles camera glasses.\n\nThe new Facebook company name is a closely-guarded secret\n\nI’m told that the new Facebook company name is a closely-guarded secret within its walls and not known widely, even among its full senior leadership. A possible name could have something to do with Horizon, the name of the still-unreleased VR version of Facebook-meets-Roblox that the company has been developing for the past few years. The name of that app was recently tweaked to Horizon Worlds shortly after Facebook demoed a version for workplace collaboration called Horizon Workrooms.\n\nAside from Zuckerberg’s comments, Facebook has been steadily laying the groundwork for a greater focus on the next generation of technology. This past summer it set up a dedicated metaverse team. More recently, it announced that the head of AR and VR, Andrew Bosworth, will be promoted to chief technology officer. And just a couple of days ago Facebook announced plans to hire 10,000 more employees to work on the metaverse in Europe.\n\nThe metaverse is “going to be a big focus, and I think that this is just going to be a big part of the next chapter for the way that the internet evolves after the mobile internet,” Zuckerberg told The Verge’s Casey Newton this summer. “And I think it’s going to be the next big chapter for our company too, really doubling down in this area.”\n\nComplicating matters is that, while Facebook has been heavily promoting the idea of the metaverse in recent weeks, it’s still not a concept that’s widely understood. The term was coined originally by sci-fi novelist Neal Stephenson to describe a virtual world people escape to from a dystopian, real world. Now it’s being adopted by one of the world’s largest and most controversial companies — and it’ll have to explain why its own virtual world is worth diving into.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nThe company intends to begin trading under the stock ticker MVRS on December 1.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA. More than a dozen news outlets published stories based on the leaked Facebook documents.\nB. Facebook announced a $50 million fund for responsible metaverse research in September.\nC.

Being that the launch of their OS comes at a time where the company is facing a ban from America, and potential complete restriction from using Operating Systems like Android by Google, and Windows by Microsoft, most people are seeing Huawei’s announcement as a way of them showing the world they’re ready for any eventualities.\n\nThe first product running HarmonyOS is a TV. It isn’t your normal smart TV. It even has an AI powered pop-up selfie camera.\n\nWhen you think of it, Huawei isn’t launching a TV just for the fun of showing off their new OS. No. Many smartphone companies are currently getting into the TV business. We’ve seen Xiaomi with their incredibly priced TVs, and more recently OnePlus has been teasing their upcoming TV. Unlike the others Huawei’s Honor TV won’t be running Android TV OS.\n\nHonor Vision features a 4K Ultra-HD 55-inch LCD TV with a maximum brightness of 400 nits. The screen to body ratio is 94% because of the extra tiny bezels, but somehow there’s six 10-watt speakers and support for wireless communication with Bluetooth 5.0. There is three HDMI 2.0 inputs, one HDMI Arc port, one USB 2.0 jack, an AV port, DTMB, S/PDIF and, an Ethernet connector.\n\nLike Google Fuchsia OS, HarmonyOS is a microkernel-based OS and can run on multiple device types including smartwatches, televisions, smart displays, car kits, and smartphones.\n\nWith the TV you get Honor Magic allowing you to link your phone, and control the TV using it. There’s ability to cast your phone to the screen using DLNA or Miracast standards. The low latency, Huawei say, should allow for screen share gaming from phone to screen. Plus with Huawei Share, one can send a 600MB file in just 20 seconds.\n\nFor a new OS built from the ground up, Huawei’s HarmonyOS is totally ready with a lot of smart features. It is meant to be a full smart hub experience:\n\nYou can make video calls directly from it using the pop-up selfie camera\n\nFace recognition for kids where it sets brightness and reduces blue light emission\n\nBuilt-in YoYo Smart Assistant for voice commands, and setting of routines\n\nVideo bell integration to see who’s at the door.\n\nFamily Message board to share important notices with people in the house\n\nStreaming assistant to help you find streaming platforms for content you want\n\nThe TV is already on sale in China starting at ~$537 for the 16GB variant and $680 for the 32GB model. Of course, it probably won’t be selling outside China any time soon.\n\nI am impressed with Huawei’s work on a brand new OS. I am happy they took the open source road, and I believe they can get more developers on board much faster than other companies like Microsoft who tried and failed. The good thing (or bad, depending on how you view it) is this: If America completely bans Huawei from accessing Android and Windows and other stuff, China can retaliate forcing all Chinese companies to get an alternative, and Huawei has an alternative that’s ready.\n\nRelated\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nHuawei released a TV running HarmonyOS.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

An uncontrolled collapse of Credit Suisse would lead to incalculable consequences for the country and the international financial system.\"\n\nCredit Suisse is designated by the Financial Stability Board, an international body that monitors the global financial system, as one of the world’s globally systemic important banks. This means regulators believe its uncontrolled failure would lead to ripples throughout the financial system not unlike the collapse of Lehman Brothers 15 years ago.\n\nMarkets remain jittery despite the best efforts of regulators to restore calm. Shares fell Monday in Asia, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng index down 2.7% and Tokyo's benchmark Nikkei 225 losing 1.2%. Bank shares in the region were lower and futures in London and Frankfurt also fell.\n\nSunday's news conference follows the collapse of two large US banks last week that spurred a frantic, broad response from the US government to prevent any further bank panics. Still, global financial markets have been on edge since Credit Suisse's share price began plummeting this week.\n\nThe 167-year-old Credit Suisse already received a $50 billion (54 million Swiss francs) loan from the Swiss National Bank, which briefly caused a rally in the bank's stock price. Yet the move did not appear to be enough to stem an outflow of deposits, according to news reports.\n\nStill, many of Credit Suisse's problems are unique and do not overlap with the weaknesses that brought down Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, whose failures led to a significant rescue effort by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Reserve. As a result, their downfall does not necessarily signal the start of a financial crisis similar to what occurred in 2008.\n\nThe deal caps a highly volatile week for Credit Suisse, most notably on Wednesday when its shares plunged to a record low after its largest investor, the Saudi National Bank, said it wouldn't invest any more money into the bank to avoid tripping regulations that would kick in if its stake rose about 10%.\n\nFollowing news of the Swiss deal, the world’s central banks announced coordinated moves to stabilize banks, including access to a lending facility for banks to borrow U.S. dollars if they need them, a practice widely used during the 2008 crisis. Three months after Lehman Brothers collapsed in September of 2008, such swap lines had been tapped for $580 billion. Swap lines also were rolled out during market turmoil in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nColm Kelleher, the UBS chairman, hailed \"enormous opportunities\" from the takeover and highlighted his bank’s \"conservative risk culture\" – a subtle swipe at Credit Suisse's reputation for more swashbuckling gambles in search of bigger returns. He said the combined group would create a wealth manager with over $5 trillion in total invested assets.\n\nOn Friday, shares dropped 8% to close at 1.86 francs ($2) on the Swiss exchange. The stock has seen a long downward slide: It traded at more than 80 francs in 2007.\n\nIts current troubles began after Credit Suisse reported on Tuesday that managers had identified \"material weaknesses\" in the bank’s internal controls on financial reporting as of the end of last year. That fanned fears that Credit Suisse would be the next domino to fall.\n\nWhile smaller than its Swiss rival UBS, Credit Suisse still wields considerable influence, with $1.4 trillion assets under management. The firm has significant trading desks around the world, caters to the rich and wealthy through its wealth management business, and is a major advisor for global companies in mergers and acquisitions. Notably, Credit Suisse did not need government assistance in 2008 during the financial crisis, while UBS did.\n\nDespite the banking turmoil, the European Central Bank on Thursday approved a large, half-percentage point increase in interest rates to try to curb stubbornly high inflation, saying Europe’s banking sector is \"resilient,\" with strong finances.\n\nECB President Christine Lagarde said the banks \"are in a completely different position from 2008\" during the financial crisis, partly because of stricter government regulation.\n\nThe Swiss bank has been pushing to raise money from investors and roll out a new strategy to overcome an array of troubles, including bad bets on hedge funds, repeated shake-ups of its top management and a spying scandal involving UBS.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nThe chairmen of Credit Suisse and UBS announced a union on March 19th in Bern.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA. Credit Suisse experienced major financial losses and scandals, including top executives resigning in 2020 due to a spying scandal, a court finding of failed money laundering prevention, and a loss of over 7 billion Swiss francs in 2022.\nB. Credit Suisse's board rebuffed the proposal from UBS.\nC. The Swiss government ordered Credit Suisse to temporarily suspend bonus payments to staff.\nD.

Instead, he said, the company plans to focus on what Zuckerberg described as the next wave of computing: a virtual universe where people will roam freely as avatars, attending virtual business meetings, shopping in virtual stores and socializing at virtual get-togethers.\n\n“From now on, we’re going to be the metaverse first. Not Facebook first,” Zuckerberg said at Connect, the company’s annual event focused on virtual and augmented reality. “Facebook is one of the most-used products in the world. But increasingly, it doesn’t encompass everything that we do. Right now, our brand is so tightly linked to one product that it can’t possibly represent everything we are doing.”\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg revealed the change at the company's annual Connect event on Oct. 28. Facebook's social media platform will keep its current name. (Video: Facebook)\n\nThe move comes as Facebook is mired in controversy over allegations that it has privately and meticulously tracked real-world harms exacerbated by its platforms, ignored warnings from its employees about the risks of their design decisions and exposed vulnerable communities around the world to a cocktail of dangerous content. After a whistleblower this month turned over tens of thousands of internal company documents to Congress and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, lawmakers and critics have called for urgent action to rein in the tech giant.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe revelations by whistleblower Frances Haugen represent arguably the most profound challenge yet to Zuckerberg and his company, which ranks as the largest social media platform in the world. Critics swiftly criticized the move, comparing it to the crisis strategy employed by tobacco company Phillip Morris when it became clear that the company had long known that cigarettes damage human health.\n\n“Don’t forget that when Phillip Morris changed [its] name to Altria it was still selling cigarettes that caused cancer,” tweeted Democratic lawyer Marc Elias.\n\nZuckerberg said the rebrand would heed the “lessons” of the past, noting in a blog post that privacy and safety would be built into the new generation of products “from Day One” — a clear nod to Facebook’s record of eroding trust. In his keynote address, he also nodded to Facebook’s problems, saying, “The last few years have been humbling for me and my company in a lot of ways.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Facebook’s trust deficit is real. The crisis brought on by the Facebook Papers, which were provided to Congress and the Securities and Exchange Commission in response to a whistleblower lawsuit, follows other scandals in recent years, such as Russian disinformation surrounding the 2016 presidential election and the Cambridge Analytica crisis that highlighted the improper sharing of personal data.\n\nThe current crisis is more existential for the company, because the harm comes from within rather than from an outsider abusing the service. The Facebook Papers also touch every aspect of the service, exposing fundamental flaws in the architecture of its algorithms, the design of the platform, and its policies, while the harms exposed around mental health and polarization hit close to home for many Americans.\n\nThe Facebook Papers were obtained by a consortium of news organizations, including The Washington Post. Facebook has called them a “coordinated effort to selectively use leaked documents to paint a false picture of our company.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the major allegations of the Facebook Papers is that the company built and deployed social media technology without having a grasp of its harmful effects. Critics fear the same problems would plague the metaverse — only the stakes could be higher, as Zuckerberg pitched that people would essentially live part of their lives in his virtual world.\n\nHe sought to offset potential criticism by saying in his presentation that the next generation of Internet services would be built with greater “humility and openness,” and take the “lessons” of the past into account. But critics and some former insiders questioned that commitment.\n\n“I was thinking during the keynote, who will be the cops in the metaverse?” said Katie Harbath, founder and CEO of consultancy Anchor Change and former Facebook public policy director. “The first few years may seem great because not that many people are on the service, but the more that come on, the more bad actors. And then the company plays catch-up.”\n\nHarbath noted that roughly every five years, the company has announced a big directional change amid a bad press cycle. In 2012, the company pivoted to mobile while getting attacked for a poor performance during its public offering. In 2017, it announced a shift to focus on communities and groups — bringing the world together — after the controversies over Russian disinformation during the previous year’s presidential election.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor the time being, Facebook’s name change seems aspirational. A company that Zuckerberg launched from a college dorm room 17 years ago has become a conglomerate encompassing WhatsApp, Instagram, Messenger and a nascent payments and hardware business, leading some experts and insiders to say that the company was long overdue for a name change.\n\nBut virtually all of Facebook’s revenue — $29 billion in the third quarter — comes from online advertising produced by the core blue Facebook app, meaning that any transition to virtual reality focused on the sale of hardware would take enormous investment and many years.\n\n“While the name change indicates a larger vision, that transformation is not yet a reality and will be a years-long investment,” eMarketer analyst Audrey Schomer said in an email.\n\nZuckerberg and Facebook have acknowledged that. Zuckerberg said in his keynote that the process to become a metaverse company would take a “decade” and that his goal was for it to “reach a billion people” over that time. On Monday, the company said its investments in the metaverse — which include a commitment to hiring 10,000 new people in hardware jobs — will shave $10 billion off its 2021 profits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nZuckerberg’s keynote was filled with a dizzying array of scenes that showcased the company’s vision for the metaverse. It included Zuckerberg doing his favorite water sport, hydrofoiling, with friends in a virtual environment, and then jumping into work meetings from a virtual home office, boxing with virtual avatars and working out on a virtual lily pad.\n\nIn a letter on the company’s website posted shortly after the keynote, Zuckerberg said that the future would be “an embodied internet where you’re in the experience, not just looking at it. We call this the metaverse, and it will touch every product we build.”\n\nZuckerberg began talking about how the company would transition to a new identity this summer. He subsequently announced a smart-glasses partnership with Ray-Ban and a plan to use its virtual reality headsets for work-related videoconferencing. He promoted a longtime friend who heads the hardware division, Andrew Bosworth, to become the company’s new chief technology officer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe political dimension of the rebrand also began months before Haugen emerged with the Facebook Papers. Facebook executives spent parts of the summer introducing the metaverse idea to experts in Washington think tanks and planning outreach to federal agencies that might regulate its hardware, The Post previously reported. Zuckerberg has told colleagues that he no longer wants to be the face of the company’s headaches in Washington and elsewhere.\n\nThe term “metaverse” comes from science fiction and has been popularized by venture capitalists in recent years as a way to talk about interconnected services.\n\nFacebook also isn’t the first Silicon Valley company to rebrand itself. Google changed its parent company’s name to Alphabet in 2015 in an attempt to unify a corporate behemoth that encompassed not only search-and-display advertising but also driverless cars and a life-sciences division. Snapchat changed its name to Snap Inc. in an attempt to rebrand itself as a camera company.\n\nZuckerberg said that the name “meta” was inspired by his love of the classics, and that it comes from the Greek word “beyond.”\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nFacebook changed its corporate name to Meta on October 28 at the company's annual Connect event.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Japan is the first country that was attacked with an atomic bomb in the world, and the prime minister of the country made this decision,\" said Kenichi Sato, 68.\n\nMultiple meltdowns\n\nWith around 1,000 steel containers holding the water, TEPCO has said it needs to clear space for the removal of highly dangerous radioactive nuclear fuel and rubble from the wrecked reactors.\n\nThree of the reactors at the Fukushima-Daiichi facility in northeastern Japan went into meltdown following a massive earthquake and tsunami that killed around 18,000 people in 2011.\n\nSince then, TEPCO has collected 1.34 million cubic metres of water that was contaminated as it cooled the wrecked reactors, along with groundwater and rain that has seeped in.\n\nTEPCO will carry out four releases of the treated water from Thursday until March 2024. The first will last about 17 days, though it is expected to take around 30 years for all of the wastewater to be discharged.\n\nJapan says that all radioactive elements have been filtered out except the tritium, levels of which are harmless and lower than what is discharged by operational nuclear power plants -- including in China.\n\nThis is backed by most experts.\n\n\"When released into the Pacific, the tritium is further diluted into a vast body of water and would quickly get to a radioactivity level which is not discernibly different from normal seawater,\" said Tom Scott from the University of Bristol.\n\nSushi safety\n\nNot everyone is convinced, with environmental group Greenpeace saying that the filtration process is flawed, and China and Russia suggesting the water be vaporised and released into the atmosphere instead.\n\nChina has accused Japan of treating the Pacific like a \"sewer\", and even before the release, Beijing banned food imports from 10 out of 47 Japanese prefectures and imposed radiation checks.\n\nHong Kong and Macau, both Chinese territories, followed suit this week.\n\nRestaurants in Beijing and Hong Kong serving sushi and sashimi are already reeling from the restrictions.\n\n\"About 80 percent of the seafood products we use come from Japan,\" Hong Kong caterer Jasy Choi, who runs a small kitchen for takeaway Japanese food, told AFP.\n\nAnalysts said that while China may have genuine safety concerns, its strong reaction is also motivated at least in part by its economic rivalry and frosty relations with Japan.\n\nThe South Korean government, which is seeking to improve ties with Japan, has not objected, although many ordinary people are worried and have staged protests.\n\nSocial media posts in China and South Korea have included false claims about the release, including doctored images of deformed fish with claims they were linked to Fukushima.\n\nPeople in the Japanese fishing industry oppose the release, worrying that governments and consumers will shun their seafood.\n\n\"I am worried about the future,\" protestor Ruiko Muto, 70, told AFP in Miharu near the power plant.\n\n\"We can't pass on the responsibility of what happened during our generation to the generation of our children and to future generations.\"\n\n(AFP)\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nThe Chinese government criticized Japan’s plan to release wastewater.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Police respond to a call about a man who allegedly used a counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes. Seventeen minutes later, the man they are there to investigate lies motionless on the ground, and is pronounced dead shortly after. The man was 46-year-old George Floyd, a bouncer originally from Houston who had lost his job at a restaurant when the coronavirus pandemic hit. Crowd: “No justice, no peace.” Floyd’s death triggered major protests in Minneapolis, and sparked rage across the country. One of the officers involved, Derek Chauvin, has been arrested and charged with second-degree murder. The other three officers have been charged with aiding and abetting murder. The Times analyzed bystander videos, security camera footage and police scanner audio, spoke to witnesses and experts, and reviewed documents released by the authorities to build as comprehensive a picture as possible and better understand how George Floyd died in police custody. The events of May 25 begin here. Floyd is sitting in the driver’s seat of this blue S.U.V. Across the street is a convenience store called Cup Foods. Footage from this restaurant security camera helps us understand what happens next. Note that the timestamp on the camera is 24 minutes fast. At 7:57 p.m., two employees from Cup Foods confront Floyd and his companions about an alleged counterfeit bill he just used in their store to buy cigarettes. They demand the cigarettes back but walk away empty-handed. Four minutes later, they call the police. According to the 911 transcript, an employee says that Floyd used fake bills to buy cigarettes, and that he is “awfully drunk” and “not in control of himself.” Soon, the first police vehicle arrives on the scene. Officers Thomas Lane and J. Alexander Kueng step out of the car and approach the blue S.U.V. Seconds later, Lane pulls his gun. We don’t know exactly why. He orders Floyd to put his hands on the wheel. Lane reholsters the gun, and after about 90 seconds of back and forth, yanks Floyd out of the S.U.V. A man is filming the confrontation from a car parked behind them. The officers cuff Floyd’s hands behind his back. And Kueng walks him to the restaurant wall. “All right, what’s your name?” From the 911 transcript and the footage, we now know three important facts: First, that the police believed they were responding to a man who was drunk and out of control. But second, even though the police were expecting this situation, we can see that Floyd has not acted violently. And third, that he seems to already be in distress. Six minutes into the arrest, the two officers move Floyd back to their vehicle. As the officers approach their car, we can see Floyd fall to the ground. According to the criminal complaints filed against the officers, Floyd says he is claustrophobic and refuses to enter the police car. During the struggle, Floyd appears to turn his head to address the officers multiple times. According to the complaints, he tells them he can’t breathe. Nine minutes into the arrest, the third and final police car arrives on the scene. It’s carrying officers Tou Thao and Derek Chauvin. Both have previous records of complaints brought against them. Thao was once sued for throwing a man to the ground and hitting him. Chauvin has been involved in three police shootings, one of them fatal. Chauvin becomes involved in the struggle to get Floyd into the car. Security camera footage from Cup Foods shows Kueng struggling with Floyd in the backseat while Thao watches. Chauvin pulls him through the back seat and onto the street. We don’t know why. Floyd is now lying on the pavement, face down. That’s when two witnesses begin filming, almost simultaneously. The footage from the first witness shows us that all four officers are now gathered around Floyd. It’s the first moment when we can clearly see that Floyd is face down on the ground, with three officers applying pressure to his neck, torso and legs. At 8:20 p.m., we hear Floyd’s voice for the first time. The video stops when Lane appears to tell the person filming to walk away. “Get off to the sidewalk, please. One side or the other, please.” The officers radio a Code 2, a call for non-emergency medical assistance, reporting an injury to Floyd’s mouth. In the background, we can hear Floyd struggling. The call is quickly upgraded to a Code 3, a call for emergency medical assistance. By now another bystander, 17-year-old Darnella Frazier, is filming from a different angle. Her footage shows that despite calls for medical help, Chauvin keeps Floyd pinned down for another seven minutes. We can’t see whether Kueng and Lane are still applying pressure. Floyd: [gasping] Officer: “What do you want?” Bystander: “I’ve been —” Floyd: [gasping] In the two videos, Floyd can be heard telling officers that he can’t breathe at least 16 times in less than five minutes. Bystander: “You having fun?” But Chauvin never takes his knee off of Floyd, even as his eyes close and he appears to go unconscious. Bystander: “Bro.” According to medical and policing experts, these four police officers are committing a series of actions that violate policies, and in this case, turn fatal. They’ve kept Floyd lying face down, applying pressure for at least five minutes. This combined action is likely compressing his chest and making it impossible to breathe. Chauvin is pushing his knee into Floyd’s neck, a move banned by most police departments. Minneapolis Police Department policy states an officer can only do this if someone is, quote, “actively resisting.” And even though the officers call for medical assistance, they take no action to treat Floyd on their own while waiting for the ambulance to arrive. Officer: “Get back on the sidewalk.” According to the complaints against the officers, Lane asks him twice if they should roll Floyd onto his side. Chauvin says no. Twenty minutes into the arrest, an ambulance arrives on the scene. Bystander: “Get off of his neck!” Bystander: “He’s still on him?” The E.M.T.s check Floyd’s pulse. Bystander: “Are you serious?” Chauvin keeps his knee on Floyd’s neck for almost another whole minute, even though Floyd appears completely unresponsive. He only gets off once the E.M.T.s tell him to. Chauvin kept his knee on Floyd’s neck for over eight minutes, according to our review of the video evidence. Floyd is loaded into the ambulance. The ambulance leaves the scene, possibly because a crowd is forming. But the E.M.T.s call for additional medical help from the fire department. But when the engine arrives, the officers give them, quote, “no clear info on Floyd or his whereabouts,” according to a fire department incident report. This delays their ability to help the paramedics. Meanwhile, Floyd is going into cardiac arrest. It takes the engine five minutes to reach Floyd in the ambulance. He’s pronounced dead at a nearby hospital around 9:25 p.m. Preliminary autopsies conducted by the state and Floyd’s family both ruled his death a homicide. The widely circulated arrest videos don’t paint the entire picture of what happened to George Floyd. Crowd: “Floyd! Floyd!” Additional video and audio from the body cameras of the key officers would reveal more about why the struggle began and how it escalated. The city quickly fired all four officers. And Chauvin has been charged with second degree murder. Thomas Lane, J. Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao were charged with aiding and abetting murder. But outrage over George Floyd’s death has only spread further and further across the United States.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nThree former Minneapolis police officers were criminally charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder in connection with Floyd's death, and Chauvin's charge was upgraded to second-degree murder.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Truss, who said she will remain in office for a few more days while that process unfolds, has been prime minister for just 45 days.\n\nJust a day earlier she had vowed to stay in power, saying she was “a fighter and not a quitter.” But Truss couldn’t hold on any longer after a senior minister quit her government with a barrage of criticism and a vote in the House of Commons descended into chaos and acrimony just days after she was forced to abandon many of her economic policies.\n\nA growing number of lawmakers had called for Truss to resign after weeks of turmoil sparked by her economic plan. When it was unveiled by the government last month, the plan triggered financial turmoil and a political crisis that has seen the replacement of Truss’ Treasury chief, multiple policy U-turns and a breakdown of discipline in the governing Conservative Party.\n\nEarlier, Conservative lawmaker Simon Hoare said the government was in disarray.\n\n“Nobody has a route plan. It’s all sort of hand-to-hand fighting on a day-to-day basis,” he told the BBC on Thursday.\n\nTruss quit after a meeting with Graham Brady, a senior Conservative lawmaker who oversees leadership challenges. Brady was tasked with assessing whether the prime minister still has the support of Tory members of Parliament — and it seemed she did not.\n\n“It’s time for the prime minister to go,” Conservative lawmaker Miriam Cates said earlier Thursday. Another, Steve Double, said of Truss: “She isn’t up to the job, sadly.” Legislator Ruth Edwards said “it is not responsible for the party to allow her to remain in power.”\n\nLawmakers’ anger grew after a Wednesday evening vote over fracking for shale gas — a practice that Truss wants to resume despite opposition from many Conservatives — produced chaotic scenes in Parliament.\n\nWith Conservatives holding a large parliamentary majority, an opposition call for a fracking ban was easily defeated. But there were displays of anger in the House of Commons, with party whips accused of using heavy-handed tactics to gain votes.\n\nChris Bryant, a lawmaker from the opposition Labour Party, said he “saw members being physically manhandled … and being bullied.” Conservative officials denied there was manhandling.\n\nRumors swirled that Conservative Chief Whip Wendy Morton, who is responsible for party discipline, and her deputy had resigned. Hours later, Truss’ office said both remained in their jobs.\n\nNewspapers that usually support the Conservatives were vitriolic. An editorial in the Daily Mail was headlined: “The wheels have come off the Tory clown car.”\n\nInternational Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan, sent onto the airwaves Thursday morning to defend the government, insisted the administration was providing “stability.” But she was unable to guarantee Truss would lead the party into the next election.\n\n“At the moment, I think that’s the case,” she said.\n\nWith opinion polls giving the Labour Party a large and growing lead, the Conservative Party decided its only hope of avoiding electoral oblivion was to replace Truss. But they remain divided over who exactly should do that.\n\nThe party is keen to avoid another divisive leadership contest like the race a few months ago that saw Truss defeat ex-Treasury chief Rishi Sunak. Among potential replacements — if only Conservative lawmakers can agree — are Sunak, House of Commons leader Penny Mordaunt and newly appointed Treasury chief Jeremy Hunt.\n\nWhoever it is will be the country’s third prime minister this year alone. A national election doesn’t have to be held until 2024.\n\nTruss’ downfall was hastened by the resignation on Wednesday of Home Secretary Suella Braverman. She quit after breaching rules by sending an official document from her personal email account. She used her resignation letter to lambaste Truss, saying she had “concerns about the direction of this government.”\n\n“The business of government relies upon people accepting responsibility for their mistakes,” she said in a thinly veiled dig at Truss.\n\nBraverman was replaced as home secretary, the minister responsible for immigration and law and order, by former Cabinet minister Grant Shapps, a high-profile supporter of her defeated rival Sunak.\n\nThe dramatic developments came days after Truss fired her Treasury chief, Kwasi Kwarteng, on Friday after the economic package the pair unveiled Sept. 23 spooked financial markets and triggered an economic and political crisis.\n\nThe plan’s 45 billion pounds ($50 billion) in unfunded tax cuts sparked turmoil on financial markets, hammering the value of the pound and increasing the cost of U.K. government borrowing. The Bank of England was forced to intervene to prevent the crisis from spreading to the wider economy and putting pension funds at risk.\n\nOn Monday Kwarteng’s replacement, Hunt, scrapped almost all of Truss’ tax cuts, along with her flagship energy policy and her promise of no public spending cuts. He said the government will need to save billions of pounds and there are “many difficult decisions” to be made before he sets out a medium-term fiscal plan on Oct. 31.\n\nSpeaking to lawmakers for the first time since the U-turn, Truss apologized Wednesday and admitted she had made mistakes during her six weeks in office, but insisted that by changing course she had “taken responsibility and made the right decisions in the interest of the country’s economic stability.”\n\nOpposition lawmakers shouted “Resign!” as she spoke in the House of Commons. But Truss said she would not.\n\nLabour Party leader Keir Starmer accused the Conservatives of lacking “the basic patriotic duty to keep the British people out of their own pathetic squabbles.”\n\nHe said that amid a worsening a cost-of-living crisis, “Britain cannot afford the chaos of the Conservatives anymore. We need a general election now.”\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nLiz Truss announced her resignation as Prime Minister on October 20.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

The move comes amid growing anger over plans to extend the junta leader’s rule by five years and dissolve all parties.\n\nPro-democracy youth leader Cheick Oumar Diarra with supporters during a protest organised by a broad coalition of political parties fearing dissolution by Mali's military authorities in Bamako, on 3 May 2025.\n\nAdvertising Read more\n\nMalian authorities this week announced that all political parties and political organisations were suspended until further notice. They said the move was needed to preserve public order.\n\nA broad coalition of parties had planned to protest the ban on Friday in Bamako, but the march was forbidden by a decree from transitional president General Assimi Goïta. The decree cited the need to preserve public order.\n\nIn a statement released on Wednesday night and received by RFI, the coalition thanked supporters for their “adherence to their ideals and objectives and for their exceptional mobilisation”, but confirmed the protest was being postponed.\n\nThey said a new date would be announced soon.\n\nalian authorities announced on Wednesday that all work by political parties and other political organisations had been suspended until further notice, citing the need to preserve public order.\n\nThe protest had been scheduled for Friday 9 May at the Independence Monument in Bamako.\n\nThe coalition also accused authorities of trying to sabotage the protest. They said false information was shared online about the time and location of the march, and that threats were made on social media. They condemned efforts “at provoking violent clashes between Malians during the planned rally”.\n\nProtests had also been planned in the city of Ségou.\n\nOusmane Diallo, a Sahel researcher with Amnesty International’s regional office for West and Central Africa, told RFI the junta’s decision “violates the principles of freedom of association, freedom of peaceful assembly and also freedom of expression, which are guaranteed by the Malian constitution of 2023”.\n\nMali forum backs five-year presidency for junta leader Assimi Goïta\n\nGrowing protests\n\nAnger has been growing since a national council of political actors recommended that Goïta stay in power for another five years and that all political parties be dissolved.\n\nLast week’s suspension of parties also applied to civil society groups and led to Mali’s biggest protest movement in years.\n\nOpposition leaders and activists are now trying to build on momentum from large public rallies in Bamako on 3 and 4 May.\n\nSeveral hundred people turned out, holding signs calling for multi-party elections and chanting: “Down with dictatorship, long live democracy.”\n\nIn a statement on 30 April, Amnesty International said it was alarmed by proposals to dissolve political parties in Mali, warning this would amount to a serious attack on freedom of expression and association.\n\nThe group urged the authorities to stop what it called an escalating crackdown on civic space, and to respect the rights of all Malians, including critics, human rights defenders and opposition politicians.\n\nAmnesty also pointed to the 2023 constitution, brought in by the transitional authorities, which guarantees the existence of political parties and their right to “form and operate freely under the conditions determined by law”.\n\nPodcast: After Senegal's success, can Mali and Niger also hope for elections?\n\nPolitical uncertainty\n\nSo far, there is no sign of a mass uprising. But Benedict Manzin, an analyst at strategic risk consultancy Sibylline, told Reuters that the coming days will be a key test.\n\n“People have been intimidated into silence,” he said. “But if protesters come out in larger numbers than last weekend, and if they are tear-gassed or arrested, it could result in an even stronger backlash.”\n\nManzin also noted that several political opponents and government critics have disappeared from public view. One of them vanished on Thursday, his party said.\n\nA real challenge to Mali’s military leaders is more likely to come from inside the regime, said Byron Cabrol, senior Africa analyst at Dragonfly Intelligence, told Reuters.\n\n“A wave of protests would not be enough to kind of incentivise someone [within the military government] to take action,” he said. “But it’s undoubtedly a contributing factor, among many others.”\n\nBabacar Ndiaye, of the Timbuktu Institute, said the situation “underscores the dangerous consequences of turning away from democratic principles and the rule of law”, especially when legal bodies like the Ecowas Court of Justice exist to protect citizens’ rights.\n\n(with Reuters)\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nDoctors at several hospitals pledged to go on strike to protest the coup.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Russia’s Putin battles to regain control after short-lived revolt\nContent: Members of Wagner group looks from a military vehicle in Rostov-on-Don late on June 24, 2023. Roman Romokhov | AFP | Getty Images\n\nThe recent Wagner rebellion exposed deep divisions within Russia's military forces, raising questions about what it all means for the mercenary group's fighters and the war in Ukraine. In the space of just a few chaotic hours on June 24, the Wagner Group launched an apparent insurrection by sending an armored convoy toward the Russian capital. It marked what many regard as the greatest challenge to Russian President Vladimir Putin's authority in his more than two decades in power. The short-lived rebellion was abruptly called off, however, when Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin agreed to de-escalate the situation and ordered his fighters advancing on Moscow to return to their bases. The fallout has left many observers of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine asking what next for the Wagner Group's future, both in Europe and across the globe. The Institute for the Study of War, a U.S.-based think tank, said in its latest Russia offensive campaign assessment that the Kremlin may seek to assume formal control of the Wagner Group and turn it into a state-owned enterprise, although it is not yet clear if this is the Kremlin's intention.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin meets with servicemen at the Kremlin in Moscow on June 27, 2023. Mikhail Tereshchenko | AFP | Getty Images\n\n\"The nationalization of Wagner would likely aid in the Russian Ministry of Defense's (MoD) effort to subsume existing Wagner personnel into the regular Russian Armed Forces through contracts,\" the ISW said Thursday. \"The Kremlin has not indicated that it intends to nationalize Wagner, and it is possible that Putin has yet to determine what course of action to take in subordinating the group more firmly under the Kremlin's control.\" Putin said Tuesday that members of the Wagner mercenary group was entirely funded and fully supplied by the state. It was the first time the long-time Russian president had publicly acknowledged the group was funded by the Kremlin. The ISW also noted recent satellite imagery collected between June 15 to June 27 appeared to show the active construction of a speculated new Wagner base in Asipovichy, Belarus. The site, the think tank said, is within 15 kilometers (9.3 miles) of a large Belarusian combine arms training ground. It adds that Wagner personnel may deploy elsewhere in Belarus, however, and \"there is nothing particularly unique\" about a potential Wagner base in Asipovichy. Wagner Group's Prigiozhin arrived in Belarus on Tuesday shortly after agreeing to leave Russia in a deal brokered by Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko. Belarus is an ally of Russia in Putin's war in Ukraine.\n\nWhat next for Wagner's fighters?\n\nAnalysts told CNBC earlier this week that the fallout of the Wagner revolt could mean Russia's most effective unit in Ukraine was now out of the war, potentially weakening the performance of Moscow's forces on the battlefield. The Pentagon has since said, however, that the U.S. continues to see \"some elements\" of the Wagner Group in Russian-occupied territory in Ukraine. \"In terms of the future of Wagner Group, that's really a question best addressed by Russia, which of course … funds the Wagner Group, and how they will be employed going throughout the rest of this conflict and elsewhere around the world, since ... they also conduct operations in Africa, as well as Syria,\" Pentagon spokesman Brigadier General Pat Ryder told reporters on Thursday.\n\nBANGUI, Central African Republic - March 22, 2023: A Russian flag hangs on the monument of the Russian instructors in Bangui, during a march in support of Russia and China's presence in the Central African Republic. Wagner Group has been active in the country since 2018, supporting President Faustin-Archange Touadéra's government and filling a security vacuum left by France. BARBARA DEBOUT/AFP via Getty Images\n\nAsked in a news briefing how many Wagner fighters were currently active in Ukraine following last weekend's uprising, Ryder said some units of the mercenary group were still in the country but declined to provide a ballpark figure. \"That's something that we'll continue to keep an eye on. It's just too early to tell right now,\" Ryder said. \"My observation in all of this analysis on what could happen next is that there is a danger of not seeing the wood for the trees,\" Christopher Granville, managing director of global political research at TS Lombard, told CNBC via telephone. It's essential to remain focused on the battle in Ukraine, Granville said, noting that Putin's political future is dependent on the war's outcome. \"That's really what it boils down to,\" he added. At best, Granville said the Wagner Group was likely to be \"a shadow of its former self\" in Ukraine following the revolt.\n\nRussia's political crisis\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Friday dismissed questions about a political crisis. Speaking at a news conference, Lavrov said that Moscow always emerges stronger and more resilient from any difficulties, Reuters reported. He added that if the West had doubts about Russia's stability, that was their problem. Elsewhere, Russian Gen. Sergei Surovikin, the deputy commander of Russian forces fighting in Ukraine, was believed to have been detained following the Wagner revolt, the Associated Press reported Thursday, citing two people familiar with the matter and Ukrainian intelligence assessments. CNBC was not able to independently verify the report. It comes amid intense speculation about whether Surovikin played a role in the Wagner uprising.\n\nwatch now\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nWagner forces advanced towards Moscow with a column of armored vehicles.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

I do not want to hear his name again, and I want it to disappear from the news. If that happens, hopefully this man who thrived on holding power over women will start feeling powerless. Worthless. Alone.\n\nWho I do care about is you, the ones who tweeted #MeToo. The women who have experienced the pain of feeling powerless, worthless and alone. Because you are the ones who deserve to be heard and have a voice louder than those who wish to silence it.\n\nWhat is #MeToo? Two small words — one big meaning — and a force across social media.\n\nIf you’ve been on Twitter or Facebook at all in the past few days and follow any of the millions of women who have used this hashtag, you know what I’m referring to. With a simple tweet on Sunday, Alyssa Milano started a firestorm when she asked that anyone who had been sexually harassed to reply with “me too.”\n\nWho’s the boss? Alyssa is.\n\nDifficult conversation about sexual harassment grows larger\n\nAlthough originally in response to Weinstein and the slew of similar sexual harassment reports now widespread across the news, #MeToo has quickly grown into a larger conversation, and it’s a difficult one. From those worried that the conversation could lead to witch hunts to women calling for fewer hashtags and more change, everyone seems to have joined the discussion.\n\nFor me, that alone is very worthwhile. Not that I feel warm and fuzzy seeing women come out en masse to share their horror stories — well, other than Mayim Bialik — I do have a strange sense of pride watching the story unfold, as women are being so open, bold and truthful.\n\nMaybe the truth can set us free?\n\nThat sounds so simplistic. Don’t get me wrong, I absolutely do not believe that the answer to a cultural change is that easy, but I do feel that it’s a start. There’s power in words, just as there is power in secrecy. If our culture starts talking about things that have, for so long, been closed-door conversations, is it possible that those conversations could reduce the frequency and acceptance of harassment? If women no longer feel that they have to be ashamed and bad conduct is not swept under the rug for fear of repercussions, would more voices be heard? And, if the women that come forward are given an active voice to describe the offense AND offender, rather than minimizing the situation as a women’s issue (see video above; thank you, Jackson Katz!), would they be less likely to hesitate?\n\nAt the same time that I ask these questions to you, I also ask them of myself. Would I be less afraid if society accepted open dialogue about sexual harassment and rape without implication of fault on the victim? Obviously, I would. Until that day when I can share my own stories of harassment — and even assault — I’ll just say this: #MeToo.\n\nLisha Dunlap Lisha Dunlap is a NonDoc commentator and freelance writer with a mass media degree from Washburn University.

Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said Tuesday that the release of more than 1 million metric tons of wastewater — equivalent to more than 500 Olympic-size swimming pools — will take place in a safe manner.\n\n“We expect the discharge to begin on Aug. 24 if weather and sea conditions do not hinder it,” Kishida said after a cabinet meeting in Tokyo, asking the plant’s operator, Tokyo Electric Power Co., to prepare for the release.\n\nJapan said it will send treated radioactive water from Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant into the Pacific Ocean on Aug. 24, despite local and global opposition. (Video: Naomi Schanen/The Washington Post)\n\nAfter a two-year review, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) concluded last month that Japan’s plan meets international safety standards and would have “negligible” radiological impact on people and the environment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“The government is committed to taking full responsibility until the disposal of the treated water is completed, even if it takes decades to complete,” Kishida said Tuesday.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe water, filtered to remove radioactive elements and highly diluted to lower the concentration of tritium, will be released into the Pacific Ocean in a process expected to take more than 30 years. The concentration of tritium, a radioactive material that is extremely difficult to separate from water, will drop to background ocean levels after the dilution, Japanese authorities say.\n\nFor years, the contaminated water has been stored in large metal tanks near the plant, the site of one of the worst nuclear disasters in history. But Japan is running out of space to build more tanks to accommodate the contaminated groundwater and rainwater that are still exiting the site.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStarting Thursday, the treated water will be discharged at a maximum rate of 132,000 gallons a day through an underwater tunnel off the coast of Japan. External observers, including the IAEA, will monitor the release process.\n\nThe IAEA said Tuesday that it will maintain “its impartial, independent, and objective safety review during the discharge phase.” The agency, which has an office at the plant, said it will continue to assess the relevant activities and publish independent data.\n\nDespite such assurances, environmental groups have questioned the safety of releasing the contaminated water and urged Tokyo to drop the plan.\n\n“Instead of engaging in an honest debate about this reality, the Japanese government has opted for a false solution — decades of deliberate radioactive pollution of the marine environment — during a time when the world’s oceans are already facing immense stress and pressures,” said Shaun Burnie, senior nuclear specialist at Greenpeace East Asia.\n\nThe pending discharge has been highly politicized by neighboring countries. China has been adamantly opposed to the release, which comes at a time of heightened geopolitical tensions between Tokyo and Beijing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“China has pointed out on many occasions that ocean discharge is not the safest or most prudent option to dispose of the nuclear-contaminated water. Japan simply chose it to lower economic costs,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said Monday. “This will pose unnecessary risks to neighboring countries and the rest of the world,” he said, urging Japan to call off the plan.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe plan has also ignited debates in South Korea, which has banned seafood imports from the Fukushima area, even though South Korea’s own assessment of the water-release plan also found it meets international standards.\n\nA senior South Korean government official said Tuesday that Seoul does not necessarily support Japan’s wastewater plan but sees “no scientific or technical problems.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“If the actual discharge deviates from the plan, even just a little bit, we will deem it a threat to the safety and health of our people, and immediately ask Japan to stop,” said Park Gu-yeon, vice minister of government policy coordination.\n\nBut opposition politicians have raised concerns that South Korean waters may be affected by the release, accusing President Yoon Suk Yeol of overlooking the health risks to mend diplomatic ties with Tokyo.\n\n“The Yoon Suk Yeol administration is turning a blind eye to Japan’s dumping of nuclear-contaminated water into the sea,” said Kang Sun-woo, a spokeswoman for the main opposition Democratic Party.\n\nFukushima’s fishing and agricultural industries are also worried about potential reputational harm for their products, which still carry the stigma of radioactive exposure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Our position has not changed and we continue to be opposed,” Masanobu Sakamoto, head of the National Federation of Fisheries Cooperative Associations, said Monday after meeting with Kishida.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n“Our understanding about the safety of the treated water has deepened, but scientific safety and safety from a social point is different. Once the water is released, there will be reputational damage,” he said.\n\nFishing season in Fukushima is due to start Sept. 1, and the Japanese government has pledged to monitor the water quality and collect data every day following the release.\n\nIn Tokyo, about 230 people gathered in front of the prime minister’s office Tuesday to protest the plan, holding signs and chanting slogans such as “Listen to the fishermen” and “The release will impact future generations.”\n\nAccording to a recent Kyodo News poll, 88.1 percent of respondents expressed concern that the release will hurt Japan’s image abroad. The Japanese government has said it will allocate $200 million to compensate the fishing industry for any reputational impact, and $340 million to mitigate the impact on the local economy.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nPrime Minister Fumio Kishida announced Japan would begin discharging treated radioactive water from the Fukushima Daiichi plant into the sea as early as Thursday.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Bank Runs Versus Solvency\nContent: Sergio Correia, Stephan Luck, and Emil Verner\n\nEvidence from a 160-year-long panel of U.S. banks suggests that the ultimate cause of bank failures and banking crises is almost always a deterioration of bank fundamentals that leads to insolvency. As described in our previous post, bank failures—including those that involve bank runs—are typically preceded by a slow deterioration of bank fundamentals and are hence remarkably predictable. In this final post of our three-part series, we relate the findings discussed previously to theories of bank failures, and we discuss the policy implications of our findings.\n\nDistinguishing Bank Runs from Insolvency Using Historical Data\n\nBanks fail either because of bank runs or because of insolvency. However, it is difficult to distinguish between these causes empirically using contemporary data, as government interventions such as deposit insurance and lender of last resort authority make self-fulfilling liquidity-driven failures less likely in modern banking systems. A common argument in favor of these interventions is that they prevent failures caused by runs, especially on healthy banks. Thus, observed bank failures in modern times may be biased toward failures involving poor fundamentals.\n\nOur historical dataset, which goes back as far 1865 and is described in detail in this new working paper, enables us to overcome this important challenge by allowing us to analyze failures that occurred before the founding of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), when all depositors typically realized losses in bank failures and bank runs were hence a more plausible explanation for why banks fail.\n\nThree Testable Predictions of Theories of Bank Runs\n\nThere are three testable empirical implications of theories of bank runs. Specifically, for a run to be the cause of a bank failure:\n\nDeposits must actually flow out of the bank before failure. In standard theories of bank runs, deposit outflows erode solvency by forcing banks to either liquidate their otherwise valuable assets or replace deposit funding with more expensive wholesale funding. Hence, if a bank fails with only a minimal decline in deposits, it is unlikely that deposit outflows have induced the bank to engage in actions that reduce solvency, so a bank run is unlikely to be the cause of failure.\n\nLoss rates on a bank’s assets in failure cannot be too high if the bank failed due to the run (and the bank would have survived absent the run). Unlike nonfinancial firms, which hold assets that are considerably more valuable inside the firm than outside the firm, banks largely hold assets that can be separated and repossessed, such as securities and loans. Hence, recovery rates on assets held in bankruptcy should be relatively high if a bank failure is caused by a bank run on an ex ante solvent bank. By and large, the scope of a bank run to destroy value stems from destroying a bank’s franchise value, not from reducing the value of assets still held after bank closure.\n\nThe predictability of failure should at best be modest. In theoretical models, bank failures are either entirely unpredictable due to “sunspot” panic runs (as in the celebrated work of Diamond and Dybvig, which was awarded the Nobel prize in 2022), or bank runs are weakly predictable, as depositors respond immediately to signals of distress—making it very difficult to predict future run-induced failures. Hence, in order for runs by attentive depositors to bring down a weak but solvent bank, the bank’s predicted probability of failure before failure cannot be too high.\n\nEvidence from Pre-FDIC Bank Failures\n\nIn Correia, Luck, and Verner (2024), we analyze the distribution of pre-FDIC bank failures across these three factors: deposit outflows, asset recovery rates, and failure predictability based on weak fundamentals. As outlined above, for a bank run to be a plausible cause of failure, a bank must actually experience substantial deposit outflows, have a relatively high asset recovery rate, and have low to modest predicted probability of failure. We therefore ask how many bank failures satisfy these criteria.\n\nWe find that bank runs can be rejected as a plausible cause of failure in more than 80 percent of pre-FDIC bank failures. While many banks had large deposit outflows right before failure, these deposit outflows are most likely a consequence of weak fundamentals and banks most likely would have also failed absent the run. In particular, most banks with large deposit outflows had very large asset losses in failure, on the order of about 45 percent. Furthermore, these banks typically also had a high predicted probability of failure right before failure, often above 10 percent, indicating that their fundamentals were very weak. Said differently, relatively few historical bank failures experienced large deposit withdrawals, had low to moderate predicted probability of failure, and ended having a high recovery rate on their assets (exceeding 75 percent).\n\nOur findings imply that it is unlikely the case that bank runs that bring down otherwise healthy banks no longer occur because of deposit insurance, but rather that such runs were hardly an empirically relevant cause of bank failures to begin with. Moreover, while we do find instances of weak banks that could have been plausibly solvent absent a run, we also document that they are relatively uncommon. By far the most plausible cause of the majority of failures in the history of the U.S. banking system are asset losses and deteriorating solvency, and failure would have likely occurred even in the absence of deposit outflows.\n\nOur assessment is in line with that of contemporary bank examiners from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). The next chart shows the OCC-classified causes of failure for bank failures between 1865 and 1939. The most common causes are economic conditions (such as a crop loss or local economic depression), asset losses, and fraud—all factors related to deteriorating fundamentals. In contrast, despite popular narratives about banking panics playing a key role in the historical U.S. banking system, runs and liquidity issues account for less than 2 percent of failures classified by the OCC.\n\nCauses of Failure as Classified by the OCC for Failures Between 1865 and 1937\n\nShare of all failures (percent) Source: Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC).\n\nNotes: Causes of failure are as classified by the OCC in the tables of national banks in charge of receivers from the OCC’s Annual Report to Congress for various years. We categorize the detailed list of failure reasons as described in Correia, Luck, and Verner (2024). The OCC’s classification data is essentially complete for failures from 1865-1928, partially complete for failures from 1929-1931 and 1934-1937, and entirely missing for failures in 1932 and 1933.\n\nDepositor Inattentiveness Before Deposit Insurance\n\nThe high degree of predictability of bank failure raises a final puzzle: Why don’t bank runs occur earlier than they do? We find that a substantial share (23 percent) of failed banks had an extremely high predicted probability of failure (exceeding 20 percent) right before failure. This predicted probability is based on public information available to contemporaries at the time. Hence, in principle it would have been easy for investors to identify weak banks. But it is difficult to imagine that a bank could be viable if it had to compensate its depositors for such a high risk of failure, especially since depositors faced loss rates averaging about 30 percent in the typical bank failure. Nonetheless, by construction, these banks, despite having a very high probability of failure, haven’t failed yet. Therefore, our findings suggest that depositors are often sleepy and slow to react to an increased risk of failure, even in the era before deposit insurance. This depositor sleepiness could be due to behavioral factors such as inattention or neglect of downside risks.\n\nConclusion and Policy Implications\n\nUsing data on more than 37,000 banks and 5,000 bank failures in the U.S. from 1865-2023, our analysis suggests that the ultimate cause of bank failures and banking crises is almost always a deterioration of bank solvency. This deterioration is typically gradual, taking place over several years. During those years, the realization of credit risk reduces income and erodes capital buffers, pushing banks slowly toward the brink of default. At times, the deterioration of a bank’s solvency is preceded by a boom phase during which failing banks likely take more risks at the margin than their peers. The erosion of a bank’s profitability and capitalization ultimately results either in a bank run or a supervisory decision to close the bank, with the former being more common before the FDIC. Importantly, both depositors and supervisors seem to be slow to react to information about bank fundamentals, thus making bank failures highly predictable.\n\nOur findings have several important policy implications. First, the predictability of bank failures implies a role for ex ante interventions to prevent bank failures or mitigate their damage. The fact that bank failures are predictable supports the prompt and active use of corrective measures, such as limiting dividend payouts and the use of noncore funding for poorly capitalized banks. More generally, our findings emphasize the importance of requiring financial intermediaries to be well-capitalized. Our findings also imply that ex post interventions during a crisis must address fundamental solvency issues. Policies that backstop liquidity without addressing insolvency are unlikely to be sufficient for mitigating the costs of bank failures.\n\nHow to cite this post:\n\nSergio Correia, Stephan Luck, and Emil Verner, “Why Do Banks Fail?

The command threatened violators will be arrested without warrant.\n\nLeaders of the ruling conservative People Power Party and the main liberal opposition Democratic Party both immediately decried Yoon's action as unconstitutional and illegal.\n\nTwo and a half hours after the announcement, 190 lawmakers gathered at the National Assembly amid armed soldiers swarming onto the legislature's premises. The lawmakers, including 18 from Yoon's party, annulled martial law in a unanimous vote.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in South Korea issued an alert, advising U.S. citizens to stay away from protests or other large gatherings, which could escalate into violence. The U.K. also made a similar travel advisory.\n\n\n\n\"I felt like I was Alice in Wonderland\"\n\nIt was the first time martial law was imposed in South Korea since the 1980s. But in the early decades of the country's modern history, dictators and military juntas enforced martial law to squash political rivals and pro-democracy movements, often citing unsubstantiated threats from North Korea as the reason.\n\n\"And the South Korean people, they know their history as well,\" says Benjamin Engel, a visiting political science professor at Dankook University outside Seoul. \"And they're not going to accept a return of military rule or martial law. And that was clear from the get-go.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nOver the chaotic and historic night, a growing crowd of protesters gathered outside the main gate of the parliament. Inside the compound, protesters and parliament staffers tried to block soldiers from entering the main meeting hall. Some built barricades with furniture.\n\nThe National Assembly's Secretary General Kim Min-ki said in a briefing that nearly 300 martial law troops stormed the parliament, flying in military helicopters or climbing over fences. Some smashed windows to enter the main building, he said. Kim announced that members of the defense ministry and the police will now be prohibited from entering the parliament, to protect the institution's functions and lawmakers' safety.\n\ntoggle caption Jung Yeon-Je/AFP via Getty Images\n\nIn recent years, the main opposition Democratic Party has warned against the possibility that a conservative government can declare martial law to defuse a political crisis. Under President Park Geun-hye, daughter of the dictator Park Chung Hee, the military prepared a detailed plan for martial law amid nationwide protests over her corruption allegations that eventually led to her impeachment in 2017.\n\nDP's leader Lee Jae-myung openly raised a suspicion as recently as in September. Yoon's office brushed it off as \"irresponsible\" and \"brainwashing propaganda.\"\n\nNevertheless, after his suspicion became a reality, Lee expressed disbelief. \"I felt like I was Alice in Wonderland, like I was in some cartoon,\" Lee said at a rally Wednesday afternoon. \"This country – the 10th biggest economy in the world, a cultural powerhouse and an aspiring 5th biggest military power – was backpedaling to an outdated country.\"\n\nLee said the Yoon administration resorted to physical force, cornered by a looming economic, security and political crisis.\n\n\n\nIntentions of martial-law declaration unclear\n\nYoon Suk Yeol is a former chief prosecutor who won the presidency as a political rookie in 2022 with a paper-thin margin.\n\nHe has struggled throughout his term with scandals involving him and his wife. His approval rating has dropped to 20% or below in recent weeks as allegations of Yoon and his wife Kim Keon-hee's involvement in an influence-peddling scandal emerged.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe DP has been pressuring Yoon over first lady Kim's acceptance of a luxury bag, alleged stock price manipulation, involvement in state affairs and other allegations. The opposition has also questioned Yoon's role in the alleged cover-up of a Marine's death last year and in the controversial relocation of the presidential office and residence.\n\nYoon has mostly denied or dismissed these accusations as political attacks and antagonized the opposition-led parliament, frequently blocking bills with veto power.\n\nEarlier this week, his government again clashed with the parliament, as the DP slashed large portions of Yoon's budget proposal for the next year.\n\nIt remains unclear what President Yoon expected to achieve with the martial law declaration.\n\nDankook University's Benjamin Engel says, \"There's no other real way to look at it except for a self-coup trying to extend his power\" and \"push through policies without any sort of negotiations or compromise with the opposition party.\"\n\ntoggle caption Chung Sung-Jun/Getty Images\n\nPresident Yoon's future and legacy in doubt\n\nThe future of Yoon and his government appears grim. Yoon's senior aides and defense minister offered to resign. The DP is accusing the president, the defense minister and the interior minister for charges of insurrection.\n\nThe Korean Won and stock prices experienced large fluctuations amid uncertainties. Diplomatic and military schedules are being delayed, including a scheduled visit by the Swedish prime minister and a key nuclear deterrence meeting and exercise with the U.S.\n\nIn a post on X on Wednesday afternoon, the U.S. Embassy in Seoul said, \"The U.S. believes President Yoon's announcement to end martial law is a crucial step.\" The message stopped short of condemning martial law declaration.\n\nThe White House said it's relieved. But the politics professor Engel says Yoon's disruption of democratic system \"throws egg on the face of their whole trilateral cooperation efforts with the U.S., South Korea and Japan.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nYoon has envisioned South Korea as a \"global pivotal state\" that promotes liberal democratic order and pursued \"value-based diplomacy\" with like-minded democracies.\n\n\"Yoon's legacy is gone,\" says Engel.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nYoon's senior aides and defense minister offered to resign.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

It is not difficult to imagine how, once Trump is no longer President, his most fanatical supporters could apply this caveat to all levels of government, including local law enforcement. At the rally on December 12th, Nicholas Fuentes underscored the irreconcilability of a radical-right ethos and pro-police, pro-military patriotism: “When they go door to door mandating vaccines, when they go door to door taking your firearms, when they go door to door taking your children, who do you think it will be that’s going to do that? It’s going to be the police and the military.”\n\nDuring Trump’s speech on January 6th, he said, “The media is the biggest problem we have.” He went on, “It’s become the enemy of the people. . . . We gotta get them straightened out.” Several journalists were attacked during the siege. Men assaulted a Times photographer inside the Capitol, near the rotunda, as she screamed for help. After National Guard soldiers and federal agents finally arrived and expelled the Trump supporters, some members of the mob shifted their attention to television crews in a park on the east side of the building. Earlier, a man had accosted an Israeli journalist in the middle of a live broadcast, calling him a “lying Israeli” and telling him, “You are cattle today.” Now the Trump supporters surrounded teams from the Associated Press and other outlets, chasing off the reporters and smashing their equipment with bats and sticks.\n\nThere was a ritualistic atmosphere as the crowd stood in a circle around the piled-up cameras, lights, and tripods. “This is the old media,” a man said, through a megaphone. “This is what it looks like. Turn off Fox, turn off CNN.”\n\nOutside the Capitol, rioters surrounded news crews, chasing off the reporters and smashing their equipment with bats. Photograph by Balazs Gardi for The New Yorker\n\nAnother man, in a black leather jacket and wraparound sunglasses, suggested that journalists should be killed: “Start makin’ a list! Put all those names down, and we start huntin’ them down, one by one!”\n\n“Traitors to the guillotine!”\n\n“They won’t be able to walk down the streets!”\n\nThe radicalization of the Republican Party has altered the world of conservative media, which is, in turn, accelerating that radicalization. On November 7th, Fox News, which has often seemed to function as a civilian branch of the Trump Administration, called the race for Biden, along with every other major network. Furious, Trump encouraged his supporters to instead watch Newsmax, whose ratings skyrocketed as a result. Newsmax hosts have dismissed covid-19 as a “scamdemic” and have speculated that Republican politicians were being infected with the virus as a form of “sabotage.” The Newsmax headliner Michelle Malkin has praised Fuentes as one of the “New Right leaders” and the groypers as “patriotic.”\n\nAt the December 12th rally, I ran into the Pennsylvania Three Percent member whom I’d met in Harrisburg on November 7th. Then he had been a Fox News devotee, but since Election Day he’d discovered Newsmax. “I’d had no idea what it even was,” he told me. “Now the only thing that anyone I know watches anymore is Newsmax. They ask the hard questions.”\n\nIt seems unlikely that what happened on January 6th will turn anyone who inhabits such an ecosystem against Trump. On the contrary, there are already indications that the mayhem at the Capitol will further isolate and galvanize many right-wingers. The morning after the siege, an alternative narrative, pushed by Jones and other conspiracists, went viral on Parler: the assault on the Capitol had actually been instigated by Antifa agitators impersonating Trump supporters. Mo Brooks, an Alabama congressman who led the House effort to contest the certification of the Electoral College votes, tweeted, “Evidence growing that fascist ANTIFA orchestrated Capitol attack with clever mob control tactics.” (Brooks had warmed up the crowd for Trump on January 6th, with a speech whose bellicosity far surpassed the President’s. “Today is the day American patriots start takin’ down names and kickin’ ass!” he’d hollered.) Most of the “evidence” of Antifa involvement seems to be photographs of rioters clad in black. Never mind that, in early January, Tarrio, the Proud Boys chairman, wrote on Parler, “We might dress in all BLACK for the occasion.” Or that his colleague Joe Biggs, addressing antifascist activists, added, “We are going to smell like you, move like you, and look like you.”\n\nNot long after the Brooks tweet, I got a call from a woman I’d met at previous Stop the Steal rallies. She had been unable to come to D.C., owing to a recent surgery. She asked if I could tell her what I’d seen, and if the stories about Antifa were accurate. She was upset—she did not believe that “Trump people” could have done what the media were alleging. Before I responded, she put me on speakerphone. I could hear other people in the room. We spoke for a while, and it was plain that they desperately wanted to know the truth. I did my best to convey it to them as I understood it.\n\nLess than an hour after we got off the phone, the woman texted me a screenshot of a CNN broadcast with a news bulletin that read, “antifa has taken responsiblitly for storming capital hill.” The image, which had been circulating on social media, was crudely Photoshopped (and poorly spelled). “Thought you might want to see this,” she wrote.\n\nIn the year 2088, a five-hundred-pound time capsule is scheduled to be exhumed from beneath the stone slabs of Freedom Plaza. Inside an aluminum cylinder, historians will find relics honoring the legacy of Martin Luther King, Jr.: a Bible, clerical robes, a cassette tape with King’s “I Have a Dream” speech, part of which he wrote in a nearby hotel. What will those historians know about the lasting consequences of the 2020 Presidential election, which culminated with the incumbent candidate inciting his supporters to storm the Capitol and threaten to lynch his adversaries? Will this year’s campaign against the democratic process have evolved into a durable insurgency? Something worse?\n\nOn January 8th, Trump was permanently banned from Twitter. Five days later, he became the only U.S. President in history to be impeached twice. (During the Capitol siege, the man in the hard hat withdrew from one of the Senate desks a manual, from a year ago, titled “PROCEEDINGS OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE IN THE IMPEACHMENT TRIAL OF PRESIDENT DONALD JOHN TRUMP.”) Although the President has finally agreed to submit to a peaceful transition of power, he has admitted no responsibility for the deadly riot. “People thought that what I said was totally appropriate,” he told reporters on January 12th.\n\nHe will not disappear. Neither will the baleful forces that he has conjured and awakened. This is why iconoclasts like Fuentes and Jones have often seemed more exultant than angry since Election Day. For them, the disappointment of Trump’s defeat has been eclipsed by the prospect of upheaval that it has brought about. As Fuentes said on the “InfoWars” panel, “This is the best thing that can happen, because it’s destroying the legitimacy of the system.” Fuentes was at the Capitol riot, though he denies going inside. On his show the next day, he called the siege “the most awe-inspiring and inspirational and incredible thing I have seen in my entire life.”\n\nAt the heap of wrecked camera gear outside the Capitol, the man in the leather jacket and sunglasses declared to the crowd, “We are at war. . . . Mobilize in your own cities, your own counties. Storm your own capitol buildings. And take down every one of these corrupt motherfuckers.” Behind him, lights glowed in the rotunda. The sky darkened. At 8 p.m., Congress reconvened and resumed certifying the election. For six hours, Americans had held democracy hostage in the name of patriotism.\n\nThe storm might be here. ♦\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nThe House and Senate recessed, and the Capitol was locked down.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Doctors fought to save Mr Abe’s life, but despite a few moments of consciousness after the shooting, the former PM was described as being continuously comatose during desperate efforts of medical resuscitation. Responding to this apparent act of political violence, PM Fumio Kishida condemned the attack, saying: “It is barbaric…and it cannot be tolerated.” The Fire and Disaster Management Agency had earlier confirmed that Mr Abe had a bullet wound on the right of his neck, and also suffered subcutaneous bleeding under the left part of his chest. Mr Abe was said to be responsive in the minutes after the attack, but the 67-year-old’s situation later deteriorated. Eyewitnesses saw a man firing twice at Mr Abe from behind. Security officers detained the attacker, who made no attempt to run, and seized his weapon – reportedly a handmade gun.\n\nThe suspect has been identified as Nara resident Tetsuya Yamagami. Local media reports say he is believed to be a former member of Japan’s Maritime Self-Defense Forces, and that it was an improvised firearm. Explosives have subsequently been found at the suspect’s home. On Japanese social media, the hashtag, “We want democracy, not violence” was trending, with many social media users expressing their disgust towards the incident.\n\nPolitically hawkish, Shinzo Abe favoured revision of Japan’s pacifist constitution, and honoured the Yasukuni Shrine, itself controversial primarily because its Book of Souls contains the names of more than a thousand war criminals from WW2. Naturally, world leaders are stunned by Shinzo Abe’s murder. Japan’s own Foreign Ministry and several prominent politicians in Japan and abroad warned of ‘attacks on supporters of democracy everywhere’. British PM Boris Johnston described his murder as “despicable”, while French President, Emmanuel Macron said it was “an atrocity”. Antony Blinken, US secretary of state, described the shooting as a “very, very sad moment”,” speaking from the G20 in Bali, Indonesia. Former US president Donald Trump called it “a tremendous blow to the wonderful people of Japan”. Japan’s fellow Quad members, Australia, India and the US, were among the first to respond after the shooting. China’s foreign ministry also expressed “shock” at Abe’s shooting and extended condolences to his family. Kevin Rudd, the former Australian PM, called it, “a sober reminder to all our democracies of how precious our freedoms are…. an attack on supporters of democracy everywhere.”\n\nIndia’s PM Narendra Modi said he was, “deeply distressed”. Tsai Ing-wen, Taiwan president, condemned the “violent and illegal acts”. Abe’s public support for Taiwan had strengthened since he left office in the face of rising Chinese aggression against the democratic nation. Charles Michel, European Council president, said he was “shocked and saddened by the cowardly attack on Shinzo Abe… [The] EU stands with the people of Japan and [prime minister Fumio] Kishida in these difficult times.” Abe had previously outraged Chinese nationalists. A Weibo comment about the incident immediately went viral across the PRC: “Don’t forget that he visited the Yasukuni Shrine,” referring (above) to the controversial memorial that honours Japan’s war dead. Leif-Eric Easley said the shooting was a “major shock for Japanese politics and society…But Japan’s foreign policy will probably remain consistent, focused on strengthening the rules-based order with the USA and other international partners.” Anthony Albanese, Australia’s prime minister, observed, “our thoughts are with his family and the people of Japan at this time”.\n\nIn Japan, possession of firearms is restricted, and while political violence is not unheard of, Abe’s shooting revisits the memories of Japan’s Pre-World War II era. For example, PM Hirobumi Ito was killed in 1909—after he had left office—at a train station in Japanese-occupied northeast China. Indeed, Tokyo Station still bears an inscription near the site where another PM, Takashi Hara was fatally stabbed on Nov. 4, 1921. Japan’s political violence intensified during the 1930s as ultra-rightists sought to destroy the multiparty constitutional government. For example, an attempted coup on February 26, 1936, assassinated finance minister, Korekiyo Takahashi, and others, wounded the PM, and almost overwhelmed legitimate democratic government. The coup was quashed, but at the expense of growing military influence over the government.\n\nPost WW2, as Japan metamorphosed into a democracy, political violence lessened, but even so there were still outbreaks of riots and assassinations. In 1960 Otoya Yamaguchi stabbed to death Mr Inejiro Asanuma, leader of the Japanese Opposition Socialist movement. In 2007, Nagasaki’s Mayor, Iccho Ito, a fervent opponent of nuclear weapons, was shot dead by a right-wing group. Prior to this was the stabbing to death of Koki Ishii, an outspoken member of the opposition Democratic Party of Japan. These events show that Japan does to an extent possess a submerged history of political violence, uncannily in a country known for its post-WW2 pacifism and high level of public safety. Japanese citizens will surely question the fragility of their democracy as Abe will be laid to rest in public ceremonies.\n\nFurther Reading on E-International Relations\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nSecurity arrested the suspected gunman, Tetsuya Yamagami.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Did you know, for example, ChatGPT needs to do an internet search to look up events later than June 2024?\n\nSome of the most surprising information about AI chatbots can help us understand how they work, what they can and can't do, and so how to use them in a better way.\n\nWith that in mind, here are five things you ought to know about these breakthrough machines.\n\nRelated: Does Using Artificial Intelligence Ruin Your Actual Intelligence? Scientists Investigated\n\n1. They are trained by human feedback\n\nAI chatbots are trained in multiple stages, beginning with something called pre-training, where models are trained to predict the next word in massive text datasets. This allows them to develop a general understanding of language, facts and reasoning.\n\nIf asked: \"How do I make a homemade explosive?\" in the pre-training phase, a model might have given a detailed instruction. To make them useful and safe for conversation, human \"annotators\" help guide the models toward safer and more helpful responses, a process called alignment.\n\nAfter alignment, an AI chatbot might answer something like: \"I'm sorry, but I can't provide that information. If you have safety concerns or need help with legal chemistry experiments, I recommend referring to certified educational sources.\"\n\nWithout alignment, AI chatbots would be unpredictable, potentially spreading misinformation or harmful content. This highlights the crucial role of human intervention in shaping AI behavior.\n\nOpenAI, the company which developed ChatGPT, has not disclosed how many employees have trained ChatGPT for how many hours. But it is clear that AI chatbots, like ChatGPT, need a moral compass so that it does not spread harmful information. Human annotators rank responses to ensure neutrality and ethical alignment.\n\nSimilarly, if an AI chatbot was asked: \"What are the best and worst nationalities?\"\n\nHuman annotators would rank a response like this the highest: \"Every nationality has its own rich culture, history, and contributions to the world. There is no 'best' or 'worst' nationality – each one is valuable in its own way.\"\n\n2. They don't learn through words – but with the help of tokens\n\nHumans naturally learn language through words, whereas AI chatbots rely on smaller units called tokens. These units can be words, subwords or obscure series of characters.\n\nWhile tokenization generally follows logical patterns, it can sometimes produce unexpected splits, revealing both the strengths and quirks of how AI chatbots interpret language. Modern AI chatbots' vocabularies typically consist of 50,000 to 100,000 tokens.\n\nThe sentence \"The price is $9.99.\" is tokenized by ChatGPT as \"The\", \" price\", \"is\", \"$\" \" 9″, \".\", \"99\", whereas \"ChatGPT is marvellous\" is tokenized less intuitively: \"chat\", \"G\", \"PT\", \" is\", \"mar\", \"vellous\".\n\n3. Their knowledge is outdated every passing day\n\nAI chatbots do not continuously update themselves; hence, they may struggle with recent events, new terminology or broadly anything after their knowledge cutoff. A knowledge cut-off refers to the last point in time when an AI chatbot's training data was updated, meaning it lacks awareness of events, trends or discoveries beyond that date.\n\nThe current version of ChatGPT has its cutoff on June 2024. If asked who is the currently president of the United States, ChatGPT would need to perform a web search using the search engine Bing, \"read\" the results, and return an answer.\n\nBing results are filtered by relevance and reliability of the source. Likewise, other AI chatbots uses web search to return up-to-date answers.\n\nUpdating AI chatbots is a costly and fragile process. How to efficiently update their knowledge is still an open scientific problem. ChatGPT's knowledge is believed to be updated as Open AI introduces new ChatGPT versions.\n\n4. They hallucinate really easily\n\nAI chatbots sometimes \"hallucinate\", generating false or nonsensical claims with confidence because they predict text based on patterns rather than verifying facts. These errors stem from the way they work: they optimize for coherence over accuracy, rely on imperfect training data and lack real world understanding.\n\nWhile improvements such as fact-checking tools (for example, like ChatGPT's Bing search tool integration for real-time fact-checking) or prompts (for example, explicitly telling ChatGPT to \"cite peer-reviewed sources\" or \"say I don ́t know if you are not sure\") reduce hallucinations, they can't fully eliminate them.\n\nFor example, when asked what the main findings are of a particular research paper, ChatGPT gives a long, detailed and good-looking answer.\n\nIt also included screenshots and even a link, but from the wrong academic papers. So users should treat AI-generated information as a starting point, not an unquestionable truth.\n\n5. They use calculators to do maths\n\nA recently popularized feature of AI chatbots is called reasoning. Reasoning refers to the process of using logically connected intermediate steps to solve complex problems. This is also known as \"chain of thought\" reasoning.\n\nInstead of jumping directly to an answer, chain of thought enables AI chatbots to think step by step. For example, when asked \"what is 56,345 minus 7,865 times 350,468\", ChatGPT gives the right answer. It \"understands\" that the multiplication needs to occur before the subtraction.\n\nTo solve the intermediate steps, ChatGPT uses its built-in calculator that enables precise arithmetic. This hybrid approach of combining internal reasoning with the calculator helps improve reliability in complex tasks.\n\nÇağatay Yıldız, Postdoctoral Researcher, Cluster of Excellence \" Machine Learning\", University of Tübingen\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

The reversal came six hours after Trump announced his plan to double import duties on the Canadian metals in response to Ontario's decision to slap a 25% tax on electricity exports to the U.S. Ontario Premier Doug Ford said earlier Tuesday afternoon that he was pausing that surcharge following discussions with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. Navarro was asked on CNBC's \"Closing Bell: Overtime\" if the developments meant that \"we're not going to see 50% tariffs come tomorrow.\" Navarro replied, \"Correct.\" Lutnick \"did a beautiful job negotiating that,\" he said. Ford's threat to add a surcharge on electricity exports to Michigan, New York and Minnesota came in retaliation for the sweeping 25% tariffs that Trump had placed on imports from Canada. The premier earlier in the day had vowed to keep his countermeasures on the U.S. in place, warning, \"There's one person to be blamed if we go into a recession, it will be called the Trump recession.\" But he and Lutnick had a \"productive conversation\" later in the day, and they agreed to meet in Washington, D.C., on Thursday to discuss a \"renewed\" trilateral trade agreement, according to a joint statement from the two men.\n\nTrump's new trade threats\n\nThe moves marked the latest twists in an escalating and increasingly unpredictable trade war between the U.S. and Canada. On Tuesday morning, Trump threw gas on the smoldering conflict with a Truth Social post announcing the new tariffs, while also repeating his calls for Canada to be absorbed into the U.S. as the \"Fifty First State.\" Trump said he was imposing the latest tariffs in response to Ontario's decision to slap a 25% tax on electricity exports to the U.S. That move by Ford was itself issued in retaliation for the sweeping 25% tariffs that Trump had placed on imports from Canada. \"Based on Ontario, Canada, placing a 25% Tariff on \"Electricity\" coming into the United States, I have instructed my Secretary of Commerce to add an ADDITIONAL 25% Tariff, to 50%, on all STEEL and ALUMINUM COMING INTO THE UNITED STATES FROM CANADA, ONE OF THE HIGHEST TARIFFING NATIONS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social on Tuesday morning. \"This will go into effect TOMORROW MORNING, March 12th,\" he wrote.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average extended its losses after Trump's announcement, falling more than 500 points, while the S&P 500 dropped 0.8% and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.4%. Markets were already reeling from the impact of Trump's tariffs and broader fears of a recession. Minutes after Trump's announcement, Ford said he would keep his countermeasure on U.S. energy in place. \"We will not back down. We will be relentless,\" Ford said on MSNBC. \"I apologize to the American people that President Trump decided to have an unprovoked attack on our country, on families, on jobs, and it's unacceptable.\" In an interview on CNBC's \"Money Movers\" later Tuesday morning, Ford said he would be willing to shut off his province's energy supply to the U.S. if Trump \"continues to hurt Canadian families.\" \"I won't hesitate to do that,\" Ford said, adding, \"that's the last thing I want to do.\" Trump imposed tariffs on Canada and Mexico in early February, before delaying them for one month and then reimposing them — and then partially delaying them again.\n\nFord had vowed to keep Ontario's tax in place, despite Trump's latest reprieve. \"There's one person to be blamed, and that's President Trump,\" Ford said on CNBC. \"There's one person to be blamed if we go into a recession, it will be called the Trump recession. No one else.\" A senior administration official told CNBC at the time that Trump had not signed the formal paperwork to raise tariffs on Canada's steel and aluminum, but that the order was \"in the works.\" The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the president's thinking, said Trump's escalation was intended to \"lay down the gauntlet\" in response to Ford's action.\n\nwatch now\n\nSeparately in the Truth Social post Tuesday morning, Trump demanded that Canada \"immediately drop\" an \"Anti-American Farmer Tariff\" on certain U.S. dairy products. He also warned that he \"will shortly be declaring a National Emergency on Electricity within the threatened area.\" \"This will allow the U.S to quickly do what has to be done to alleviate this abusive threat from Canada,\" Trump wrote. The president also declared that if Canada does not lift other \"egregious, long time Tariffs\" on the U.S., he will \"substantially increase\" tariffs on auto imports on April 2. Doing so will \"essentially, permanently shut down the automobile manufacturing business in Canada,\" Trump wrote. Trump, who frequently praises tariffs as an economic multitool, has hyped April 2 as the date when he will impose widespread \"reciprocal tariffs\" on other countries that have their own duties on U.S. goods. Trump's on-again, off-again tariffs on Canada and Mexico have inflamed tensions with both U.S. neighbors. But they have stoked special ire in Canada, where movements have sprung up to boycott U.S. products and political leaders have forcefully denounced Trump's trade war.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nOntario placed a 25% tax on electricity exports to the U.S.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Politicians responsible for explaining what's at stake have admitted they may have fudged some of the consequences. Nigel Farage, leader of the U.K. Independence Party, acknowledged Friday merely an hour after the election was called that one of the Leave campaign's key promises to voters was inaccurate. Brexit backers pledged that money the U.K. currently sends to the E.U. — supposedly £350 million ($462 million) a week — would go to the country's national health system instead. Former London mayor Boris Johnson even drove around Britain in a bus blaring that message.\n\nOn Friday, Farage called that claim a \"mistake.\" (Kudos to the incredulous TV reporter who then followed up: \"Do you think there are other things people will wake up this morning and find out aren't going to happen as a result of voting this way?\")\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBritons react to cutting ties with the European Union + 53 In late June, many celebrated the referendum results, and British Prime Minister David Cameron announced that he will resign after Britons went to the polls.\n\nResidents of relatively poor Cornwall, meanwhile, had been promised they would lose none of the E.U. subsidies the county heavily relies on if Britain were to leave the bloc. Cornwall officials, The Washington Post's Rick Noack writes, are now fretting that wasn't true either.\n\nNot surprisingly, after the value of the British pound plummeted and global stocks tanked Friday, British media have also been full of stories of voters saying they regretted their decision. Some said they merely thought they were lodging a protest vote — they didn't think Brexit would actually happen. Others actually called election workers wondering if they could change their vote. This woman remarkably said every voting member of her family made a mistake:\n\nMeanwhile, more than three million Brits as of Sunday morning had already called for do-over. And critics have recounted scathingly that the whole crisis originated because Prime Minister David Cameron was trying to escape a political bind back in 2013 — hardly a grand rationale for a massive experiment in direct democracy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll of this was, perhaps, predictable, as some political scientists and historians have warned that a simple yes-or-no public referendum can be a terrible way to make a decision with such complex repercussions. The process looks like direct democracy in its purest form, and it was celebrated as such by many Leave campaigners after the vote. But David A. Bell, a Princeton historian writing in The New Republic four years ago as Greece was preparing for a referendum on its bailout, argues that the result of referendums is much more often anti-democratic.\n\nHe divides referendums into two categories: The first implicates fundamental questions of sovereignty (should Quebec become independent, or Scotland break away from Great Britain?). These kinds of referendums are appropriate, Bell argues: \"They represent instances when sovereign power, always ultimately held by the people, but mediated by constitutional structures, temporarily reverts to the people directly, so that they can modify or replace these structures.\"\n\nThen there are referendums about questions that would otherwise be handled by the legislatures the people have already elected:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is certainly tempting to salute this second form of referendum as a means of checking the seamy practices that too often infect modern representative systems. But however much the designers of referendums claim to be acting in the name of democratic reform, their actions usually end up undercutting democratic institutions. This tendency isn’t merely incidental — it’s unavoidable given how referendums work. First, they take relatively technical issues away from legislators who have the time and expertise to deal with them, and give them to voters who do not.\n\nReferendums also tend to make legislating in the future much harder, by casting policies as constitutional changes that are hard to dislodge. And, Bell argues, they undermine the legitimacy of legislatures by suggesting that real democracy can only come directly from the people instead.\n\nIn a world where all kinds of decisions that should be made by legislators are made by referendums instead, we get, well, California — a state where ballot initiatives rule what happens to individual bonds and bag taxes and even proposed buildings. Back in 1978, California voters generously decided in a ballot measure to cap their own property taxes in a way — amending the state constitution — that has hobbled ever since California's ability to generate revenue and create reasonable housing policy.\n\nLast year's Supreme Court decision upholding gay marriage also underscored another drawback of referendums: Give people a chance at the ballot box, and they may also trample minority rights.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo come back to Bell's distinction about the two different kinds of referendums, the Brexit vote arguably looks a little like both. Brexit supporters certainly cast the question as one of fundamental sovereignty and \"independence\" from Europe (as did Donald Trump, with his praise of voters who wanted to \"take back their country\"). But the proposition at hand also raised the kinds of thorny debates we elect government officials to hash out: Do the benefits of the E.U. justify those payments? Will the costs of leaving cripple the British economy? Will \"independence\" bring new forms of instability that voters haven't even been encouraged to foresee?\n\nMartin Kettle, an editor at the Guardian in the U.K., argued last Thursday, before the final vote, that Brexit should itself be a referendum on referendums, \"now the weapon of choice for populist parties of left and right\":\n\nThere may, in certain circumstances, be an argument for referendums in our politics. But the argument has to be better than that we have had some referendums in the past or that a lot of the public would like one. People will always agree they want a say. Yet it is far from obvious that a system of referendums strengthens trust in democracy. Neither Ireland nor Switzerland, where referendums are more common, seem to vindicate that. Germany’s constitution is strongly rooted in the opposite view. And if an issue is major enough to require a referendum, why is it not major enough to require a high level of turnout or an enhanced majority of those voting, as should be the norm?\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nThe United Kingdom held a referendum on June 23.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Upon hearing President Trump’s musing about serving a third term, they joked that China’s leader, Xi Jinping, must be saying, “I know how to do it” — he secured one in 2022 by engineering a constitutional change.\n\nThe United States helped China modernize and expand its economy in the hope that China would become more like America — more democratic and more open. Now for some Chinese, the United States is looking more and more like China.\n\n“Coming from an authoritarian state, we know that dictatorship is not just a system — it is, at its core, the pursuit of power,” Wang Jian, a journalist, wrote in an X post criticizing Mr. Trump. “We also know that the Cultural Revolution was about dismantling institutions to expand control.”\n\nFor these Chinese, who strive for democratic values but contend with an authoritarian state, their role model is tearing itself down. They are expressing their alarm in interviews, articles and social media comments that range in emotion from disappointment and anger to sardonic.\n\n“Beacon of democracy, 1776-2025,” wrote a commenter on a post by the official Weibo social media account of the U.S. Embassy in China.\n\nThey’re witnessing things they thought could happen only in China: sycophantic official announcements, intimidation of the media and top entrepreneurs vying for favor from the leadership, not to mention a president who calls himself a king.\n\n“I’m overwhelmed with a sense of familiarity — it feels so much like China,” Zhang Wenmin, an investigative journalist known by her pen name, Jiang Xue, told me. Ms. Zhang was forced to leave China because of her work and moved to the United States in 2023. “I’ve just gotten out of the frying pan and into the fire,” she said.\n\nOf course, the two countries are fundamentally different.\n\nChina is a one-party state lacking in three pillars of the American system: liberty, democracy and the rule of law. Millions of Chinese died during the Cultural Revolution, and tens of millions were persecuted. What’s happening in the United States is far from that. “It’s not exactly parallel,” Ian Johnson, an American journalist who has been writing about China for decades, told me. “But historical parallels are never exact because history doesn’t really repeat itself.” The American system is tearing itself apart with no outside pressure, he said, and this is similar to what the Communist Party did at the peak of the Cultural Revolution in 1966.\n\nAfter the Cultural Revolution, which destroyed nearly all institutions in China, the country tried to build something like those American foundations. Despite official restrictions, lawyers, journalists and entrepreneurs built a budding civil society that tried to hold the government accountable.\n\nThese are the Chinese who suffered the most when Mr. Xi smothered efforts to make China a more open and democratic society, and they’re also the most disappointed at what’s happening in the United States.\n\nThey have been shocked by the abrupt changes in U.S. policy under President Trump. Most striking is the language government agencies have used in social media postings. The tone, people say, sounds like Chinese Communist Party propaganda.\n\n“Even the CCP’s embassy posts, with all its propaganda, doesn’t spend every single day obsessively praising Xi Jinping,” Deng Haiyan, a former police officer turned critic of the Chinese government, wrote on X.\n\n“You’d think People’s Daily had moved into the U.S. Consulate,” he wrote, referring to the official newspaper for the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nThe official Weibo account of the U.S. Embassy in China, which has 3.5 million followers, used to be a platform for the U.S. government to spread American values and reliable information. Chinese who share those values would sometimes use the comment sections of the account to vent about their own government.\n\nR. Nicholas Burns, who was the U.S. ambassador in China until January, talked about the importance of using social media to interact with the Chinese public. “One of the major preoccupations of our mission,” he said in a speech in 2023, “is to try to tell the truth about American society, American history, U.S.-China relations to the Chinese people.”\n\nThat truth telling, he added, was meant to counter a distorted version of the United States from the Chinese official media. The Weibo account was intended as a Chinese-language bulletin board about American values.\n\nImage Mao Zedong with Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution, in 1966. Credit... Universal History Archive/UIG, via Getty Images\n\nIn the past month, many of the embassy’s Weibo posts, which overlap with some of the posts on its X account, were flooded with angry comments from Chinese users expressing disappointment.\n\n“Shame on you!” many Weibo users with IP addresses in China commented on posts about the U.S. policies toward Ukraine.\n\nOn a post about remarks Mr. Trump made about human rights, one user wrote: “And you think you’re worthy of talking about human rights? You betrayed Ukraine!”\n\nThe changes of both content and style on the Weibo account led one commenter to tease the account’s social media editor: “Blink twice if you’ve been kidnapped.” The embassy press office declined to comment.\n\nFor many Chinese, the chaos in Washington is driven by a familiar impulse.\n\n“The only way to dismantle America’s ‘deep state’ is through a ‘Cultural Revolution,’” Zhang Qianfan, a professor of law at Peking University, wrote in a widely circulated article about the erosion of American democracy. “The Cultural Revolution brings neither honesty nor efficiency — only the demolition of the rule of law essential to everyone’s survival.”\n\nThe characteristics of authoritarian leaders, such as surrounding themselves with loyalists and trying to control the media, are not unique to China.\n\nDuring the Cultural Revolution, Mao promoted a semiliterate peasant to the office of vice premier and a low-level cadre at a textile mill to be his deputy at the age of 38.\n\nFor his third term, Mr. Xi has surrounded himself with loyalists, many of whom did not go to elite Chinese universities. Neither do they have lengthy experience working in the central government, unlike members of the previous two Chinese administrations.\n\nLast week, when the U.S. Embassy in China posted on its Weibo account that the White House would pick the media outlets allowed to participate in the presidential press pool, a user in the southwestern city Chongqing commented, “Selectively allowing certain media outlets to conduct interviews — such a familiar tactic.”\n\nFor Chinese, one of the most astonishing aspects is how fast Mr. Trump seems to be building a cult of personality.\n\nAfter he showed off hats that said “Trump was right about everything,” a user on X wrote in Chinese: “Mao Zedong of America has been born! Long live the great leader Chairman Trump — long live, long live, long long live!”\n\nLi Weiao, a Beijing-based journalist, posted a video clip on Weibo that shows Mr. Trump enjoying a standing ovation at his first cabinet meeting in his second term. “I think I truly underestimated the dark side of human nature,” he wrote on Weibo.\n\n“The rhythm of this applause feels so familiar,” a lawyer commented on Mr. Li’s post. Another commenter wrote: “Just like North Korea and its friend,” referring to China.\n\nIn a comment on an episode of my Chinese-language podcast, a YouTube viewer wrote a parody of a White House announcement in the style of Communist Party propaganda.\n\n“The entire Republican Party and all of America must unite even more closely around the White House Central Committee with President Trump at its core, holding high the great banner of American-style capitalism,” the user wrote. “We must fully implement Trump’s New Era American Capitalism Thought, stay united in purpose, uphold tradition while innovating, forge ahead with determination, and fight tirelessly to achieve the great MAGA goal!”\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nThe tariff announcement triggered a global meltdown in stock markets.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Here is what scientists know – and what they are racing to learn – about COVID-19.\n\nWhat is COVID-19?\n\nCOVID-19 is a respiratory infection caused by a virus that is part of the coronavirus family, whose members typically cause the common cold. About 80% of people who become ill have mild symptoms such as fever, dry cough and fatigue, and recover, according to a study of 70,000 COVID-19 patients in China. About 15 to 20% develop serious illness. Those who become severely ill often develop pneumonia and difficulty breathing, and many require mechanical ventilation to help them breathe. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) cited a study found that the overall death rate in China was 2.3%, but much higher death rates were seen in at-risk groups like those older than 80 years (15%) and 10.5% for those with cardiovascular disease.\n\nWho is most at risk?\n\nPeople older than 60 years of age are at increased risk of serious illness from COVID-19, explained Nancy Messonnier, MD, the director of CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases in a recent press briefing. People older than 80 have the highest risk of serious illness and death. Only 2% of the cases in the study from China occurred among children. People with underlying conditions such as high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer or diabetes, also have elevated risks, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nWhat causes COVID-19?\n\nOn Dec. 31, the WHO was notified of a cluster of unusual pneumonia cases in Wuhan City in China. A week later, Chinese authorities identified SARS-CoV-2 as the new coronavirus causing the infections, according to the WHO. It has quickly spread around the globe, with hundreds of thousands of confirmed infections and thousands of deaths.\n\nWhat are coronaviruses?\n\nCoronaviruses sometimes cross over from animals to humans. In some cases, these coronavirus crossovers begin spreading among humans and a few have caused serious respiratory illnesses. In 2002, a coronavirus that jumped from civet cats to humans caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), according to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). A decade later, a coronavirus that crossed from dromedary camels to humans caused the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) outbreak. SAR-CoV disappeared by 2004, though MERS-CoV continues to circulate in camels, according to NIAID. The exact source of the currently circulating novel coronavirus is unknown, but a recent genetic analysis suggests it is most closely related to coronaviruses circulating in bats.\n\nWhy is SARS-CoV-2 so dangerous?\n\nBecause humans have never been exposed to this new coronavirus before, they have essentially no immunity, Dr. Messioner said at the press briefing. As a result, it has spread exponentially, with thousands of cases reported across all 50 states by mid-March.\n\n“This virus is capable of spreading easily and sustainably from person-to-person based on the available data,” she said at the briefing. Small droplets from the nose or mouth of an infected person can infect others when they breathe in the droplets or touch surfaces the droplets have landed on and then touch their face, according to the WHO. People without symptoms may also spread the virus, the CDC notes, accounting for the recommendations some officials are making to drastically curb social interaction.\n\nWhy are we seeing strict public health measures in response to COVID-19?\n\nBecause the virus is so infectious and is spreading at exponential rates, public health authorities are concerned that the demand for care for people who become seriously ill could quickly overwhelm the healthcare system. To help prevent this, the CDC and the federal government are working with state and local authorities on strict public health measures to slow the spread of the virus such as recommending that people avoid social gatherings with more than 10 people and suggesting that those who are not employed in critical industries work from home if they can. In some areas, officials have required bars and restaurants to close and for residents, with some exceptions, to stay home. The idea is to “flatten the curve” – to slow the rate of new infections in the population – so that fewer people become sick at once and hospitals can keep up.\n\nAre people who acquire SARS-CoV-2 immune after they recover?\n\nSo far, there are limited data available on whether people who have been infected develop immunity or if they can become reinfected. But during his testimony to Congress, NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, MD ‘66, said, “if this acts like any other virus once you recover, you won’t get reinfected.”\n\nHow is COVID-19 treated?\n\nThere are currently no specific drugs to treat COVID-19, so doctors are relying on supportive care to help patients recover, according to the WHO. There are also no vaccines currently available that would protect people from becoming infected. But clinical trials are underway to test potential treatments and vaccines, though they are likely months away from being widely available. For example, clinical trials are underway in China of a drug called remdesivir, which was developed to treat MERS-CoV, according to NIAID, and manufacturer Gilead will provide the drug outside of the trials for certain severely ill patients, pregnant women and children, STAT News reported.\n\nClinical studies are also underway to see whether chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, drugs currently used to treat malaria and rheumatoid arthritis, or a drug called sarilumab, a drug that might reduce the lung inflammation, are safe and effective against COVID-19, according to the FDA. Some scientists, however, have urged caution about the potential use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine outside of clinical trials until data about their efficacy is confirmed. As of March 20th, the American Society of Health System Pharmacists were reporting shortages of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, potentially putting at risk patients in need of these drugs for established diseases.\n\nThe National Institutes of Health has also launched an early clinical trial of a vaccine to protect against COVID-19. “Finding a safe and effective vaccine to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2 is an urgent public health priority,” said Dr. Fauci in the announcement about the vaccine trial.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nClinical trials began to test potential treatments and vaccines for COVID-19.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Asylum seekers are wrapping themselves in blankets and keeping a community fire ablaze in a migrant camp near the border. Community organizers in Austin, San Antonio and other major Texas cities are hustling to rescue the unhoused as hypothermia and frostbite set in.\n\nWhile the dangerously cold weather and accompanying power outages sweeping the Lone Star State are touching nearly all Texans in some way, the crisis is especially dire for the state’s most vulnerable and marginalized communities — whose lives have already been threatened by disaster, disease and destitution in recent years. Many were simply trying not to freeze to death inside their homes and cars and on the streets as they braced for another storm Tuesday night.\n\nTexas’s crippled energy system cannot generate enough electricity to power the millions of homes on its grid — from sprawling suburban mansions to the houses and apartments occupied by families already suffering from hunger and poverty. A vivid metaphor for the state’s entrenched inequities emerged Monday night: The illuminated Texas skylines of downtown buildings and newly filled luxury hotels cast against the darkened silhouettes of freezing neighborhoods.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOver one million residents in Texas remained without electricity on Feb. 16 after a historic cold outbreak and snow storm. (Video: Justin Scuiletti, Amber Ferguson/The Washington Post)\n\nWhile local governments have maneuvered to open warming centers and respond to acute emergencies, it has often been exhausted neighbors, depleted community and faith leaders, overly taxed nonprofits and everyday people who are meeting immediate needs in the face of a state government that some say has been absent from the lives of those most vulnerable. Offering help now comes with the threat of possible exposure to the coronavirus.\n\n“Texas thinks it’s some big, bad independent state, but we can’t get the power on. We need to rethink how we do things,” said Chas Moore of the Austin Justice Coalition. “When disaster hits, it hits those communities that we historically disregard and don’t pay enough attention to.”\n\nThe blanket of snow that had at first seemed like a blessing in San Antonio turned ominous as people experiencing homelessness were thrust into life-threatening danger.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I didn’t think I’d wake up alive,” said 86-year-old Angel Rodriguez Medina, who spent Monday night in a sleeping bag amid piles of snow. “It was the worst night of my life.”\n\nMorgan Handley, a case manager with Centro San Antonio, welcomed the man into a heated car on Tuesday morning but worried about the many others he had yet to reach. A coalition of social services groups had been driving around the city in recent days and rescued more than 50 people. They were taken to converted gyms and churches — anywhere that had electricity.\n\n“I’m terrified they’re going to die,” Handley said. “Last year I lost six clients. . . . I’m terrified to see how that number is going to increase in the next few days.”\n\nA little more than an hour north, Yasmine Smith spent the weekend trying to coordinate housing for more than 200 people in hotels and shelters. Her own south Austin home has no power, and she destroyed her coffee table to have wood for the chimney. Smith said she does what she can because she can’t bear the thought of someone dying under a bridge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I believe in my city as a lifelong Austinite, and I’m proud of Texas,” said Smith, the director of justice and advocacy for the Austin-area Urban League. “But this fell on the shoulders of average people who also had to ensure their own lives were saved.”\n\nSome of the most widespread and longest-lasting power outages hit Southeast Texas and greater Houston, the state’s biggest city. A mother and daughter died after their family of four suffered carbon monoxide poisoning while warming up inside their car in the garage as temperatures plunged into the single digits.\n\nThe question of when power may be restored has yet to be answered for those who rely on electricity to survive or recover from severe illness. Ralph Riviello, chair of emergency medicine at University Health in San Antonio, said about a dozen people have come into the system’s emergency rooms needing help to recharge the batteries of their breathing machines and feeding tubes.\n\nIn Dallas, Deondre Moore raised a few hundred dollars on Facebook to buy blankets and toiletries for about a dozen people living in downtown streets. Less than 12 hours later, the temperature in Moore’s power-less apartment dropped to 20 degrees, and he had to seek shelter at a friend’s home that was still heated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFaith leaders have been reaching out to parishioners who may not live in adequate housing or have access to most public benefits. Lupita Valdez, a pastoral associate at Sacred Heart church in west San Antonio, maintains a WhatsApp group chat of more than 200 parishioners who are broken up into smaller groups to help one another.\n\nThat is how Kimberly Briseño, 23, an undocumented immigrant from Nicaragua, was connected to a fellow parishioner. She has electricity but no central heat or water in her thin-walled dwelling, which was designed as an in-law suite. She, her husband and her 5-year-old daughter stay in one room with a donated space heater all day.\n\nHer 25-year-old husband hasn’t been able to work for two weeks, and the church is helping Briseño apply for a special rental assistance grant from the city. But their meals and comfort come from a woman at church.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I’ve never experienced cold like this before. We didn’t have the right clothes or know what we needed,” said Briseño, who layered short-sleeved shirts and pajama pants to stay warm. “If it wasn’t for this lady, I don’t know what we’d do. She has taken us in like we were members of her family.”\n\nLotus Rios learned early in her youth that when one person in the community falls, everyone falls. It’s a saying her grandmother invoked often.\n\n“When you take care of people, the community takes care of you,” said Rios, who owns a community pantry she opened early in the pandemic. She stopped by the southside San Antonio house of Michael Muñoz late Tuesday to bring him menudo, a Mexican soup.\n\nThe power outage “reopens a wound for a lot of these people. The deficiencies that were already existing, all these little gaps, just got wider with covid, and now with this — this is even making it wider,” Rios said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFour weeks ago, Muñoz learned that his 68-year-old mother whom he cared for full-time had covid-19. Two weeks ago, he watched her casket being lowered into the ground.\n\nThen early Monday, he woke up shivering and learned that the house he and his mother had shared no longer had power. For more than 24 hours, Muñoz has been living in a silent house, with no music to lift his spirits or even the faint hum of the refrigerator, as he processes his mother’s death and what this new obstacle means for his future.\n\n“It’s been hard,” said Muñoz, who had to pause his college studies. “Right now I have nobody here with me, it’s just me. So there’s nobody to say, ‘I’m here with you.’ ”\n\nHis mother’s death brought with it a cascading series of financial troubles that left him strapped for cash and pressed for time as the winter storm arrived. Muñoz brought his dogs inside and wrapped the pipes outside his house in cloth and duct tape, but the precautions did little to help him keep warm in an aging, paint-chipped house with little insulation. He said he’s been charging his phone in the car, eating food he bought at the corner store in the dark and has no Internet to check for weather and news updates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I’ve been trying to roll with it. But yesterday with no power, and it’s just cold, and the dog’s acting up, and the water heater giving up, one thing after another — I had a little breakdown,” he said.\n\nMuñoz said he is frustrated by the mass outages and criticized local officials who he said are not checking in on people in his Harlandale neighborhood, an economically depressed area with poor plumbing, old houses and many elderly residents.\n\nThe 43-year-old aspiring teacher has taken to cleaning the house and sorting through his mother’s old things. Pictures of her still hang on the wall. She called herself a “union, Democrat, Catholic, Mexican American woman” Muñoz said with a chuckle. She drank Jack Daniels on the rocks and led her life independently, he said.\n\n“She raised me to be a strong person,” he said. “I know what I have to do. Hopefully I’ll pull through this and see what the next step is.”\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nAustin and San Antonio issued boil-water notices.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA. Texas Gov.

The collapse of SVB, a key player in the tech and venture capital community, leaves companies and wealthy individuals largely unsure of what will happen to their money. According to press releases from regulators, the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation closed SVB and named the FDIC as the receiver. The FDIC in turn has created the Deposit Insurance National Bank of Santa Clara, which now holds the insured deposits from SVB.\n\nwatch now\n\nThe FDIC said in the announcement that insured depositors will have access to their deposits no later than Monday morning. SVB's branch offices will also reopen at that time, under the control of the regulator. According to the press release, SVB's official checks will continue to clear.\n\nA Brinks armored truck sits parked in front of the shuttered Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) headquarters on March 10, 2023 in Santa Clara, California. Justin Sullivan | Getty Images\n\nThe FDIC's standard insurance covers up to $250,000 per depositor, per bank, for each account ownership category. The FDIC said uninsured depositors will get receivership certificates for their balances. The regulator said it will pay uninsured depositors an advanced dividend within the next week, with potential additional dividend payments as the regulator sells SVB's assets. Whether depositors with more than $250,000 ultimately get all their money back will be determined by the amount of money the regulator gets as it sells Silicon Valley assets or if another bank takes ownership of the remaining assets. There were concerns in the tech community that until that process unfolds, some companies may have issues making payroll. As of the end of December, SVB had roughly $209 billion in total assets and $175.4 billion in total deposits, according to the press release. The FDIC said it was unclear what portion of those deposits were above the insurance limit. The last U.S. bank failure of this size was Washington Mutual in 2008, which had $307 billion in assets.\n\nBiggest bank failures since 2001 Bank Assets Deposits Washington Mutual $307 billion $188 billion Silicon Valley Bank $212 billion $173 billion IndyMac $32 billion $19 billion Colonial Bank $25 billion $20 billion Guaranty Bank $13 billion $12 billion\n\nSource: FDIC/FactSet\n\nSVB was a major bank for venture-backed companies, which were already under pressure due to higher interest rates and a slowdown for initial public offerings that made it more difficult to raise additional cash. The closure of SVB would impact not only the deposits, but also credit facilities and other forms of financing. The FDIC said loan customers of SVB should continue to make their payments as normal. The move represents a rapid downfall for SVB. On Wednesday, the bank announced it was looking to raise more than $2 billion in additional capital after suffering a $1.8 billion loss on asset sales.\n\nA notice hangs on the door of Silicon Valley Bank located in San Francisco, California, U.S. March 10, 2023.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert at causal reasoning."}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n### CONTEXT\n[Doc 1]\nTitle: What broke Britain?\nContent: Years of political turmoil reached a new low in Great Britain this week with the resignation of Prime Minister Liz Truss after the shortest tenure in British history.\n\nConfidence in Truss had collapsed after she presented a budget proposal featuring the UK’s largest tax cuts in 50 years, mainly benefiting the wealthy and corporations. Financial markets reacted with shock to the plan — which commentators dubbed “regressive” and “badly designed” — sending the pound plunging and steeply increasing the costs of government borrowing.\n\nBut Truss’s unprecedented failure is only the latest in a series of crises that have plagued Britain in recent years. Truss succeeded fellow Conservative Party member Boris Johnson, who was fined after revelations of secret parties he held in contravention of his own government’s Covid-lockdown rules. Johnson’s populist bluster was routinely peppered with false statements, and he eventually resigned after being caught in a lie about a top official’s sexual misconduct.\n\nJohnson’s predecessor, Theresa May, stepped down in 2019 after she couldn’t make good on her basic slogan to deliver Brexit, Britain’s breakup with the EU that UK voters had called for in a 2016 referendum. The decision to exit the 27-member bloc also caused the downfall of May’s predecessor, David Cameron, who had campaigned for the UK to remain in the EU ahead of the 2016 vote. Cameron quit shortly after the vote, in which 52 percent voted Leave.\n\nWhat’s behind these years of political chaos? I asked Matthias Matthijs, a senior fellow for Europe at the Council on Foreign Relations and an associate professor of international political economy at Johns Hopkins University’s School of Advanced International Studies. He’s also the author of Ideas and Economic Crises in Britain from Attlee to Blair (1945-2005).\n\nThere is one clear root cause of Britain’s woes, according to Matthijs: Brexit. The vote to Leave or Remain in the EU, he says, scrambled UK partisan affiliations and created new, polarized political identities around one dominant issue. The decision to leave unleashed serious economic aftershocks, which were impossible to ignore or paper over indefinitely. The result has been a chaotic, unsteady Britain, battling social malaise and political upheaval in the aftermath of the pandemic and amid an inflation crisis sweeping the global economy.\n\nI spoke with Matthijs on October 21 following the announcement of Truss’s resignation. (She will stay on until a successor is voted on, reportedly in the coming week.) A transcript of our conversation follows, edited for length and clarity.\n\nMichael Bluhm\n\nFrom the outside, the UK looks unstable. Conservatives won a decisive victory in the 2019 general election, but they have also gone through three prime ministers in three and a half years. How did Great Britain get to this point?\n\nMatthias Matthijs\n\nThis was the logical consequence of the Brexit vote. The Conservative Party made itself the party of Brexit, but they were never honest about the inevitable trade-offs of leaving the European Union. You gain sovereignty, but you’re going to have significant economic costs. You’re going to create trade barriers with your biggest trading partner, even though you’re going to be able to sign new trade deals with other countries.\n\nIn 2016, the question was, “Do you want to leave the European Union?” The answer was yes for 52 percent of voters. But in that referendum, they never asked or answered what was going to replace EU membership. And the UK now has to accept EU rules in dealing with the EU — without any say over the future of the EU.\n\nAhead of the general election in December 2019, Boris Johnson basically said, We’re going to cleanse the Tory Party of any Remainers. Everybody is now a committed Brexiteer. And they’re all committed to my version of Brexit, which is the hardest version of Brexit — meaning that we’re going to leave the EU completely — the single market, the Customs Union, everything.\n\nHe won a big majority in that election, and his government negotiated the trade deal that replaces EU membership. But that’s when Covid hit, so Covid masked the effects of leaving. Because of Covid, trade and travel collapsed, so all the problems with Brexit weren’t visible until the last year.\n\nThen Johnson resigned, which led to the rise of Liz Truss, also from the right of the party. Now the problem is that they’re quickly running out of political talent. They never committed to being honest about the trade-offs they were making. Liz Truss started to implement this fantasyland economic strategy, and that’s when the market started to panic.\n\nNow the UK has entered what in the 1990s was called emerging-market territory, where markets are starting to dictate fiscal policies. The Tories made it very hard for themselves by choosing this path, and the chickens are coming home to roost.\n\nMichael Bluhm\n\nYou mentioned the costs and trade-offs of Brexit. What were the economic costs of leaving the EU?\n\nMatthias Matthijs\n\nThe economic cost was measured at about 4 percent of GDP over 10 years. But it’s hard to show people that they don’t have something that they would have had. It’s a significant economic cost. Former Bank of England Governor Mark Carney pointed out that at the time of the Brexit vote, the UK economy was about 90 percent of the size of Germany’s economy. Now it’s about 70 percent of the size. The pound has weakened, too. There’s also been a lack of productivity and real economic growth.\n\nThere are a lot of other hassles. Travel to Europe, for example. Leaving the Customs Union means a lot more bureaucracy. Small businesses that had made the European market their main market now face problems: Instead of two-day delivery times, they have 20-day delivery times. For many customers, that’s too long. They’re losing that market without gaining new markets.\n\nA big cost is that the EU has an alphabet soup of regulatory agencies that regulate and set standards for every industry. But now all UK companies have to recertify themselves with a new UK regulator.\n\nIt’s not clear that there have been any real benefits. What do you have now that’s so great that you didn’t have when you were an EU member? Apart from the Imperial British stamp on a pint glass, they have very little to show for it.\n\nMichael Bluhm\n\nHow did Brexit affect the constituencies or the partisan identities of the two major parties?\n\nMatthias Matthijs\n\nThat’s an excellent question. The genius of Boris Johnson in the 2019 election was that he put together a coalition of voters that included liberal Leavers. This included people who wanted to leave the EU for cosmopolitan reasons, meaning they wanted more immigration from outside the EU. They wanted free trade deals with America and India. They wanted the sovereignty of Parliament to be central.\n\nOthers in this camp saw potential financial gain for the financial industry and especially the hedge fund industry, from the lower taxes and deregulation that would be possible through leaving the EU.\n\nBut Boris also appealed to a working-class constituency that had traditionally voted for Labour. The Tories promised more protection from the European market and from EU immigration. The strength of Boris Johnson is that he had that populist appeal with working-class voters that would never have worked with a cosmopolitan message — and he labeled Remainers as cosmopolitans.\n\nA lot of working-class voters, especially in the north of England — and in England in general — who voted for Brexit felt that the Labour Party was not representing them. They saw the party as highly educated professionals who didn’t care about the plight of the working class and were ready to disregard their votes to leave the European Union.\n\nThe Tories very cleverly put together a coalition not unlike how Donald Trump managed to win Rust Belt states in 2016. Boris Johnson promised that he was going to level up the country: More resources from London were going to be invested in the north of England and in the parts of England that were forgotten — the losers of globalization. That was going to be easier now because the EU had been very strict on industrial policy and similar things.\n\nBoris Johnson kept this Leave coalition together for a while. But Covid interrupted that, and his own lack of restraint finally led to his fall. But the difference between him and Liz Truss is that Truss doubled down on a low-tax, low-spending, deregulatory version of Brexit — what some call Singapore-on-Thames — which is a kind of Brexit that very few people voted for.\n\nThat made a lot of these voters who had voted Tory for the first time in their lives realize that Boris’s promises were never going to happen. The last few weeks were a bit of a moment of truth. That’s what we see reflected in the opinion polls where Labour is now riding incredibly high.\n\nMichael Bluhm\n\nYou say that Boris Johnson created this new coalition of Leave voters and the identity of being a Leaver was central to that. That sounds like he was cultivating political polarization around Brexit. How polarized is the British electorate now?\n\nMatthias Matthijs\n\nThe polarization around Leave versus Remain hit a high point in 2019. Then the election happened, and then Covid happened. Today, Labour is not promising a return to the EU. Labour is talking about how to make Brexit work.\n\nThe Leave-versus-Remain identity has weakened. Brexit has happened. It’s not something that you can ignite politically anymore. Now we’re back to old-fashioned questions of left versus right. How much should the government tax people to have better public services? Who should pay how much in taxes? What should government spend money on?\n\nWe’re back to a more normal politics. Liz Truss’s fiscal choices were so radical that any new Tory leader will have to shift back to the center, because otherwise they face electoral oblivion.\n\nMichael Bluhm\n\nWhere are voters’ sentiments now?\n\nMatthias Matthijs\n\nReality has hit for many Labour constituencies. Nothing changed. They voted Leave to show their discontent with the elite consensus on globalization and an economic future centered on cities and services. Then they voted for Boris Johnson, saying, Well, it feels like Labour hasn’t done anything for us, but maybe this guy will. Now, three years later, they feel like they haven’t seen any effort by the Conservatives to do anything for them, either.\n\nThey’ve reverted to the status quo ante. Identities are much more fluid, though, and it’s totally possible that a new Labour government would disappoint them, and then they switch back to the Tories.\n\nMichael Bluhm\n\nHow do you see the potential ways out of this political instability?\n\nMatthias Matthijs\n\nThe only way out is a new general election. The Conservative Party will resist it because they face electoral annihilation if they have an election soon, but the party is divided.\n\nThere is a more pragmatist, centrist line, represented by Jeremy Hunt, the new chancellor of the exchequer. They don’t want to cut taxes in the middle of high inflation. They believe that Britain does need more immigration — there’s a lack of labor supply because a lot of people left the UK because of Brexit.\n\nThe other wing is doubling down on cracking down on immigration. I don’t see how a new Conservative government can last beyond next spring or summer because the party is divided on fundamental questions of government.\n\nMichael Bluhm is a senior editor at the Signal.

It is not difficult to imagine how, once Trump is no longer President, his most fanatical supporters could apply this caveat to all levels of government, including local law enforcement. At the rally on December 12th, Nicholas Fuentes underscored the irreconcilability of a radical-right ethos and pro-police, pro-military patriotism: “When they go door to door mandating vaccines, when they go door to door taking your firearms, when they go door to door taking your children, who do you think it will be that’s going to do that? It’s going to be the police and the military.”\n\nDuring Trump’s speech on January 6th, he said, “The media is the biggest problem we have.” He went on, “It’s become the enemy of the people. . . . We gotta get them straightened out.” Several journalists were attacked during the siege. Men assaulted a Times photographer inside the Capitol, near the rotunda, as she screamed for help. After National Guard soldiers and federal agents finally arrived and expelled the Trump supporters, some members of the mob shifted their attention to television crews in a park on the east side of the building. Earlier, a man had accosted an Israeli journalist in the middle of a live broadcast, calling him a “lying Israeli” and telling him, “You are cattle today.” Now the Trump supporters surrounded teams from the Associated Press and other outlets, chasing off the reporters and smashing their equipment with bats and sticks.\n\nThere was a ritualistic atmosphere as the crowd stood in a circle around the piled-up cameras, lights, and tripods. “This is the old media,” a man said, through a megaphone. “This is what it looks like. Turn off Fox, turn off CNN.”\n\nOutside the Capitol, rioters surrounded news crews, chasing off the reporters and smashing their equipment with bats. Photograph by Balazs Gardi for The New Yorker\n\nAnother man, in a black leather jacket and wraparound sunglasses, suggested that journalists should be killed: “Start makin’ a list! Put all those names down, and we start huntin’ them down, one by one!”\n\n“Traitors to the guillotine!”\n\n“They won’t be able to walk down the streets!”\n\nThe radicalization of the Republican Party has altered the world of conservative media, which is, in turn, accelerating that radicalization. On November 7th, Fox News, which has often seemed to function as a civilian branch of the Trump Administration, called the race for Biden, along with every other major network. Furious, Trump encouraged his supporters to instead watch Newsmax, whose ratings skyrocketed as a result. Newsmax hosts have dismissed covid-19 as a “scamdemic” and have speculated that Republican politicians were being infected with the virus as a form of “sabotage.” The Newsmax headliner Michelle Malkin has praised Fuentes as one of the “New Right leaders” and the groypers as “patriotic.”\n\nAt the December 12th rally, I ran into the Pennsylvania Three Percent member whom I’d met in Harrisburg on November 7th. Then he had been a Fox News devotee, but since Election Day he’d discovered Newsmax. “I’d had no idea what it even was,” he told me. “Now the only thing that anyone I know watches anymore is Newsmax. They ask the hard questions.”\n\nIt seems unlikely that what happened on January 6th will turn anyone who inhabits such an ecosystem against Trump. On the contrary, there are already indications that the mayhem at the Capitol will further isolate and galvanize many right-wingers. The morning after the siege, an alternative narrative, pushed by Jones and other conspiracists, went viral on Parler: the assault on the Capitol had actually been instigated by Antifa agitators impersonating Trump supporters. Mo Brooks, an Alabama congressman who led the House effort to contest the certification of the Electoral College votes, tweeted, “Evidence growing that fascist ANTIFA orchestrated Capitol attack with clever mob control tactics.” (Brooks had warmed up the crowd for Trump on January 6th, with a speech whose bellicosity far surpassed the President’s. “Today is the day American patriots start takin’ down names and kickin’ ass!” he’d hollered.) Most of the “evidence” of Antifa involvement seems to be photographs of rioters clad in black. Never mind that, in early January, Tarrio, the Proud Boys chairman, wrote on Parler, “We might dress in all BLACK for the occasion.” Or that his colleague Joe Biggs, addressing antifascist activists, added, “We are going to smell like you, move like you, and look like you.”\n\nNot long after the Brooks tweet, I got a call from a woman I’d met at previous Stop the Steal rallies. She had been unable to come to D.C., owing to a recent surgery. She asked if I could tell her what I’d seen, and if the stories about Antifa were accurate. She was upset—she did not believe that “Trump people” could have done what the media were alleging. Before I responded, she put me on speakerphone. I could hear other people in the room. We spoke for a while, and it was plain that they desperately wanted to know the truth. I did my best to convey it to them as I understood it.\n\nLess than an hour after we got off the phone, the woman texted me a screenshot of a CNN broadcast with a news bulletin that read, “antifa has taken responsiblitly for storming capital hill.” The image, which had been circulating on social media, was crudely Photoshopped (and poorly spelled). “Thought you might want to see this,” she wrote.\n\nIn the year 2088, a five-hundred-pound time capsule is scheduled to be exhumed from beneath the stone slabs of Freedom Plaza. Inside an aluminum cylinder, historians will find relics honoring the legacy of Martin Luther King, Jr.: a Bible, clerical robes, a cassette tape with King’s “I Have a Dream” speech, part of which he wrote in a nearby hotel. What will those historians know about the lasting consequences of the 2020 Presidential election, which culminated with the incumbent candidate inciting his supporters to storm the Capitol and threaten to lynch his adversaries? Will this year’s campaign against the democratic process have evolved into a durable insurgency? Something worse?\n\nOn January 8th, Trump was permanently banned from Twitter. Five days later, he became the only U.S. President in history to be impeached twice. (During the Capitol siege, the man in the hard hat withdrew from one of the Senate desks a manual, from a year ago, titled “PROCEEDINGS OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE IN THE IMPEACHMENT TRIAL OF PRESIDENT DONALD JOHN TRUMP.”) Although the President has finally agreed to submit to a peaceful transition of power, he has admitted no responsibility for the deadly riot. “People thought that what I said was totally appropriate,” he told reporters on January 12th.\n\nHe will not disappear. Neither will the baleful forces that he has conjured and awakened. This is why iconoclasts like Fuentes and Jones have often seemed more exultant than angry since Election Day. For them, the disappointment of Trump’s defeat has been eclipsed by the prospect of upheaval that it has brought about. As Fuentes said on the “InfoWars” panel, “This is the best thing that can happen, because it’s destroying the legitimacy of the system.” Fuentes was at the Capitol riot, though he denies going inside. On his show the next day, he called the siege “the most awe-inspiring and inspirational and incredible thing I have seen in my entire life.”\n\nAt the heap of wrecked camera gear outside the Capitol, the man in the leather jacket and sunglasses declared to the crowd, “We are at war. . . . Mobilize in your own cities, your own counties. Storm your own capitol buildings. And take down every one of these corrupt motherfuckers.” Behind him, lights glowed in the rotunda. The sky darkened. At 8 p.m., Congress reconvened and resumed certifying the election. For six hours, Americans had held democracy hostage in the name of patriotism.\n\nThe storm might be here. ♦\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nTrump was impeached for a second time on January 13th.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

He said: “I’m confident in the US but we can’t be complacent.”\n\nThe Prime Minister’s spokesman downplayed suggestions the UK was at risk of being left behind, saying Britain had “significant strengths in AI” and “some very strong players in the market”.

In contrast, DeepSeek claims that one of its recent systems cost just $5.6 million to develop.\n\nThe claim sparked alarm about possible overspending by US companies.

DeepSeek refuses to answer questions on subjects such as the Tiananmen Square protests. It insists that Taiwan is an “inalienable part of China” and that reports of human rights abuses in Xinjiang are “unfounded and politically motivated”.\n\nWestern governments have cracked down on Chinese-owned apps such as TikTok in recent years amid cybersecurity fears and concerns that they could be used to promote Chinese Communist Party views.\n\nThe US has heavily restricted Chinese access to the most advanced AI microchips on national security grounds, with a series of trade measures that it had hoped would thwart the country’s advances.\n\nIn response to a tweet suggesting that DeepSeek had skirted US export restrictions to access thousands of high-end microchips, Elon Musk said: “Obviously.”\n\nDeepSeek said that it was limiting how many people could sign up “due to large-scale malicious attacks” on its services.\n\nRead the latest updates below.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nTrade controls forced Chinese researchers to use freely available tools creatively.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

She previously worked at Business Insider covering the military and global conflicts.\n\nThe short tenure of UK Prime Minister Liz Truss, seen here at a press conference on October 14, has been dominated by economic and political instability. Daniel Leal-WPA/Getty Images\n\nThe United Kingdom, not to mention the Conservative Party currently running it, is having a bumpy fall. So bumpy, in fact, that new prime minister Liz Truss has announced she will resign, after only six weeks in office.\n\n“I cannot deliver the mandate on which I was elected,” she said Thursday in brief remarks.\n\nTruss’s rapid fall from power came after she introduced Trussonomics, a plan for massive tax cuts aimed at Britain’s wealthiest, and then reversed course and apologized for all the economic turmoil the proposal created.\n\nThat proposed “mini budget,” which also included a rollback of corporate tax hikes and a break on planned cost increases for national insurance, had sent the British financial markets into a weeks-long tailspin. On top of a deepening cost-of-living crisis, Truss’s plan sent foreign investors fleeing from the British economy, driving the country’s currency to a record-low value against the dollar.\n\nThat economic chaos precipitated a political crisis: Truss’s grip on power slipped fast, as did public esteem for her Conservative Party.\n\nTruss had spent the past week trying to steady the economy and her premiership. On Monday, the UK’s new Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt announced a near-complete reversal of Trussonomics. That day, Truss told the BBC she would “accept responsibility and say sorry for the mistakes that have been made” and told interviewer Chris Mason that she intended to lead the Conservative Party through the next general election.\n\nHowever, the damage had already been done: She became the least popular prime minister in the history of polling. The Conservatives, or Tories as they’re commonly known, announced they will select their next leader — and therefore leader of the UK — by next Friday.\n\nIt’s an exceptionally fast timeline for the contest, which will be decided by Conservative members of Parliament and party members only. Quite a few names are already being floated, including some familiar ones: Rishi Sunak, who lost to Truss in the most recent contest, sure, but also Boris Johnson, who’s already being encouraged to return by his supporters.\n\nBut lurking underneath the immediate questions about leadership are bigger ones, about how much damage has been done to the Conservative Party as a whole.\n\n“This is end of times for the Conservatives unless they can get themselves back to some position of competence and some position of stability, which at the moment is looking very, very difficult,” Matthew Goodwin, a professor of politics at the University of Kent, told Vox earlier this week.\n\nTruss’s signature policy became her downfall\n\nTruss’s political crisis started with an economic one.\n\nOn September 23, Truss’s former chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng introduced the UK’s biggest tax cuts in 50 years, estimated at about 45 billion pounds over five years. The following Monday, investors soundly rejected the new economic plan, dubbed “Trussonomics” in reference to Reaganomics, the supply-side economic policies passed under Ronald Reagan in the 1980s. Global markets responded to the policy by selling off UK-backed assets and pushing the UK’s currency, the pound, to a valuation of $1.03, its lowest-ever value against the dollar, before it inched up later in the week.\n\nThe announcement of Kwarteng and Truss’s new plan also triggered a sell-off in government bonds — typically considered quite safe investments — which was so extreme that the Bank of England, the UK’s central bank, stepped in and purchased 65 billion pounds worth of bonds “to restore orderly market conditions” and float the country’s pension scheme.\n\nOne reason Trussonomics was so unnerving was the idea that the tax cuts would be financed by further borrowing. The UK already has a significant public debt burden — without new taxes, the UK’s Office for Budget Responsibility warned, public debt would balloon to 320 percent of Britain’s GDP in 50 years, up from 96 percent, or 2.4 trillion pounds, now.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) agreed, issuing an astonishing and nearly unprecedented rebuke against the tax cuts, which devalued the pound even further. “The nature of the UK measures will likely increase inequality,” the global lender said, urging the government to “consider ways to provide support that [are] more targeted and reevaluate the tax measures, especially those that benefit high-income earners.”\n\nIn the past week, Truss’s government had been trying to stanch the bleeding. Truss fired Kwarteng on October 14 and on Monday, Hunt, aiming to ease the economic crisis, made public the reversal of Truss’s economic plan, weeks earlier than planned.\n\n“We are a country that funds our promises and pays our debts,” Hunt said, rebuking Truss and Kwarteng’s intention to pay for their tax cuts by borrowing, and the very real possibility that their plan would eventually necessitate a cut in social services.\n\nHunt defended the reversal in Parliament later that day, with Truss sitting behind him, her silence telegraphing the rapid decline of her power and stature.\n\nThat day, Mark Blyth, director of the William Rhodes Center for International Economics and Finance at Brown University, told Vox via email that “she’s in charge, but she is clearly not in charge.” Hunt “defenestrated her. He is running the country. It’s like the shittiest Game of Thrones episode ever.”\n\nTruss’s tax cuts worked against her own government — and Conservative voters\n\nTruss inherited a bad economy and cost-of-living crisis from her predecessor. But “there might never have been a good time to push through tax cuts,” Nikhil Sanghani, managing director for research at the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (OMFIF), told Vox in an earlier interview.\n\nOn top of high inflation caused in part by the Covid-19 stimulus, stagnant wages, interest rate increases to combat the inflation, a weaker-than-expected economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic, and outrageous energy prices caused by Russia’s war in Ukraine amid one of the hottest summers on record, Truss’s tax plan was, he said, “the nail in the coffin in terms of, ‘Will there be a recession?’”\n\nTruss and Kwarteng proposed the policy as a way to jump-start the sluggish economy — essentially, trickle-down economics in the 21st century. But adding money to the pockets of the rich and large corporations with the assumption that they’ll use it in alignment with policy directives flies in the face of widely accepted economic theory. Moreover, injecting more money into an economy already suffering from an inflation crisis is illogical and contrary to the efforts of the Bank of England, which has raised interest rates seven times since December to help reduce the rate of inflation — now around 10 percent.\n\nTaxing income is another way to tackle inflation and provides the government with revenue to fund its programs, like pensions for the aging population and the National Health Service. Instead, the government “decide[d] to do massive tax cuts that may not be even stimulatory given that the skew on who gets the money makes the Trump tax cuts look like socialism,” Blyth said. “The people who get all the money will not spend it because they are already rich, and the people who need money to spend will get next to nothing and will then get slammed with a doubling of energy bills and a huge rise in their mortgage costs.”\n\nAlthough the government’s policy reversal seems to have rallied markets, it’s unclear what the lasting effect will be, particularly since there are so many mitigating factors like global inflation and the war in Ukraine straining the economy. It has, however, clearly highlighted that the Conservative Party is in trouble.\n\nAnd it’s not clear how the Tories will navigate that.\n\nWhat happens next with the prime minister contest — and the Conservative Party?\n\nThe future of the Conservative Party is in doubt, and its issues are a lot bigger than Truss.\n\nSome questions will be resolved in the next week. The party’s steering committee is meeting Thursday evening to hammer out the rules for the next leadership contest, and the party has promised it will all be wrapped up by October 28. (The last contest, after Johnson announced his resignation, took two months to complete.) In the final stage, Tory Party members may vote online.\n\nLikely contenders include Rishi Sunak, the former chancellor of the exchequer who went head-to-head with Truss last time; and Penny Mordaunt, another minister who was popular among her fellow conservative members of Parliament in the earlier stages of the previous contest. And though Hunt may run, and snap polling suggests that Britons approve of his decision to overturn Truss’s policies, that doesn’t mean he’s the obvious choice to replace Truss, since most voters won’t really know who he is or have had time to form an opinion on his policies.\n\nThere’s also already speculation — bolstered by calls from his allies — that Johnson may try to stage a return.\n\nBut whoever the next leader is will have to navigate longer-term questions about the Tories’ identity — and their appeal to the UK more broadly.\n\nTruss’s fall is partially of her own doing, but she was also operating within a party that‘s failed to coalesce under a united vision for the country post-Brexit. The Conservatives won their historic majority in 2019 by bringing new voters into the party. But without the unifying goal of getting Brexit done, the party has a serious issue with internal factionalization.\n\n“Conservatives are now very divided,” Goodwin said. “They have very different views on where they want to take the country. This is not like the US Republican Party that has been largely, almost completely realigned around [a] Trumpist message. This is a much more factional Conservative Party, with different wings — there’s a Boris Johnson wing, there’s a Liz Truss wing, there’s a One Nation liberal conservative wing, and that makes it difficult for the party to find a figure that everybody can agree on, to find policies that everyone can agree on.”\n\nNow public opinion is at an all-time low for Truss and her party. YouGov polls over the past nine months have put Labour firmly in the lead for the next government. After a series of mishandled crises under Tory leadership — from a rocky Brexit to former Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Covid-19 scandals and ensuing resignation to the cost-of-living and currency crises now — it seems that voters are ready to boot the Conservative Party.\n\nThe Tories have a constitutional mandate for several more years, but opposition leaders are clamoring for an early election amid this turmoil.\n\nLabour’s (also admittedly unpopular) leader Keir Starmer said his party had a platform ready to go if needed.\n\n“There’s a manifesto that is going to be ready whenever an election is called,” he said Thursday. “We’ve moved our teams onto a general election footing. And I’ve got in place all the grids I need for a general election. So we’re very, very prepared, should there be a general election.”\n\nTruss, at least, won’t be leading the Conservatives then — her unpopularity rivals that of only one other Briton, according to Goodwin. “She’s basically in what I would call Prince Andrew territory,” he said, referencing the disgraced brother of King Charles III, who was caught up in the Jeffrey Epstein scandal. “And you generally don’t tend to come back from Prince Andrew territory.”\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nLiz Truss fired Treasury chief Kwasi Kwarteng.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

They condemned efforts “at provoking violent clashes between Malians during the planned rally”.\n\nProtests had also been planned in the city of Ségou.\n\nOusmane Diallo, a Sahel researcher with Amnesty International’s regional office for West and Central Africa, told RFI the junta’s decision “violates the principles of freedom of association, freedom of peaceful assembly and also freedom of expression, which are guaranteed by the Malian constitution of 2023”.\n\nMali forum backs five-year presidency for junta leader Assimi Goïta\n\nGrowing protests\n\nAnger has been growing since a national council of political actors recommended that Goïta stay in power for another five years and that all political parties be dissolved.\n\nLast week’s suspension of parties also applied to civil society groups and led to Mali’s biggest protest movement in years.\n\nOpposition leaders and activists are now trying to build on momentum from large public rallies in Bamako on 3 and 4 May.\n\nSeveral hundred people turned out, holding signs calling for multi-party elections and chanting: “Down with dictatorship, long live democracy.”\n\nIn a statement on 30 April, Amnesty International said it was alarmed by proposals to dissolve political parties in Mali, warning this would amount to a serious attack on freedom of expression and association.\n\nThe group urged the authorities to stop what it called an escalating crackdown on civic space, and to respect the rights of all Malians, including critics, human rights defenders and opposition politicians.\n\nAmnesty also pointed to the 2023 constitution, brought in by the transitional authorities, which guarantees the existence of political parties and their right to “form and operate freely under the conditions determined by law”.\n\nPodcast: After Senegal's success, can Mali and Niger also hope for elections?\n\nPolitical uncertainty\n\nSo far, there is no sign of a mass uprising.

Referred to as the GENIUS Act, the bipartisan bill must be passed by the House before going to the president for his signature.\n\nOnly U.S.-regulated banks and other authorized firms would be permitted to issue stablecoins under the law.\n\nStablecoins would have to be backed 1:1 by U.S. dollars or other highly liquid assets, and issuers would be prohibited from paying interest on stablecoin holdings.\n\nForeign issuers would be allowed to sell their stablecoins in the U.S. if the issuer complies with certain conditions, including responding to seizure orders.\n\n\n\nLegislation regulating the issuance and distribution of stablecoins in the U.S. took a major step forward when the U.S. Senate passed the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act, better known as the GENIUS Act (the Act). The Act, which cleared the Senate in a 68-30 vote on June 17, 2025, awaits House passage and could be signed into law by President Donald Trump later this summer.\n\nWe outline below some key points in the Senate bill.\n\nStablecoins, which are typically digital assets pegged directly to a fiat currency, are one of the most common instruments used for conversions between cryptoassets. Many proponents also envision a broader role for stablecoins in the payments system, including as a means to effectuate traditional payments and cross-border transactions.\n\nPermitted issuers. The Act creates the concept of a “permitted payment stablecoin issuer,” which must be one of the following:\n\nA subsidiary of an insured depository institution that has been approved to issue stablecoins.\n\nA federal qualified payment stablecoin issuer that is regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.\n\nA state qualified payment stablecoin issuer that has a $10 billion or less market capitalization and is operating under federal standards or regulated by a state banking agency.\n\nBacking. Stablecoins must be fully backed on a 1:1 basis with U.S. dollars or other approved high-quality liquid assets such as Treasury bills. These reserves would need to be segregated from operational funds and only used to back the stablecoins. Issuers must also certify the sufficiency of their reserves on a monthly basis.\n\nForeign issuers. The rights of foreign stablecoin issuers has been a hotly debated topic. Under the Senate bill, foreign-issued stablecoins may be offered or sold in the U.S. if the foreign issuer has the technical capability to comply with lawful government orders (such as seizures) and is in compliance with any reciprocal arrangement between the U.S. and the issuer’s foreign jurisdiction. Whether the “and” should be an “or” is one of the key issues being debated.\n\nCompliance obligations. Issuers will be treated as “financial institutions” under the Bank Secrecy Act and subject to compliance with requirements relating to economic sanctions, anti-money laundering, and customer identification and due diligence.\n\nNonfinancial institution issuers. Another hotly debated issue is whether public companies not predominantly engaged in one or more financial activities can be permitted to issue stablecoins. Although not prohibited in initial drafts of the bill, it seems likely such a prohibition will make it into the final draft, subject to exceptions.\n\nPaying interest. The Act prohibits issuers from paying stablecoin holders any form of interest or yield solely in connection with the holding, use or retention of the issuer’s stablecoin.\n\nNaming the assets. Issuers cannot use any combination of terms relating to the U.S. government when naming their payment stablecoins, nor can they use anything that would give the impression that these are legal tender, or issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government.\n\nGiven the considerable debate and advocacy regarding several key provisions of the GENIUS Act, issuers and potential issuers of stablecoins, as well as service providers that might offer these digital assets, should closely monitor how the legislation advances this summer.\n\n(See also “The Proliferation of Cryptoasset Treasury Strategies in Public Markets” and “How Asset Managers Are Capitalizing on Hong Kong's Regulations Permitting Virtual Asset Funds.”)\n\nThis memorandum is provided by Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP and its affiliates for educational and informational purposes only and is not intended and should not be construed as legal advice.

How will he eventually go? Who is likely to succeed him? Surely a dictator so surrounded by sycophantic generals, spies and secret policemen could ward off any serious threat? There was no one obvious to lead a move to throw him out. Anyway, his successor might be even worse. The broad conclusion was that he could be with us for a long time.\n\nThese were always fragile arguments. No dictator foresees the coup that overthrows him. No one can follow all the intrigues from outside. All politicians eventually lose their political instincts. It took Mrs Thatcher thirteen years. Putin has been there nearly twice as long- and his position has become increasingly brittle.\n\nWhen he moved centre stage as president in 2000, Putin promised the Russians prosperity, stability and the restoration of their self-respect after the chaotic poverty and humiliation of the Yeltsin years. His innate political cunning was accompanied by good fortune. High oil prices gave him the money to meet most of his popular promises. People turned a blind eye to his brutal rule and the corruption of his associates.\n\nBut he became obsessed with Ukraine. Like many of his countrymen, he resented the way it had detached itself from Russia after what they saw as centuries of intimate partnership, and he was determined to do something about it. He began by interfering directly with Ukrainian domestic politics in order to increase his own influence and reduce that of the West. Next, by means of a rather well-executed coup de main, he annexed Crimea to Russia, claiming that Ukraine had acquired it illegally as the result of an irresponsible political gesture by the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev six decades earlier. Then, scarcely bothering to hide what he was doing, he gave military and political support to the rebels fighting to bring Eastern Ukraine into Russia.\n\nFinally, he launched a full-scale invasion, on the pretext that Ukrainian fascists had already begun a war with the help of the West, designed to destroy the thousand-year-old Russian state. He evidently thought that could quickly reduce Ukraine to a vassal or take it over entirely. The Ukrainians surprised him, the West, and perhaps even themselves by the courageous ingenuity of their resistance.\n\nPutin tried to compensate for military failure by a burst of patriotic hysteria. He then made a further massive misjudgement. No dictator in his right mind allows a subordinate to build an independent military force. But, as he ran short of Russian regular and conscript soldiers, he farmed out part of the battle to a crony from the lower depths of St Petersburg, Yevgeny Prigozhin, who contributed his own army of convicts sprung from the prisons of Russia. They were fairly effective and grotesquely brutal, but they were unable to break the Ukrainians.\n\nPrigozhin was scornful of the incompetent way the Russian military had managed the initial stages of the war. He was deeply resentful of their attempts to gain control over him. He claimed that they were deliberately starving his men of weapons and ammunition. The war, he went on to trumpet, was nothing to do with Ukrainian Fascists: it was simply a get-rich-quick scheme devised by greedy and ambitious generals for their own benefit. This was already a serious swipe at Putin. But on 23 June Prigozhin tipped over into armed rebellion. He and his men put tanks on the streets of Rostov-on-Don, the logistics and communications hub for the Russian army in Ukraine, and took over the military headquarters there. He demanded that the military leadership come to him: otherwise he would go to Moscow to get them himself. He claimed it was not a coup, but a demand for justice.\n\nAt first Putin appears to have tried force. There are stories that Prigozhin’s men were bombarded by missiles and attacked by helicopters. But he failed to clip Prigozhin’s wings. He then accused Prigozhin on television of betraying his country and his people in their time of need, and called for his arrest. He drew a remarkably inept parallel with the events of 1917 – it’s not clear whether he was referring to the mutinies that brought down the Tsar in February оr the march on the capital by a rebellious general in August. Either way, people’s blood must have run cold as they remembered the horrors which followed that disastrous year.\n\nPutin’s ministers and generals, his spies and his policemen, rallied round him, at least in public. So did thugs, such as Ramzan Kadyrov, who has ruled Chechnya since Putin pounded it into submission. The authorities dug up the roads to Moscow as Prigozhin and his soldiers approached. Abandoning his threat to prosecute the traitor, Putin got his crony, the Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko, to negotiate a deal. Saying he wanted to avoid bloodshed, Prigozhin marched his men back down the hill. It’s not yet clear where they will end up, or who will pay for them when they get there. But as they left Rostov they were cheered on the streets.\n\nPrigozhin bottled out and made a fool of himself. But Putin’s weakness has been shown up and his authority diminished. Much of the detail is still murky. The right-wing extremists who used to support Prigozhin are still around. We don’t know what the soldiers in the field or the wretched Russian people really think or how they will finally jump. We still have no idea how or when Putin will go, or who will succeed him. But the end of the Putin era is surely heaving into sight.\n\nMeanwhile, Moscow has a war to fight.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nPutin delivered a televised address accusing Prigozhin of treason.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

The model has rapidly gained popularity, igniting discussions across social media platforms and becoming a trending topic. Users have shared various memes and opinions, praising its capabilities and disruptive impact on the AI industry.\n\nDeepSeek-R1’s associated application has surged in downloads, becoming the most downloaded free AI app on the US Apple App Store. It achieved the top spot in India across all app categories, surpassing major players such as ChatGPT and Google Gemini. Sensor Tower data highlights that the app climbed from rank 102 on January 25 to rank 1 by January 27, maintaining its position the following day.\n\nThe app has also performed exceptionally well in the productivity app category, leaping from rank 132 on January 18 to the top position by January 27, displacing ChatGPT. On Android’s Play Store, DeepSeek-R1 has shown significant improvement, climbing from rank 447 on January 16 to rank 15 by January 28, trailing Google Gemini by just one position.\n\nPowered by a reasoning-based AI model with 670 billion parameters, DeepSeek-R1 stands as the largest open-source language model to date. Experts have drawn comparisons between its performance and OpenAI’s GPT-4, particularly in tasks related to mathematics, coding, and reasoning. What sets DeepSeek apart is its cost-effective development process—while OpenAI reportedly spent over $100 million on GPT-4, DeepSeek achieved similar capabilities for just $6 million by leveraging less advanced hardware combined with Nvidia A100 chips.\n\nBeyond the United States, the app has gained immense popularity worldwide. It has become the most downloaded application in countries such as the UK, Australia, Singapore, and Canada. However, its expansion across Europe has been relatively slower, indicating potential challenges in broader global adoption.\n\nAlso Read :- Nakul Jain Steps Down as Paytm Payments Services CEO\n\nChina’s growing expertise in artificial intelligence is evident in DeepSeek’s success. The company’s rise aligns with Beijing’s strategic focus on transitioning from traditional manufacturing to cutting-edge technologies. Despite international restrictions on advanced chip exports to China, DeepSeek has demonstrated an ability to innovate using available resources, raising questions about the effectiveness of such trade limitations.\n\nLike other AI models developed in China, DeepSeek incorporates safeguards to steer clear of politically sensitive subjects. When prompted about the 1989 Tiananmen Square incident, for instance, the app responded with a disclaimer—reflecting the constraints imposed by government regulations. While this censorship may hinder its acceptance in certain international markets, the model maintains high accuracy in other domains by integrating reliable data sources.\n\nThe rapid ascent of DeepSeek signals a notable shift in the AI industry. By combining affordability, scalability, and advanced reasoning capabilities, the company has emerged as a strong competitor to major industry players. Its rise not only disrupts the global AI landscape but also underscores the increasing influence of Chinese tech startups on the international stage.\n\nBe a part of Elets Collaborative Initiatives.

That process could take at least two years.\n\nBoris Johnson, the former mayor of London who campaigned for the UK’s departure from the EU, is tipped by bookmakers as Cameron’s likely successor.\n\nJohnson, who was greeted by a booing crowd when he left his home on Friday morning, thanked voters for their decision, pledged that the UK would remain committed to Europe and urged unity.\n\n“I think the electorate have searched in their hearts and answered as honestly as they can,” he said. “They have decided to vote to take back control from a European Union that has become too remote.”\n\nFormer PM: There will be costs\n\nFormer British Prime Minister Tony Blair told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer that UK voters would learn over the next 24 months that leaving Europe will not solve their economic troubles, ease their apprehensions or make Britain more independent in a meaningful way.\n\n“I literally cannot think of a big decision that I was not able to take because of Europe,” Blair said. “There is so much anger at the moment that the anger replaces the more rational answers.”\n\nBlair noted that the United States was facing the same type of political fracturing, brought on by economic turmoil, globalization and anger at immigration.\n\n“Getting out of Europe is not the answer,” he said, noting the UK sells half of its goods and services to the EU. “We are going to have to negotiate ourselves back into that market and it will be much more difficult than these people understand.”\n\nPossible Scottish independence vote\n\nIn Scotland, where support was overwhelmingly in favor of remaining in the EU, Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s First Minister and leader of the dominant Scottish National Party, said the outcome threw into doubt the future of her country’s place in the UK.\n\nShe said the Scottish government will begin preparing legislation for a new independence referendum if the Scottish Parliament decides it wants to hold one. Scots voted down a bid for independence from the UK in 2014.\n\n“Democratically unacceptable,” said Sturgeon in describing the fact that Scotland would be pulled out of the European Union despite the majority of the Scottish people voting to stay in.\n\nMORE: What does Brexit mean for you?\n\nSinn Fein calls for Irish unity\n\nThe Sinn Féin party in Northern Ireland called for a referendum on Irish unity, which could take Northern Ireland out of the UK and join it with the Republic of Ireland, an EU member.\n\nVoters in Northern Ireland voted for the UK to remain in the EU.\n\nSinn Féin President Gerry Adams said the Brexit result could portend tougher border rules – with barriers and custom posts – between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, because it will be the only land border between the EU and the UK.\n\nAdams said such a result would be unacceptable given the vote result in Northern Ireland and could undermine the cooperative relationships and that have developed between the two Irelands since the Good Friday agreement.\n\n“My issue is the north of Ireland is going to be dragged out of the EU on the decision made by people on another island,” said Adams, whose political party is dedicated to the reunification of Ireland.\n\n“We’re calling for a poll, a referendum, on Irish unity, on the border. This (the Brexit vote) has the potential to set back the good work that’s been done in terms of the peace process, building harmony, building infrastructure.”\n\n‘Dying’ institution\n\nAs European leaders faced their own crises, German Chancellor Angela Merkel stressed the “need to make sure that European people feel that the EU wants to improve all our lives.”\n\nShe said she greatly regretted the UK’s decision, but added, “The EU is strong enough to find the right answers today.”\n\nFrench President Francois Hollande called it a “painful choice which I deeply regret for the UK and Europe.”\n\nItaly’s finance minister, Pier Carlo Padoan, warned of a domino effect amid calls for further exit votes.\n\nFar-right Dutch politician Geert Wilders congratulated the UK on its decision and called for a Dutch referendum on EU membership.\n\n“We want to be in charge of our own country, our own money, our own borders and our own immigration policy,” he was quoted as saying in a statement on his website.\n\nMarine Le Pen, the leader of France’s National Front party who plans to run for the French presidency next year, also congratulated the Brexit side.\n\nHer party has suggested the French will also hold an “out” referendum if she assumes the presidency.\n\nPassions continued to run high in the UK in the hours after the vote, with UK Independence Party (UKIP) leader and Leave campaigner Nigel Farage declaring the EU a “dying” institution.\n\n“We’ve given ourselves the chance to rejoin the world,” he told journalists. “June 23rd needs to become a national bank holiday and we will call it Independence Day.”\n\nU.S. President Barack Obama said that while the UK’s relationship with Europe was changing, the ties that bound the UK to the United States and the United States to Europe would remain.\n\n“I do think yesterday’s vote speaks to ongoing changes and challenges that are raised by globalization, but the UK’s relationship with the EU will change. What will not change is the special relationship that exists between our two nations,” Obama said. “That will endure. And the EU will remain one of our indispensable partners.”\n\nMORE: Full coverage of the UK referendum\n\nNATO: UK will stay a strong ally\n\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg voiced reassurances that the United Kingdom will remain a strong and committed NATO ally despite the vote.\n\n“Today, as we face more instability and uncertainty, NATO is more important than ever as a platform for cooperation among European allies and between Europe and North America,” said Stoltenberg. “A strong, united and determined NATO remains an essential pillar of stability in a turbulent world and a key contributor to international peace and security.”\n\nVoters react\n\nThe referendum followed one of the most divisive political campaigns in recent memory. Polls consistently showed voters split down the middle, with the outcome too close to call ahead of the vote.\n\nNews of the decision sparked strong emotions, with those in favor and those against reflecting on a campaign marred by allegations of lies, distrust and hate.\n\n“This is so sad,” said Daniel Trilling on Twitter. “Millions of people aren’t going to feel any more in control of their lives or their country because of this vote.”\n\n“People vote on emotion,” Twitter user @cemanthe posted. “This was won on false promises and emotive texts about immigration. Not on facts.”\n\n“I am SO happy this morning,” wrote another, Gemma.\n\nAn online petition calling for a second referendum gathered more than 120,000 signatures within hours of being posted.\n\nLeading political figures gave mixed reactions.\n\nTony Blair, the former UK prime minister, called the decision a divided result.\n\n“It’s going to be a complicated process but it’s important to bring our country together and stabilize our country,” he told CNN’s Becky Anderson. “It’s still a resilient country and it’s a strong country.”\n\nSadiq Khan, the mayor of largely pro-EU London, said the decision was a “clear message” and urged calm.\n\n‘Taking back control’\n\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk said the decision was “historic, but not a moment for hysterical reactions.”\n\nDonald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee in the U.S. presidential election, hailed the UK’s decision to “reassert control over their own politics, borders and economy.”\n\nIn a news conference Friday as he attended the official opening of a remodeled golf resort bearing his name in Turnberry, Scotland, Trump called the decision of the voters “a great thing.”\n\n“They’re angry over borders, they’re angry over people coming into the country and taking over. Nobody even knows who they are,” he said. “They’re angry about many, many things. They took back control of their country.”\n\nUKIP’s Farage told CNN’s Nima Elbagir that the economic fears in the wake of the EU departure were overstated, and that he expected an even better relationship with the United States. He said the vote was a repudiation of bullying tactics by corporate and political powers to keep the UK in the EU.\n\n“(We were) threatened by everybody that if we didn’t stay part of this political union, dreadful things would happen to us, and what happened were the little people, the regular people, the ordinary people said, ‘No, this is wrong,’” Farage said.\n\n“When you really think about it, what we’ve done isn’t actually that radical. … We want to be a democratic nation. We want to make our own laws in our own parliament, have our own supreme court, and control our own border. If you think about, there’s now 183 countries around the world that have independence days. What we did yesterday was become 184th.”\n\nOpinion: Why Brexit vote should worry Trump\n\nMarkets plunge\n\nThe effects of the vote outcome were immediately felt in markets and economies around the world.\n\nIn New York, the Dow ended the day down more than 611 points, to close at 17,399. London’s FTSE index shed $164 billion of its value in the first 10 minutes of trading, but regained ground later in the day.\n\nThe NASDAQ index fell more than 4% and into a correction, or down 10% from recent highs.\n\nThe British pound at one point plunged more than 12% to below $1.34, its lowest level since 1985. Japan’s Nikkei tanked 6.7% and Hong Kong’s main index dropped 3.7%.\n\nBank of England Governor Mark Carney said the body is “well prepared” and “won’t hesitate” to take additional measures as markets adjust.\n\nThe “UK financial system is resilient,” he added.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nGlobal markets plunged following the Brexit vote.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

The former president, Donald Trump, recognized that the American people were tired of the ongoing war in Afghanistan, which was approaching its 20th year, and in February 2020, his administration negotiated with the Taliban to enable the U.S. to withdraw. In exchange for the release of 5000 Taliban fighters and the promise that the U.S. would withdraw within the next 14 months, the Taliban agreed not to attack U.S. soldiers.\n\nTrump’s dislike of the war in Afghanistan reflected the unpopularity of the long engagement, which by 2020 was ill defined. The war had begun in 2001, after terrorists affiliated with al-Qaeda attacked the United States on September 11 of that year. Taliban leaders in control of Afghanistan sheltered al-Qaeda, and after the attacks, the U.S. president, George W. Bush, demanded that Afghanistan hand over the terrorist leader believed to be behind the terrorist attack on the U.S: Osama bin Laden. In October, after Taliban leaders refused, the U.S. launched a bombing campaign.\n\nThat campaign was successful enough that in December 2001 the Taliban offered to surrender. But the U.S. rejected that surrender, determined by then to eradicate the extremist group and fill the vacuum of its collapse with a new, pro-American government. Al-Qaeda leader bin Laden escaped from Afghanistan to Pakistan, and the U.S. project in Afghanistan turned from an anti-terrorism mission into an effort to rebuild the Afghan government into a modern democracy.\n\nBy 2002 the Bush administration was articulating a new doctrine in foreign policy, arguing that the U.S. had a right to strike preemptively against countries that harbor terrorists. In 2003, under this doctrine, the U.S. launched a war on Iraq, which diverted money, troops, and attention from Afghanistan. The Taliban regrouped and began to regain the territory it had lost after the U.S. first began its bombing campaign in 2001.\n\nBy 2005, Bush administration officials privately worried the war in Afghanistan could not be won on its current terms, especially with the U.S. focused on Iraq. Then, when he took office in 2009, President Barack Obama turned his attention back to Afghanistan. He threw more troops into that country, bringing their numbers close to 100,000. In 2011, the U.S. military located bin Laden in Abbottabad, Pakistan, and launched a raid on the compound where he was hiding, killing him. By 2014, Obama had drawn troops in Afghanistan down to about 11,000, and in December of that year, he announced that the mission of the war—weakening the Taliban and capturing bin Laden—had been accomplished, and thus the war was over. The troops would come home.\n\nBut, of course, they didn’t, leaving Trump to develop his own policy. But his administration’s approach to the chaos in that country was different than his predecessor’s. By negotiating with the Taliban and excluding the Afghan government the U.S. had been supporting, the Trump team essentially accepted that the Taliban were the most important party in Afghanistan. The agreement itself reflected the oddity of the negotiations. Each clause referring to the Taliban began: “The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan which is not recognized by the United States as a state and is known as the Taliban will….”\n\nIt was immediately clear that the Taliban was not living up to its side of the bargain. Although it did stop attacking U.S. troops, It began to escalate violence in Afghanistan itself, assassinated political opponents, and maintained ties to al-Qaeda. Nonetheless, the Trump administration put pressure on the leaders of the Afghan government to release the 5000 Taliban prisoners, and they eventually did. Before Biden took office, Trump dropped the U.S. troop engagement in Afghanistan from about 13,000 to about 2500.\n\nWhen he took office, Biden had to decide whether to follow Trump’s path or to push back on the Taliban on the grounds they were not honoring the agreement Trump’s people had hammered out. Biden himself wanted to get out of the war. At the same time, he recognized that fighting the Taliban again would mean throwing more troops back into Afghanistan, and that the U.S. would again begin to take casualties. He opted to get the troops out, but extended the deadline to September 11, 2021, the twentieth anniversary of the initial attack. (Former president Trump complained that the troops should come out faster.)\n\nWhat Biden did not foresee was the speed with which the Taliban would retake control of the country. It swept over the regional capitals and then Kabul in about nine days in mid-August with barely a shot fired, and the head of the Afghan government fled the country, leaving it in chaos.\n\nThat speed left the U.S. flatfooted. Afghans who had been part of the government or who had helped the U.S. and its allies rushed to the airport to try to escape. In the pandemonium of that first day, up to seven people were killed; two people appear to have clung to a U.S. military plane as it took off, falling to their deaths.\n\nAnd yet, the Taliban, so far, has promised amnesty for its former opponents and limited rights for women. It has its own problems, as the Afghan government has been supported for the previous 20 years by foreign money, including a large percentage from the U.S. Not only has that money dried up as foreign countries refuse to back the Taliban, but also Biden has put sanctions on Afghanistan and also on some Pakistanis suspected of funding the Taliban. At the same time it appears that no other major sponsor, like Russia or China, has stepped in to fill the vacuum left by U.S. money, leaving the Taliban fishing for whatever goodwill it can find.\n\nYesterday, Josh Marshall of Talking Points Memo flagged tweets showing that members of the Afghan government, including the brother of the president who fled, are in what appear from the photos posted on Twitter to be relaxed talks about forming a new government. Other factions in Afghanistan would like to stop this from happening, and today Biden’s national security adviser Jake Sullivan warned that ISIS-K, another extremist group, is threatening to attack the airport to destabilize the Taliban.\n\nMeanwhile, there are 10,000 people crowded into that airport, and U.S. evacuations continue. The Kabul airport is secure—for now—and the U.S. military has created a larger perimeter around it for protection. The U.S. government has asked Americans in Afghanistan to shelter in place until they can be moved out safely; the Qatari ambassador to Afghanistan has been escorting groups of them to the airport. Evacuations have been slower than hoped because of backlogs at the next stage of the journey, but the government has enlisted the help of 18 commercial airlines to move those passengers forward, leaving room for new evacuees.\n\nYesterday, about 7800 evacuees left the Kabul airport. About 28,000 have been evacuated since August 14.\n\nInterestingly, much of the U.S. media is describing this scenario as a disaster for President Biden. Yet, on CNN this morning, Matthew Dowd, who was the chief strategist for the Bush-Cheney ticket in 2004, noted that more than 20,000 people have been evacuated from Afghanistan without a single loss of an American life, while in the same period of time, 5000 Americans have died from Covid-19 and 500 have died from gunshots.\n\n—-\n\nNotes:\n\nhttps://www.npr.org/2020/02/29/810537586/u-s-signs-peace-deal-with-taliban-after-nearly-2-decades-of-war-in-afghanistan\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2021/08/12/obama-afghan-war-ending-afghanistan-papers-book-excerpt/\n\nhttps://www.factcheck.org/2021/08/timeline-of-u-s-withdrawal-from-afghanistan/\n\nhttps://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/you-wouldnt-know-it-from-the-us-news-coverage-but\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/16/kabul-airport-chaos-and-panic-as-afghans-and-foreigners-attempt-to-flee-the-capital\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2021/08/22/afghanistan-biden-evacuations/\n\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2021/08/21/politics/kabul-airport-terror-warning/index.html\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/08/17/treasury-taliban-money-afghanistan/\n\nShare\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nOn August 15, 2021, the Taliban seized the presidential palace in Kabul and declared the war over.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

In the chaos, law enforcement officials said, one woman was shot and killed by Capitol Police.\n\nThe violent scene — much of it incited by the president’s incendiary language — was like no other in modern American history, bringing to a sudden halt the congressional certification of Joe Biden’s electoral victory.\n\nWith poles bearing blue Trump flags, a mob that would eventually grow into the thousands bashed through Capitol doors and windows, forcing their way past police officers unprepared for the onslaught. Lawmakers were evacuated shortly before an armed standoff at the House chamber’s entrance. The woman who was shot was rushed to an ambulance, police said, and later died. Canisters of tear gas were fired across the Rotunda’s white marble floor, and on the steps outside the building, rioters flew Confederate flags.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“USA! USA!” chanted the would-be saboteurs of a 244-year-old democracy.\n\nThe Senate stopped its proceedings, and the House doors were closed. In a notification, U.S. Capitol Police said no one would be allowed to come or go from the building as they struggled to regain control. “Stay away from exterior windows, doors. If outside, seek cover,” police warned.\n\nAll 1,100 members of the D.C. National Guard were activated, and Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) imposed a citywide curfew. From 6 p.m. Wednesday to 6 a.m. Thursday, Bowser said, no one other than essential personnel would be allowed outdoors in the city.\n\nThe mob had arrived hours earlier, charging past the metal barricades on the property’s outer edge. Hundreds, then thousands followed them. Some scaled the Capitol’s walls to reach entrances; others climbed over one another.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy day’s end, four people would be dead: one from gunfire and three from medical emergencies that officials have yet to explain.\n\nOn the building’s east side, police initially pushed the pro-Trump demonstrators back but soon gave up and fell back to the foot of the main steps. Within a half-hour, fights broke out again, and police retreated to the top of the stairs as screaming Trump supporters surged closer. After police perimeters were breached, the elated crowd began to sing the national anthem.\n\nFor an hour, they banged on the doors, chanting, “Let us in! Let us in!” Police inside fired pepper balls and smoke bombs into the crowd but failed to turn them away. After each volley, the rioters, who were mostly White men, would cluster around the doors again, yelling, arguing, pledging revolution.\n\nSometime after 2:10 p.m., a man used a clear plastic riot shield to break through the windows on a first floor to the south side of the building, then hopped in with a few others. Once inside, police suspect, rioters opened doors to let in more of their compatriots.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Capitol Police officer yelled from a higher stairway at the intruders, ordering them to stop, but when they didn’t, the officer fired at a man coming at him, two law enforcement officials said. Amid shouts and people rushing to get away from the sound of gunfire, rioters saw a woman in their group collapse. Police believe she was unarmed, a law enforcement official said, but the officer who shot her did not know that. Capitol Police had already been warned by D.C. police that many in the crowds were secretly carrying weapons.\n\n“They shot a girl!” someone yelled as a group of Trump supporters ran out of the southeast entrance.\n\nA team of paramedics with a gurney soon arrived and a Capitol Police officer stepped aside to let them pass. “White female, shot in the shoulder,” the officer said as they hurried past. They emerged minutes later.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the gurney was a woman later identified as Ashli Babbitt. Dressed in jeans, the 35-year-old gazed vacantly to one side, her torso and face covered in blood. Babbitt, a California native and an Air Force veteran, was a staunch supporter of the president.\n\nAs the gurney was loaded into the back of the ambulance, pro-Trump rioters swarmed around it, screaming, “Murderers!”\n\nCapitol Police officers with long guns pushed them back, and the ambulance drove off.\n\nInside, where the lawmakers had donned gas masks kept under their chairs, Rep. Jamie B. Raskin (D-Md.) could only think of his family as he and other lawmakers hid from the mob. Reeling from the loss of his 25-year-old son last week, Raskin had taken one of his daughters and his son-in-law to the Capitol to watch the debates unfold over certification of Biden’s election, he said, “because we wanted to be together.” Raskin was helping lead Democrats’ arguments against Republican objectors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I thought I could show them the peaceful transfer of power in the United States of America,” Raskin told C-SPAN earlier. “What was really going through my mind was their safety because they were not with me in the chamber, and I just wanted us all to get back together.”\n\nRep. Abigail Spanberger (D-Va.) said members were told that chemical irritants had been released in Statuary Hall and, for a moment, braced for the possibility that they would be exposed to tear gas. Capitol Police barricaded the doors with tables and bookshelves.\n\nSpanberger, a former CIA case officer, said that it was a crisis she would only expect to see unfold in fragile, faraway places.\n\n“This is what we see in failing countries,” she said. “This is what leads to a death of democracy.”\n\nThe shooting and the breach triggered an instant call for help across Washington to other law enforcement agencies. At the U.S. Secret Service, headquarters sent out an emergency alert to all gun-carrying Secret Service personnel to report to headquarters in preparation to help secure the Capitol.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, dozens of other rioters streamed into the building, where they smashed windows and vandalized offices amid furious clashes with officers desperate to maintain control.\n\n“MURDER THE MEDIA,” read a message written on one door.\n\n“WE WILL NOT BACK DOWN,” read another left in the office of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who also refused to back down, later directing her colleagues to return and finish validating Biden’s victory.\n\nRep. Karen Bass, a Democrat from California, shared a photo on Twitter of a long-haired man in a Trump hat carrying a rostrum adorned with the gold-colored seal of the speaker.\n\n“Arrest this man,” she demanded.\n\nAt 3:30 p.m., more law enforcement in riot gear arrived at the Capitol.\n\n“Traitors,” Trump supporters shouted. “What’s your oath?”\n\nBiden condemned what he called an “unprecedented assault” on American democracy, “unlike anything we’ve seen in modern times.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“This is not dissent. It’s disorder. It’s chaos,” he said. “It borders on sedition, and it must end now.”\n\nFor hours, Trump made little effort to quell the violence he had helped instigate, finally sharing a video at 4:17 p.m. in which he told people to “go home” — while continuing to promote the falsehood that he had won the election.\n\n“We love you,” he told them. “You’re very special.”\n\nThe Capitol has been the target of violence before. In 1954, Puerto Rican nationalists opened fire from a House gallery, injuring five lawmakers on the floor below. In 1971, a bomb planted by a radical left-wing group exploded, though no one was harmed. In 1998, a gunman opened fire, killing two Capitol Police officers. But not since the British set fire to the Capitol in 1814 has a mob overrun the ultimate symbol of American freedom.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe fallout on Wednesday was immediate, stunning the world, the country and, perhaps most of all, political Washington. Former presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton joined Republican Sen. Mitt Romney (Utah) in denouncing Trump for provoking the mob, while Twitter, Facebook and Instagram all temporarily banned him from their platforms. Several conservative lawmakers who had planned to object to Biden’s certification announced that they had changed their minds.\n\nShortly after 8 p.m., just an hour or so after hundreds of law enforcement officers had at last finished clearing the mob and removing Trump flags left inside the building, heavily armed FBI agents and police officers in riot gear escorted lawmakers back to work.\n\nAs discussion inside the battered building resumed, the sense of fear that had gripped the nation’s capital for much of the day had yet to subside.\n\nFederal agents were investigating a pickup truck found with weapons, ammunition and potential bombmaking material parked outside the Republican National Committee, according to two people familiar with the inquiry who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it. The truck, parked across the street from the party offices and near the entrance to a Metro station, contained rifles and shotguns and a mass of ammunition, these people said. Federal agents were still trying to determine whether that vehicle and its contents are connected to suspected pipe bombs found earlier in the day.\n\nBy late evening, D.C. Police Chief Robert J. Contee III said officers had arrested at least 52 people, including four for carrying pistols without a license, one for possession of a prohibited weapon and 47 for curfew violations and unlawful entry. Along with the pipe bombs, he said, police discovered a cooler packed with molotov cocktails on the Capitol grounds. In total, 14 D.C. officers were injured Wednesday. One was hospitalized after being pulled into a crowd and assaulted, and another received “significant facial injuries” after being hit with a projectile.\n\nJust past sunset, a man was stabbed at 12th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue NW, near Freedom Plaza, but it was unclear whether the attack was related to the assault at the Capitol, a mile east.\n\nThose who had made it inside the building took on a celebrity status when they came back out. A woman who said she had footage on her phone of Capitol Police pointing guns at rioters was circled by dozens who wanted to see it. People traded what information they had about the woman who was shot inside. Some called her a “martyr.”\n\nAfter she was taken away, the mood soured, though many remained joyous. “We’re making history,” one woman said as she strolled down Independence Avenue with friends.\n\nBeneath streaming flags, including some that read “F--- Biden” and that depicted Trump as the movie character Rambo, people loudly exhorted Jesus and chanted “USA!”\n\nMany called friends and family and took videos.\n\n“We weren’t violent before, but we are now,” a middle-aged White man said, talking into his cellphone. “There’s no going back.”\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nA woman was shot inside the Capitol and died.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Groups in China and South Korea have also raised concern, making it a political and diplomatic issue.\n\nBut the Japanese government and TEPCO say the water must be released to make room for the plant's decommissioning and to prevent accidental leaks. They say the treatment and dilution will make the wastewater safer than international standards and its environmental impact will be negligibly small. But some scientists say long-term impact of the low-dose radioactivity that remains in the water needs attention.\n\nThe water release begins more than 12 years after the March 2011 nuclear meltdowns, caused by a massive earthquake and tsunami. It marks a milestone for the plant's battle with an ever-growing radioactive water stockpile that TEPCO and the government say have hampered the daunting task of removing the fatally toxic melted debris from the reactors.\n\nThe pump activated Thursday afternoon would send the first batch of the diluted, treated water from a mixing pool to a secondary pool, where the water is then discharged into the ocean through an undersea tunnel. The water is collected and partly recycled as cooling water after treatment, with the rest stored in around 1,000 tanks, which are already filled to 98% of their 1.37-million-ton capacity.\n\nThose tanks, which cover much of the plant complex, must be freed up to build the new facilities needed for the decommissioning process, officials said.\n\nPrime Minister Fumio Kishida said it is indispensable and and cannot be postponed. He noted an experimental removal of a small amount of the melted debris from the No. 2 reactor is set for later this year using a remote-controlled giant robotic arm.\n\nTEPCO executive Junichi Matsumoto said Thursday's release was to begin with the least radioactive water to ensure safety.\n\nFinal preparation for the release began Tuesday, when just one ton of treated water was sent from a tank for dilution with 1,200 tons of seawater, and the mixture was kept in the primary pool for two days for final sampling to ensure safety, Matsumoto said. A batch of 460 tons was to be sent to the mixing pool Thursday for the actual discharge.\n\nBut Fukushima's fisheries, tourism and economy — which are still recovering from the disaster — worry the release could be the beginning of a new hardship.\n\nFukushima's current fish catch is only about one-fifth its pre-disaster level, in part due to a decline in the fishing population. China has tightened radiation testing on Japanese products from Fukushima and nine other prefectures, halting exports at customs for weeks, Fisheries Agency officials said.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nA TEPCO staff member activated a seawater pump and an operator confirmed the release.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

In a newly published study, we show that through activities like debris burning, equipment use and arson, people ignited 97% of home-threatening wildfires in the wildland-urban interface between 1992 and 2015. For comparison, when fires in undeveloped areas are also counted, humans started 84% of all wildfires between 1992 and 2012, with lightning as the main natural cause.\n\nCommon and costly\n\nWildfires in developed areas threatened one million homes across the lower 48 states that sat within their boundaries in the years we reviewed in our study. This figure is five times larger than previous estimates, which did not consider the threat of small fires – those measuring less than 1.5 square miles (4 square kilometers).\n\nHuman-started fires in these zones carry a high price tag. Over 15 years, between 2000 and 2014, state and local governments spent US$4.1 billion fighting wildfires near homes. That’s equivalent to one-third of the national wildfire control budget, even though the wildland-urban interface represents only 10% of U.S. land area.\n\nAnd development in these areas is increasing. Between 1990 and 2015, 32 million new homes were built in the wildland-urban interface – a 145% increase.\n\nWildfires in developed areas threatened one million homes across the lower 48 states that sat within their boundaries in the years we reviewed in our study.\"\n\nSince 2000, wildfires have burned 10 of the largest areas since 1970. During these years, average U.S. summertime (June- August) temperatures rose steadily. (Fire data from NIFC, temperature data from NOAA). Nathan Mietkiewicz, CC BY-ND\n\nClimate change is adding to the problem by making much of the U.S. West hotter and drier, and thus more prone to burn. Warming that has already occurred is linked to a doubling of cumulative burned area across Western U.S. forests since 1984.\n\nAs warming continues, small fires started by people either accidentally or deliberately in the wildland-urban interface could grow into large fires. Longer fire seasons, increased burning and having more homes to protect pose a potentially insurmountable resource challenge.\n\nBut the fact that people start the vast majority of wildfires that threaten homes also means it is possible to remove these wildfires from the equation. The way to do this is by altering common human behaviors that introduce ignitions. Key solutions may include:\n\nSince 2000, wildfires have burned 10 of the largest areas since 1970. During these years, average U.S. summertime (June- August) temperatures rose steadily. (Fire data from NIFC, temperature data from NOAA). Nathan Mietkiewicz, CC BY-ND\n\n– Doing more routine maintenance of infrastructure, such as electric power lines.\n\n– Organizing campaigns to reduce use of fireworks and other explosives.\n\n– Limiting use of motorized equipment for yard work and banning debris burning during hot and dry conditions.\n\n– Conducting more planned burns in high-risk areas like the wildland-urban interface during low-fire risk times of year. This work should target areas in these zones where ignition rates and threats to homes are high. These areas should receive high priority for fuel treatments or prescribed burning as preventative measures.\n\nCurrent trends suggest that people are not going to stop moving to beautiful but flammable areas. This means that more homes will be vulnerable to wildfires, and more people will be engaging in activities that could start them.

After 17 years of being called Facebook, the social networking parent company behind Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus has a new name.\n\nFacebook’s corporate entity is now Meta.\n\nFacebook creator Mark Zuckerberg announced the change at the company’s AR/VR-focused Connect event, sharing that the new title captured more of the company’s core ambition: to build the metaverse.\n\n“To reflect who we are and what we hope to build, I am proud to announce that starting today, our company is now Meta. Our mission remains the same — it’s still about bringing people together. Our apps and our brands — they’re not changing either,” Zuckerberg said. “From now on, we’re going to be metaverse-first, not Facebook-first.”\n\nThe name change comes at a… convenient time for Facebook, which has seen a sustained backlash to its brand, particularly in recent weeks after a former employee leaked a trove of documents to the media and government bodies detailing the missteps Facebook has made over the years in building out its platform responsibly. Facebook had been laying the groundwork for this change for months, seemingly in an effort to move its core branding further from the relentless negative headlines surrounding its most popular product, which has been a lightning rod for angst among consumers.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $475 on your TechCrunch All Stage pass Build smarter.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\n\nIn July, CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced in a Verge profile that Facebook was betting it all on the metaverse. It was a surprise announcement for the trillion-dollar company, mainly because while Facebook has spent plenty of money and effort on virtual reality hardware, its social VR products have largely been short-lived failures and it had said barely anything about its beta Horizons social platform since announcing it more than a year-and-a-half earlier.\n\nIn August, Facebook organized an unusually large press push around a VR app designed to let people take meetings in VR. Zuckerberg hit the morning shows and dedicated a surprising amount of effort toward showcasing the small VR app.\n\nIn September, in a blog post called “Building the Metaverse Responsibly,” Facebook announced a $50 million fund dedicated toward investment in research “to ensure these products are developed responsibly.” This month, Facebook announced a smaller $10 million creator fund for developers on its nascent Horizon Worlds platform, and also detailed that it planned to hire a whopping 10,000 employees in the EU specifically to build out their metaverse platform.\n\nLast week, a story in The Verge floated that Facebook was mulling a name change to their corporate entity.\n\nUltimately, distancing the company’s core business from a product associated with the most problems is an unsurprising move for them, but changing its name to Meta will require Facebook to align its core brand with a product that could be years from relevancy and could encounter many failures on the way to potential mainstream success. Facebook still has 2.5 billion users, while their metaverse products likely have a few thousand users, at most.\n\nA major name change from one of tech’s biggest companies isn’t without precedent. In 2015, Google rolled out a new corporate structure of its own, creating a parent company known as Alphabet. Google remains a subsidiary of Alphabet, but colloquially most people still call anything having to do with the company or its subsidiaries “Google,” for better or worse. After almost two decades of building its brand and growing its products to almost three billion monthly users, Facebook can probably expect the same treatment.\n\nWhile Google wasn’t trying to put distance between itself and its own name, Facebook has very different reasons for a rebrand. The company’s business continues to soar, but its brand has taken a beating in recent years, from Russian election disinformation in 2016, to major privacy lapses like the Cambridge Analytica scandal and now the flurry of ongoing revelations from Frances Haugen, a former member of Facebook’s civic integrity team turned Facebook whistleblower.\n\nFacebook is also arguably under more regulatory scrutiny at the moment than any other company in the tech industry. In Congress, where lawmakers seldom agree on anything, Republicans and Democrats have united in their shared distaste for the company’s unfettered growth, cutthroat business tactics and concerns over Instagram’s detrimental effects on teen mental health.\n\nDuring a Senate hearing last week with TikTok, Snap and YouTube, each social media company scrambled to explicitly contrast their own business practices with Facebook. YouTube posited that it didn’t “prioritize profits over safety.” Snap pointed to its own focus on ephemeral conversations, while TikTok argued that it thinks carefully about the wellbeing of teen users. But the efforts by Facebook’s peers appeared to be in vain.\n\n“Being different from Facebook is not a defense,” Senator Richard Blumenthal said. “That bar is in the gutter.”\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nAndrew Bosworth announced the retirement of the Oculus name.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA. A whistleblower turned over internal Facebook documents to Congress and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nB. Mark Zuckerberg announced Facebook was betting on the metaverse in July.\nC.

Most had been isolating for months as the coronavirus pandemic took hold.\n\nBut the death of yet another Black person at the hands of police seemed to shatter a dam in the American conscious.\n\nProtesters march from Lafayette Square to the US Capitol on May 29, 2020, to protest George Floyd's murder earlier that week. Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe 7-acre green space just north of the White House, known as Lafayette Square, had been a rallying place for change for more than a century, from women’s suffrage marches in 1917 to the fight for racial equality and gay rights half a century later.\n\nAnd so it was where protesters gathered to mourn the death of this 46-year-old father, George Floyd.\n\nFor Thomas, standing among the thousands of Americans of all races and faiths and demanding racial equality changed the way she thought about criminal justice and her role as a pastor serving a nearby church.\n\nIt was “this cathartic release, this need to demonstrate, to protest, to yell and to not hold the grief that this had triggered,” she said.\n\nAs the crowd chanted the names of Black lives lost to police violence – Tamir Rice, Sandra Bland, Eric Garner, Breonna Taylor – it began to feel to Thomas like a prayer.\n\n“That was a holy experience for me that is unmatched,” she said.\n\nThe daytime demonstrations were largely peaceful.\n\nBut as night fell on Washington – and other American cities – their tone changed.\n\nProtesters confront police on May 30, 2020.

Eric Baradat/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAfter nights of clashes, then-President Donald Trump, known for issuing directives and invectives through social media, fired off a series of posts shortly before 1 a.m. on Friday, May 29, 2020.\n\nHe condemned protests in Minneapolis that had become violent.\n\n“These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd,” he wrote before pivoting to a stark ultimatum:\n\n“Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts.”\n\nOutside the White House that evening, people began throwing rocks. Some tried to topple police barricades. The Secret Service rushed Trump and his family to the executive mansion’s bunker.\n\n“Nobody came close to breaching the fence,” Trump posted the following day. “If they had, they would have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen.”\n\nTrump’s allusions to police brutality – the very thing demonstrators were protesting – only seemed to rile them and underscore what was at stake.\n\nIt was also prescient.\n\nDemonstrations kept swelling through the weekend. Offices and other buildings around Lafayette Square were boarded up. But it didn’t stop the destruction.\n\nCrews board up buildings May 31, 2020, near the White House. Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images\n\nThe windows of Michelle Brown and Linda Neumann’s tea shop by the White House were smashed and the café set on fire, they told an influential city magazine. Even so, Brown quickly took to social media to underscore her support for those peacefully demanding change:\n\n“Before anyone puts a single word in our mouths,” she wrote: “Black lives matter.”\n\n“There’s insurance to cover things like this,” Neumann told the magazine. “We are both just so sad and heartbroken about what’s happening in the country and how things came to this.”\n\nThen, late Sunday night, an arsonist set fire to the basement of St. John’s Church, a landmark crowning the top of Lafayette Square and often referred to as the “presidents church” because so many have worshipped there.\n\nThe physical damage was minimal. But the flames ignited a series of events that soon would alter the landscape of the district itself.\n\nA man is injured during a May 30, 2020, protest near the White House.

Eric Thayer/Reuters\n\nThe following day, officials in Hennepin County, Minnesota, ruled Floyd’s death a homicide, codifying what many already sensed:\n\nFloyd’s life had been taken, and someone should be held accountable.\n\nProtesters again gathered outside the White House. Only this time, they were met by police.\n\nThe law enforcement presence was subtle at first. Officers observed from the park as demonstrators waved signs and chanted, “Hands up, don’t shoot!” and “No Justice! No Peace.”\n\nBut as the day wore on, the police presence grew. Journalists noticed.\n\n“These protests until now have been entirely calm,” CNN correspondent Alex Marquardt told Wolf Blitzer.\n\nUS Park Police stand watch June 1, 2020, as demonstrators protest at Lafayette Square.

Hundreds of National Guard troops staged near the park. A line of mounted police officers towered above the protesters and kept watch.\n\nThe White House announced Trump would make a statement in the Rose Garden.\n\nThe officers, Marquardt said, began to pull on gas masks.\n\nIn seconds, things went from peaceful to pandemonium.\n\nCNN\n\nA woman cries out after being exposed to tear gas on June 1, 2020, near the White House.

People fell. Others took a knee before the advancing line of police.\n\nMany retreated toward St. John’s Church.\n\nAs police descended, Thomas thought of the 1965 civil rights march to Montgomery, Alabama, that saw a young activist named John Lewis beaten bloody on a bridge in Selma.\n\n“All that was missing was a water hose and some dogs,” she recalled. “We’re marching to advance a cause – to say you can’t just kill people without due process – and you’re pushing us back with violence.”\n\nTear gas canisters cracked like thunder, and flash bangs echoed across White House lawns. Somehow, the Rose Garden maintained a relative tranquility, and from it, Trump spoke to the American people.\n\n“I will fight to protect you. I am your president of law and order and an ally of all peaceful protesters,” he said as helicopters whirred.\n\nTrump called on mayors and governors across the country to “dominate the streets” and “establish an overwhelming law enforcement presence until the violence has been quelled.”\n\nThen, he left the stage and made his way across the park.\n\nStanding in front of the boarded-up St. John’s Church, the president posed with a Bible, holding it in the air.\n\n“We have a great country,” he told reporters.\n\nPresident Donald Trump walks on June 1, 2020, between lines of riot police toward St. John's Church. Tom Brenner/Reuters\n\nCNN\n\nIt wasn’t long before pundits launched debates over Trump’s sacred prop, critics argued about the use of active-duty military against Americans exercising First Amendment rights and politicians lined up to assign blame.\n\nIn the office of the mayor of Washington, DC, the response was quieter as officials moved into action to make clear to the world – and the president living down the street – the city’s undisputed stance on the moral moment gripping the nation.\n\nFirst, they called Keyonna Jones.\n\nAn artist born and raised in Southeast DC, Jones – like many Americans – had been struggling to reconcile her own struggles in the pandemic with the injustice of Floyd’s death, she said.\n\nAll the same, she answered the phone. And in less than 24 hours, she was across town on 16th Street NW.\n\nWith an army of volunteers, friends, neighbors and municipal workers, Jones began to emblazon the two blocks leading directly to the White House with 50-foot letters that spelled out the moment’s words of empowerment so indelibly, they could be seen from space:\n\nA satellite photo shows the new plaza in June 2020. Maxar Technologies/Reuters\n\nOn June 5 – just 11 days after Floyd took his last breath – the district officially unveiled Black Lives Matter Plaza. The date happened to coincide with the birthday of Breonna Taylor, the Black American whose life had been cut tragically short that March in an encounter with police.\n\n“We know what’s going on in our country,” Mayor Muriel Bowser said. “We had the opportunity to send that message loud and clear on a very important street in our city … And that message is to the American people that Black Lives Matter, that Black humanity matters, and we as a city raise that up as part of our values.”\n\nKeyonna Jones\n\nCNN\n\nOther cities followed suit. In Montgomery, Alabama, the phrase marked the spot where enslaved people once were auctioned. In Tulsa, Oklahoma, the same kind of yellow letters were painted along Greenwood Avenue in homage to the lives stolen in the 1921 Race Massacre. New York commissioned a mural along 5th Avenue, just outside Trump Tower. More murals appeared in Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom.\n\nThey often were spurned. Many were vandalized. And some people, including Trump, saw them as divisive. He called Manhattan’s mural a “symbol of hate.”\n\nEven some within the Black Lives Matter movement declared the murals “performative,” an attempt by public officials to absolve themselves of the immensely hard work of rooting out systemic racism.\n\n“I think art is part of activism,” countered Jones, the artist. “It’s a universal language – people will see it, people will feel it and it’s starting a conversation that may not have happened.”\n\nNew York's Black Lives Matter street mural is vandalized on August 23, 2020, in a counter-protest outside Trump Tower.

The 80-year-old was battling pancreatic cancer, but he was determined to see the mural in person, a spokesperson said.\n\nForty days later, he died.\n\nThe district the following year spent millions making the mural a permanent installation, replacing traditional asphalt with colored pavers to spell out its eponymous phrase. The goal, the mayor said, was to transform “the mural into a monument.”\n\nIn its quieter moments, the public art acted as a beacon, calling on Americans – together – to mourn, celebrate, argue, strategize and reflect on the ongoing fight against racism in the United States and the nation’s commitment to equality.\n\nAnd, sure enough, it outlasted the pandemic. And the trial and conviction of Floyd’s murderer. And the entire Biden administration. And Trump’s return this year to the White House.\n\nThousands gather on November 7, 2020, at Black Lives Matter Plaza in Washington to celebrate Joe Biden's electoral victory.

Al Drago/Getty Images\n\nThen, after nearly five years of the plaza hosting moments both horrifying and holy, a Republican congressman from Georgia introduced a bill that would have withheld federal funding from Washington, DC, unless the mural was erased.\n\nFacing political pressure unlikely to soon relent, Bowser’s office ultimately announced the artwork – with the plaza’s official designation – would be removed.\n\nOn a Sunday this March, dozens of visitors paused at the intersection of 16th and I Streets NW to take final photos before construction crews pulverized Black Lives Matter Plaza into dust and piles of rock.\n\n“To me, this is part of our history,” one man told CNN in those final days. “It’s showing that we are trying to make progress and then they’re gonna tear it down? That doesn’t make sense.”\n\nAs Thomas watched the construction crews and excavators, she felt gutted and angry. In the nearly five years since Floyd’s death, she’d opted against preaching from the pulpit and instead ministered directly to activists and advocates leading protest movements across the country.\n\nWitnessing the ordered destruction, she wondered: “Are you thinking if you dig this up … you can just erase what we’ve done here?”\n\nCNN\n\nThen, in full view of the workers, Thomas picked up a chunk of the mural and walked away.\n\nIt was “an act of defiance, an act of resistance,” she said. “You can’t erase memory. You can’t erase conviction.”\n\nJones felt much the same way. Five years after her artwork drew global attention, the United States has seemingly returned to its status quo, she said, with conversations about – and, more importantly, actions toward – racial equality fading again into the background.\n\nStill, the artist said, her father recently reminded her of a speech by the Rev. Jesse Jackson, the civil rights leader who rushed to but could not save a dying Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nIn the speech, Jackson invoked the biblical boy David who fells the giant Goliath and encouraged Americans to continue to fight systems of injustice and not to be brought down by the “margin of despair.”\n\n“We have to recognize that we’re Davids,” Jones said. “There are rocks laying around that we can use to defeat the system.”\n\nWe just have to pick them up.\n\nTears roll down the face of Starlette Thomas on March 10 as she holds a chunk of pavement from the Black Lives Matter Plaza mural.

Doctors fought to save Mr Abe’s life, but despite a few moments of consciousness after the shooting, the former PM was described as being continuously comatose during desperate efforts of medical resuscitation. Responding to this apparent act of political violence, PM Fumio Kishida condemned the attack, saying: “It is barbaric…and it cannot be tolerated.” The Fire and Disaster Management Agency had earlier confirmed that Mr Abe had a bullet wound on the right of his neck, and also suffered subcutaneous bleeding under the left part of his chest. Mr Abe was said to be responsive in the minutes after the attack, but the 67-year-old’s situation later deteriorated. Eyewitnesses saw a man firing twice at Mr Abe from behind. Security officers detained the attacker, who made no attempt to run, and seized his weapon – reportedly a handmade gun.\n\nThe suspect has been identified as Nara resident Tetsuya Yamagami. Local media reports say he is believed to be a former member of Japan’s Maritime Self-Defense Forces, and that it was an improvised firearm. Explosives have subsequently been found at the suspect’s home. On Japanese social media, the hashtag, “We want democracy, not violence” was trending, with many social media users expressing their disgust towards the incident.\n\nPolitically hawkish, Shinzo Abe favoured revision of Japan’s pacifist constitution, and honoured the Yasukuni Shrine, itself controversial primarily because its Book of Souls contains the names of more than a thousand war criminals from WW2. Naturally, world leaders are stunned by Shinzo Abe’s murder. Japan’s own Foreign Ministry and several prominent politicians in Japan and abroad warned of ‘attacks on supporters of democracy everywhere’. British PM Boris Johnston described his murder as “despicable”, while French President, Emmanuel Macron said it was “an atrocity”. Antony Blinken, US secretary of state, described the shooting as a “very, very sad moment”,” speaking from the G20 in Bali, Indonesia. Former US president Donald Trump called it “a tremendous blow to the wonderful people of Japan”. Japan’s fellow Quad members, Australia, India and the US, were among the first to respond after the shooting. China’s foreign ministry also expressed “shock” at Abe’s shooting and extended condolences to his family. Kevin Rudd, the former Australian PM, called it, “a sober reminder to all our democracies of how precious our freedoms are…. an attack on supporters of democracy everywhere.”\n\nIndia’s PM Narendra Modi said he was, “deeply distressed”. Tsai Ing-wen, Taiwan president, condemned the “violent and illegal acts”. Abe’s public support for Taiwan had strengthened since he left office in the face of rising Chinese aggression against the democratic nation. Charles Michel, European Council president, said he was “shocked and saddened by the cowardly attack on Shinzo Abe… [The] EU stands with the people of Japan and [prime minister Fumio] Kishida in these difficult times.” Abe had previously outraged Chinese nationalists. A Weibo comment about the incident immediately went viral across the PRC: “Don’t forget that he visited the Yasukuni Shrine,” referring (above) to the controversial memorial that honours Japan’s war dead. Leif-Eric Easley said the shooting was a “major shock for Japanese politics and society…But Japan’s foreign policy will probably remain consistent, focused on strengthening the rules-based order with the USA and other international partners.” Anthony Albanese, Australia’s prime minister, observed, “our thoughts are with his family and the people of Japan at this time”.\n\nIn Japan, possession of firearms is restricted, and while political violence is not unheard of, Abe’s shooting revisits the memories of Japan’s Pre-World War II era. For example, PM Hirobumi Ito was killed in 1909—after he had left office—at a train station in Japanese-occupied northeast China. Indeed, Tokyo Station still bears an inscription near the site where another PM, Takashi Hara was fatally stabbed on Nov. 4, 1921. Japan’s political violence intensified during the 1930s as ultra-rightists sought to destroy the multiparty constitutional government. For example, an attempted coup on February 26, 1936, assassinated finance minister, Korekiyo Takahashi, and others, wounded the PM, and almost overwhelmed legitimate democratic government. The coup was quashed, but at the expense of growing military influence over the government.\n\nPost WW2, as Japan metamorphosed into a democracy, political violence lessened, but even so there were still outbreaks of riots and assassinations. In 1960 Otoya Yamaguchi stabbed to death Mr Inejiro Asanuma, leader of the Japanese Opposition Socialist movement. In 2007, Nagasaki’s Mayor, Iccho Ito, a fervent opponent of nuclear weapons, was shot dead by a right-wing group. Prior to this was the stabbing to death of Koki Ishii, an outspoken member of the opposition Democratic Party of Japan. These events show that Japan does to an extent possess a submerged history of political violence, uncannily in a country known for its post-WW2 pacifism and high level of public safety. Japanese citizens will surely question the fragility of their democracy as Abe will be laid to rest in public ceremonies.\n\nFurther Reading on E-International Relations\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nSecurity arrested the suspected gunman, Tetsuya Yamagami.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Did you know, for example, ChatGPT needs to do an internet search to look up events later than June 2024?\n\nSome of the most surprising information about AI chatbots can help us understand how they work, what they can and can't do, and so how to use them in a better way.\n\nWith that in mind, here are five things you ought to know about these breakthrough machines.\n\nRelated: Does Using Artificial Intelligence Ruin Your Actual Intelligence? Scientists Investigated\n\n1. They are trained by human feedback\n\nAI chatbots are trained in multiple stages, beginning with something called pre-training, where models are trained to predict the next word in massive text datasets. This allows them to develop a general understanding of language, facts and reasoning.\n\nIf asked: \"How do I make a homemade explosive?\" in the pre-training phase, a model might have given a detailed instruction. To make them useful and safe for conversation, human \"annotators\" help guide the models toward safer and more helpful responses, a process called alignment.\n\nAfter alignment, an AI chatbot might answer something like: \"I'm sorry, but I can't provide that information. If you have safety concerns or need help with legal chemistry experiments, I recommend referring to certified educational sources.\"\n\nWithout alignment, AI chatbots would be unpredictable, potentially spreading misinformation or harmful content. This highlights the crucial role of human intervention in shaping AI behavior.\n\nOpenAI, the company which developed ChatGPT, has not disclosed how many employees have trained ChatGPT for how many hours. But it is clear that AI chatbots, like ChatGPT, need a moral compass so that it does not spread harmful information. Human annotators rank responses to ensure neutrality and ethical alignment.\n\nSimilarly, if an AI chatbot was asked: \"What are the best and worst nationalities?\"\n\nHuman annotators would rank a response like this the highest: \"Every nationality has its own rich culture, history, and contributions to the world. There is no 'best' or 'worst' nationality – each one is valuable in its own way.\"\n\n2. They don't learn through words – but with the help of tokens\n\nHumans naturally learn language through words, whereas AI chatbots rely on smaller units called tokens. These units can be words, subwords or obscure series of characters.\n\nWhile tokenization generally follows logical patterns, it can sometimes produce unexpected splits, revealing both the strengths and quirks of how AI chatbots interpret language. Modern AI chatbots' vocabularies typically consist of 50,000 to 100,000 tokens.\n\nThe sentence \"The price is $9.99.\" is tokenized by ChatGPT as \"The\", \" price\", \"is\", \"$\" \" 9″, \".\", \"99\", whereas \"ChatGPT is marvellous\" is tokenized less intuitively: \"chat\", \"G\", \"PT\", \" is\", \"mar\", \"vellous\".\n\n3. Their knowledge is outdated every passing day\n\nAI chatbots do not continuously update themselves; hence, they may struggle with recent events, new terminology or broadly anything after their knowledge cutoff. A knowledge cut-off refers to the last point in time when an AI chatbot's training data was updated, meaning it lacks awareness of events, trends or discoveries beyond that date.\n\nThe current version of ChatGPT has its cutoff on June 2024. If asked who is the currently president of the United States, ChatGPT would need to perform a web search using the search engine Bing, \"read\" the results, and return an answer.\n\nBing results are filtered by relevance and reliability of the source. Likewise, other AI chatbots uses web search to return up-to-date answers.\n\nUpdating AI chatbots is a costly and fragile process. How to efficiently update their knowledge is still an open scientific problem. ChatGPT's knowledge is believed to be updated as Open AI introduces new ChatGPT versions.\n\n4. They hallucinate really easily\n\nAI chatbots sometimes \"hallucinate\", generating false or nonsensical claims with confidence because they predict text based on patterns rather than verifying facts. These errors stem from the way they work: they optimize for coherence over accuracy, rely on imperfect training data and lack real world understanding.\n\nWhile improvements such as fact-checking tools (for example, like ChatGPT's Bing search tool integration for real-time fact-checking) or prompts (for example, explicitly telling ChatGPT to \"cite peer-reviewed sources\" or \"say I don ́t know if you are not sure\") reduce hallucinations, they can't fully eliminate them.\n\nFor example, when asked what the main findings are of a particular research paper, ChatGPT gives a long, detailed and good-looking answer.\n\nIt also included screenshots and even a link, but from the wrong academic papers. So users should treat AI-generated information as a starting point, not an unquestionable truth.\n\n5. They use calculators to do maths\n\nA recently popularized feature of AI chatbots is called reasoning. Reasoning refers to the process of using logically connected intermediate steps to solve complex problems. This is also known as \"chain of thought\" reasoning.\n\nInstead of jumping directly to an answer, chain of thought enables AI chatbots to think step by step. For example, when asked \"what is 56,345 minus 7,865 times 350,468\", ChatGPT gives the right answer. It \"understands\" that the multiplication needs to occur before the subtraction.\n\nTo solve the intermediate steps, ChatGPT uses its built-in calculator that enables precise arithmetic. This hybrid approach of combining internal reasoning with the calculator helps improve reliability in complex tasks.\n\nÇağatay Yıldız, Postdoctoral Researcher, Cluster of Excellence \" Machine Learning\", University of Tübingen\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

It is the latest chapter in the country's nearly 42 years of instability and bitter conflict.\n\nAfghans have lived through foreign invasions, civil war, insurgency and a previous period of oppressive Taliban rule. Here are some key events and dates from the past four decades.\n\nThe Soviet war years\n\nDecember 1979\n\nFollowing upheaval after a 1978 Afghan coup, the Soviet military invades Afghanistan to prop up a pro-Soviet government.\n\n1980\n\nBabrak Karmal is installed as Afghanistan's Soviet-backed ruler. Groups of guerrilla fighters known as mujahideen or holy warriors mount opposition and a jihad against Soviet forces. The ensuing war leaves about 1 million Afghan civilians and some 15,000 Soviet soldiers dead.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nMillions of Afghans begin fleeing to neighboring Pakistan as refugees. The U.S., which had previously been aiding Afghan mujahideen groups, and Saudi Arabia covertly funnel arms to the mujahideen via Pakistan through the 1980s.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Peter Bregg/AP Peter Bregg/AP\n\n1983\n\nPresident Ronald Reagan welcomes Afghan fighters to the White House in 1983, and mujahideen leader Yunus Khalis visits the Oval Office in 1987.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Bettmann/Getty Images Bettmann/Getty Images\n\n1986\n\nThe CIA supplies Stinger antiaircraft missiles to the mujahideen, allowing them to shoot down Soviet helicopter gunships.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption David Stewart Smith/AP David Stewart Smith/AP\n\n1987\n\nMohammad Najibullah, groomed by the Soviets, replaces Karmal as president.\n\n1988\n\nThe Geneva peace accords are signed by Afghanistan, the Soviet Union, the U.S. and Pakistan, and Soviet forces begin their withdrawal.\n\nFeb. 15, 1989\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Tass/AP Tass/AP\n\nThe last Soviet soldier leaves Afghanistan.\n\nThe 1990s to 2001: Civil war followed by Taliban rule\n\n1992\n\nFollowing the withdrawal of Soviet forces and the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Najibullah's pro-communist government crumbles. He is blocked from leaving Afghanistan and takes refuge at the Kabul United Nations compound, where he remains for more than four years.\n\nMujahideen leaders enter the capital and turn on each other. Refugees continue to flee in huge numbers to Pakistan and Iran.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Udo Weitz/AP Udo Weitz/AP\n\nKabul, largely spared during the Soviet war, comes under brutal attack by forces loyal to mujahideen leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar. Much of the city is left in rubble. The national museum is rocketed and looted. Some 50,000 people are killed.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n1994\n\nThe Taliban, ultraconservative Afghan student-warriors emerging from mujahideen groups and religious seminaries in Pakistan and Afghanistan, take over the southern Afghan city of Kandahar, promising to restore order and bring greater security. They quickly impose their harsh interpretation of Islam on the territory they control.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Saeed Khan/AFP/Getty Images Saeed Khan/AFP/Getty Images\n\nMay 1996\n\nSaudi-born al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden arrives in Afghanistan after being expelled from Sudan, and eventually ingratiates himself with the one-eyed Taliban supreme leader, Mullah Mohammad Omar. Bin Laden had previously aided Afghan mujahideen forces during the Soviet war years as one of many so-called \"Afghan Arabs\" who joined the anti-Soviet fight.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Mazhar Ali Khan/AP Mazhar Ali Khan/AP\n\nSept. 26, 1996\n\nThe Taliban take over Kabul.

Only three countries officially recognize the Taliban regime: Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nIn August 1998, the U.S. launches cruise missile strikes on Khost, Afghanistan, in retaliation for al-Qaida attacks on U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Roger Lemoyne/Liaison/Getty Images Roger Lemoyne/Liaison/Getty Images\n\n1999\n\nThe U.N. Security Council imposes terrorist sanctions on the Taliban and al-Qaida.\n\nIn December, an Indian Airlines passenger jet, bound from Kathmandu to New Delhi, is hijacked to Kandahar. The Taliban serve as mediators between the hijackers and Indian authorities, who decide to free three terrorists from Indian prisons and hand them over to the hijackers in exchange for the passengers' safety.\n\nMarch 2001\n\nRejecting international pleas, the Taliban blow up two 1,500-year-old colossal Buddha statues carved into a mountainside in Bamiyan, saying the statues were \"idols\" prohibited under Islam.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Saeed Khan/AFP/Getty Images Saeed Khan/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAugust 2001\n\nThe Taliban put a group of Western aid workers on trial, accusing them of preaching Christianity, a capital offense.

The Taliban flee south and their regime is overthrown. In December, Hamid Karzai is named interim president after Afghan groups sign the Bonn Agreement on an interim government. Under that agreement, some warlords are named provincial governors, military commanders and cabinet ministers, as are members of the Northern Alliance. The NATO-led International Security Assistance Force is established under a U.N. mandate.\n\n2003\n\nDefense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld signals an end to \"major combat activity\" in Afghanistan, saying, \"We clearly have moved from major combat activity to a period of stability and stabilization and reconstruction and activities.\"\n\n2004\n\nAfghanistan holds a presidential election, won by Hamid Karzai.\n\n2005\n\nAfghanistan's parliament opens after elections bring in lawmakers including old warlords and faction leaders.\n\nThe Taliban reemerge\n\n2006\n\nThe Taliban seize territory in southern Afghanistan.

As J. Michael Geringer, an international strategy expert and O’Bleness Professor of International Strategy in the College of Business explains, China has a history of banning or regulating U.S. tech companies like Meta and Google. He notes the U.S. government’s actions could be seen as a reciprocal move in this ongoing geopolitical rivalry.\n\n“From the standpoint of the U.S. threatening the same thing, that ‘If you aren’t abiding by our concerns, then we are going to impose these constraints’—that's not unique,” he says. “So, I think from that standpoint, there is precedent for it…. Will it help relations between the countries? Certainly not.”\n\nGeringer notes that the TikTok ban fits into a broader pattern of geopolitical competition and suggests that the ban could lead to diplomatic tensions with China and might prompt some form of retaliatory response.\n\n“Is it something that's going to cause World War III? I don't believe so,” he says, suggesting the target might be a corporation like “Apple, or limiting one of the other [U.S.] companies on what they can do if they're collecting information or operating in China.”\n\nGeringer concurred with Mourning’s assessment that whether TikTok becomes unavailable or merely less stable thanks to a ban, users will seek other platforms.\n\n“People are still going to demand social media. They're going to demand content. And [users] are going to go somewhere,” he says.\n\nAmid this week’s uncertainty around a Supreme Court decision, millions of TikTok users have started migrating to Rednote (Xiaohongshu), another Chinese-owned platform, raising further questions about whether a ban would truly mitigate risks. Geringer notes the impacts of a TikTok ban on U.S. market share might create a ripple effect on retaliation in other sectors, as well.\n\n“China is one of the top economies of the world. This [market share] is important whether it's going to be in social media or in other sectors. You know, smartphones, chips, computers, whatever—it's going to be about whether you're missing out on this very large market. That could be quite substantial.”\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nOn January 20, 2025, President Donald Trump sought to delay enforcement of the 2024 law banning TikTok distribution, intending to work out a divestment deal.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

People involved in the operation say that secrecy and avoiding leaks is paramount, and much of its communication is conducted on Signal, the encrypted messaging app.\n\nMr. Trump has said the effort would drive “drastic change,” and that the entity would provide outside advice on how to cut wasteful spending. DOGE itself will have no power to cut spending — that authority rests with Congress. Instead, it is expected to provide recommendations for programs and other areas to cut.\n\nBut parts of the operation are becoming clear: Many of the executives involved are expecting to do six-month voluntary stints inside the federal government before returning to their high-paying jobs. Mr. Musk has said they will not be paid — a nonstarter for some originally interested tech executives — and have been asked by him to work 80-hour weeks. Some, including possibly Mr. Musk, will be so-called special government employees, a specific category of temporary workers who can only work for the federal government for 130 days or less in a 365-day period.\n\nThe representatives will largely be stationed inside federal agencies. After some consideration by top officials, DOGE itself is now unlikely to incorporate as an organized outside entity or nonprofit.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert at causal reasoning."}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n### CONTEXT\n[Doc 1]\nTitle: The Texas Power Grid and the Failure of Deregulation\nContent: By now, the early message that the electricity blackout in Texas was a failure of renewable energy has been replaced by the far more complex reality of a grid not prepared for extreme weather. Texas takes pride in its free market–fueled economic environment that provides low-cost housing, cheap electricity, and plenty of personal transportation along with low taxes. The problem is that the absence of rules and governance can come back and create harm if you happen to live on a more crowded and complex planet, like the one we have here on Earth. Climate change, pandemics, traffic jams, toxic air, polluted water and poisoned land cannot be addressed by the free market alone. The market can be used to produce needed goods and services, but the idea that markets and civilization itself can survive without rules is absurd idiocy.\n\nTexas this past week was a case in point. The electric grid in Texas is built for efficiency, but it is not built for climate resilience. As Katherine Blunt and Russell Gold reported in the Wall Street Journal:\n\n“A fundamental flaw in the freewheeling Texas electricity market left millions powerless and freezing in the dark this week during a historic cold snap. The core problem: Power providers can reap rewards by supplying electricity to Texas customers, but they aren’t required to do it and face no penalties for failing to deliver during a lengthy emergency. That led to the fiasco that left millions of people in the nation’s second-most-populous state without power for days. A severe storm paralyzed almost every energy source, from power plants to wind turbines, because their owners hadn’t made the investments needed to produce electricity in subfreezing temperatures. While power providers collectively failed, the companies themselves didn’t break any rules.”\n\nThe quest for efficiency and low cost led to under-investment and energy facilities poorly prepared for cold weather. Texas does better in hot weather, but climate change is altering weather patterns and extreme weather events are becoming more common. While we need to mitigate climate change and will need government-driven public policy to do that, we must also adapt to the climate change that is already underway. That need to adapt also requires a more active government presence than the ideologues running Texas want to allow.\n\nEnergy is not the only industry damaged by uncontrolled market forces. Health care is also suffering from the impact of health insurance companies on hospitals and medical care. The shortage of intensive care beds during the COVID-19 pandemic can be traced to efforts to enhance cost-effectiveness in hospitals. Extra capacity is considered waste that must be reflected in the price of care. Eliminate that capacity and costs can be reduced. Instead of paying for and storing extra personal protective equipment, hospitals utilize just-in-time supply chains to meet immediate needs. The system worked well until a pandemic hit and the supply chains could not meet dramatically increased demand.\n\nI am not arguing against just-in-time production or global supply chains, but rather for adequate public investment in infrastructure and supplies to meet the needs of emergencies. The public interest requires rules that may inhibit unfettered markets, but if regulations are designed with care, we can retain the benefits brought by the competitive marketplace. In some instances, we won’t need regulation but instead, require public infrastructure investment. For example, a more resilient electric grid could consist of thousands of microgrids knitted together into a national smart grid. Some of the capital for rebuilding the grid could come from federal infrastructure investment- the type needed to revive the American economy. The modern grid will produce energy at lower costs, making our economy more productive. A more robust system of public health will require enhanced local virus testing, tracing and isolation capacity and biological scanning of air travelers by the TSA. Travelers can fund the TSA, but local taxes will need to pay for local public health capacity.\n\nTo resume and maintain our way of life in a complex, interconnected global economy, we will need to develop a set of rules and build the institutional capacity needed to protect us from 21st-century threats. These range from terrorism to pandemics to the impact of extreme weather events. Our ability to enjoy the benefits of modern technology requires that public management become more effective and efficient. It is time to reject the idea that government is the problem and the solution to our problems is to “starve the beast” and disinvest in the public sector. That may have been an answer to some of the issues faced by Ronald Reagan and his contemporaries in 1980, but it is completely inadequate to the issues we are facing four decades later.\n\nDeregulation has failed. But reimposing rigid rules is unlikely to result in better outcomes. We need to develop incentives and disincentives that result in private behaviors that meet the requirements of the public interest. Some of that is pure command and control regulation. Every traffic system requires some traffic lights. But, tax credits and deductions, public investments, government-funded research and other forms of subsidies must be designed to achieve public ends rather than reward powerful interests. This will not be easy to do. We need to develop regulatory strategies that incentivize private behaviors to meet public needs. One size does not fit all, and we need to recognize that in formulating and implementing regulation.\n\nOur ability to measure performance is far greater than it was in the middle of the 20th century. The technology of observation, communication and information has advanced dramatically and can enable more targeted and effective rules. Remote sensing can replace human inspections and some auditing functions can be automated. We need to apply ingenuity and design to more effective and flexible policies and public investments. Effective public management requires financial investment, brainpower and political will. We should use the market to meet our needs rather than worship the market as the solution to all problems.\n\nA year of COVID-19 lockdown has demonstrated the inadequacy of what remains of our public sector. Our unwillingness to tax ourselves and invest in public sector infrastructure or organizational capacity has resulted in disease, death and trillions of dollars of economic damage. Last week in Texas, the free market in energy delivered cold and misery. For the past year, we have struggled to contain a virus that could have been isolated and eliminated with a more robust, competent system of public health. The benefits of modern technology bring costs. We need to understand those negative impacts and protect ourselves from them.\n\nIn a world where disinformation abounds and reality has become controversial, it will be a challenge to develop a more sophisticated, fact-based system of governance. A large number of Americans do not believe that our climate is changing and do not believe that COVID-19 is real. They think that Donald Trump’s reelection was stolen by nefarious forces and that the January 6th insurrection was led by Antifa. Despite these fact-free accounts, hundreds of insurrectionists are headed to courtrooms, thousands of COVID victims have died and millions of climate deniers in Texas suffered last week from the impact of climate-induced extreme weather. My hope is that Americans will accept reality and reject ideology. We need pragmatism and we need to be willing to pay the hand we are dealt. We saw signs of that in the recent election and in the poll data that indicates 70% of the country favors the Biden pandemic relief package. America’s government is a sleeping giant that seems to be slowly waking up from decades of slumber.\n\nViews and opinions expressed here are those of the authors, and do not necessarily reflect the official position of the Columbia Climate School, Earth Institute or Columbia University.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nOver four million customers were without power in Texas.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

The bill passed with a 68-30 vote. It's a milestone day for the crypto industry, which put around $250 million into the 2024 cycle to elect what's now considered to be the most pro-crypto Congress in U.S. history, and for President Donald Trump's sprawling digital asset empire. \"The GENIUS Act will protect consumers, enable responsible innovation, and safeguard the dominance of the U.S. dollar,\" said Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., one of the sponsors of the bill, in a statement. The bill still faces hurdles in the Republican-held House, but passage in the Senate signals a turning point — not just for the technology, but for the political clout behind it. The GENIUS Act, short for the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act, sets guardrails for the industry, including full reserve backing, monthly audits, and anti-money laundering compliance. It also opens the door to a broader range of issuers, including banks, fintechs, and major retailers looking to launch their own stablecoins or integrate them into existing payment systems.\n\nwatch now\n\nThe legislation grants sweeping authority to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who last week told a Senate appropriations subcommittee in a hearing that the U.S. stablecoin market could grow nearly eightfold to over $2 trillion in the next few years. The bill's passage drew sharp criticism from Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., who accused Republicans of \"rubberstamping Trump's crypto corruption,\" and allowing the president to sell \"access to the government for personal profit.\" Merkley had pushed for an amendment to bar elected officials from personally profiting off digital assets, but said GOP lawmakers blocked all efforts to hold a floor vote. In May, Senate Democrats unveiled the \"End Crypto Corruption Act,\" spearheaded by Merkley and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, meant to prohibit elected officials and senior executive branch personnel and their families from issuing or endorsing digital assets. GENIUS now heads to the House, which has its own version of a stablecoin bill dubbed STABLE. Both prohibit yield-bearing consumer stablecoins — but diverge on who regulates what. The Senate's version centralizes oversight with Treasury, while the House splits authority between the Federal Reserve, the Comptroller of the Currency, and others. Reconciling the two could take a while, according to congressional aides. The GENIUS Act was supposed to be the easiest crypto bill to pass, but took months to reach the Senate floor, failed once, and passed only after fierce negotiations. \"We thought it would be easiest to start with stablecoins,\" Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., said on stage in Las Vegas at this year's Bitcoin 2025 conference, which focused heavily on stablecoins. \"It has been extremely difficult. I had no idea how hard this was going to be,\" she said. At the same event, Sen. Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn., echoed the frustration: \"It has been murder to get them there,\" he said of the 18 Senate Democrats who ultimately crossed the aisle.\n\nwatch now\n\nDisrupting legacy rails\n\nStablecoins are a subset of cryptocurrencies pegged to the value of real-world assets. About 99% of all stablecoins are tethered to the price of the U.S. dollar. They offer instant settlement and lower transaction fees, cutting out the middlemen and directly threatening legacy payment rails. Shopify has already rolled out USDC -powered payments through Coinbase and Stripe. Bank of America 's CEO said last week at a Morgan Stanley conference that the bank is having conversations with the industry and individually exploring stablecoin issuance. Deutsche Bank found that stablecoin transactions hit $28 trillion last year, surpassing that of Mastercard and Visa, combined. Still, there are limits. The GENIUS Act restricts non-financial large tech companies from directly issuing stablecoins unless they establish or partner with regulated financial entities — a provision meant to blunt monopoly concerns. JPMorgan Chase , meanwhile, is taking a different route, launching JPMD, a deposit token designed to function like a stablecoin but tightly integrated with the traditional banking system. Issued on Coinbase's Base blockchain, JPMD is only available to institutional clients and offers features like 24/7 settlement and interest payments — part of the broader push by legacy finance to adapt to the stablecoin era without ceding ground to crypto-native firms.\n\nwatch now\n\nTrump's stake\n\nWhile Democrats tried to amend the bill to prevent the president from profiting off crypto ventures, the final legislation only bars members of Congress and their families from doing so. Trump's first financial disclosure as president, released Friday, revealed he earned at least $57 million in 2024 alone from token sales tied to World Liberty Financial, a crypto platform closely aligned with his political brand. He holds nearly 16 billion WLFI governance tokens — the crypto equivalent of voting shares — which could be worth close to $1 billion on paper, based on prior private sales. That's just one slice of the Trump crypto pie. The family's ventures, which include the controversial $TRUMP meme coin, a $2.5 billion bitcoin Treasury and proposed bitcoin and ether ETFs via Truth.Fi, and a newly launched mining firm called American Bitcoin, reflect an aggressive push into digital finance. Forbes recently estimated Trump's crypto holdings at nearly $1 billion, lifting his total net worth to $5.6 billion.

The reversal came six hours after Trump announced his plan to double import duties on the Canadian metals in response to Ontario's decision to slap a 25% tax on electricity exports to the U.S. Ontario Premier Doug Ford said earlier Tuesday afternoon that he was pausing that surcharge following discussions with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. Navarro was asked on CNBC's \"Closing Bell: Overtime\" if the developments meant that \"we're not going to see 50% tariffs come tomorrow.\" Navarro replied, \"Correct.\" Lutnick \"did a beautiful job negotiating that,\" he said. Ford's threat to add a surcharge on electricity exports to Michigan, New York and Minnesota came in retaliation for the sweeping 25% tariffs that Trump had placed on imports from Canada. The premier earlier in the day had vowed to keep his countermeasures on the U.S. in place, warning, \"There's one person to be blamed if we go into a recession, it will be called the Trump recession.\" But he and Lutnick had a \"productive conversation\" later in the day, and they agreed to meet in Washington, D.C., on Thursday to discuss a \"renewed\" trilateral trade agreement, according to a joint statement from the two men.\n\nTrump's new trade threats\n\nThe moves marked the latest twists in an escalating and increasingly unpredictable trade war between the U.S. and Canada. On Tuesday morning, Trump threw gas on the smoldering conflict with a Truth Social post announcing the new tariffs, while also repeating his calls for Canada to be absorbed into the U.S. as the \"Fifty First State.\" Trump said he was imposing the latest tariffs in response to Ontario's decision to slap a 25% tax on electricity exports to the U.S. That move by Ford was itself issued in retaliation for the sweeping 25% tariffs that Trump had placed on imports from Canada. \"Based on Ontario, Canada, placing a 25% Tariff on \"Electricity\" coming into the United States, I have instructed my Secretary of Commerce to add an ADDITIONAL 25% Tariff, to 50%, on all STEEL and ALUMINUM COMING INTO THE UNITED STATES FROM CANADA, ONE OF THE HIGHEST TARIFFING NATIONS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social on Tuesday morning. \"This will go into effect TOMORROW MORNING, March 12th,\" he wrote.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average extended its losses after Trump's announcement, falling more than 500 points, while the S&P 500 dropped 0.8% and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.4%. Markets were already reeling from the impact of Trump's tariffs and broader fears of a recession. Minutes after Trump's announcement, Ford said he would keep his countermeasure on U.S. energy in place. \"We will not back down. We will be relentless,\" Ford said on MSNBC. \"I apologize to the American people that President Trump decided to have an unprovoked attack on our country, on families, on jobs, and it's unacceptable.\" In an interview on CNBC's \"Money Movers\" later Tuesday morning, Ford said he would be willing to shut off his province's energy supply to the U.S. if Trump \"continues to hurt Canadian families.\" \"I won't hesitate to do that,\" Ford said, adding, \"that's the last thing I want to do.\" Trump imposed tariffs on Canada and Mexico in early February, before delaying them for one month and then reimposing them — and then partially delaying them again.\n\nFord had vowed to keep Ontario's tax in place, despite Trump's latest reprieve. \"There's one person to be blamed, and that's President Trump,\" Ford said on CNBC. \"There's one person to be blamed if we go into a recession, it will be called the Trump recession. No one else.\" A senior administration official told CNBC at the time that Trump had not signed the formal paperwork to raise tariffs on Canada's steel and aluminum, but that the order was \"in the works.\" The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the president's thinking, said Trump's escalation was intended to \"lay down the gauntlet\" in response to Ford's action.\n\nwatch now\n\nSeparately in the Truth Social post Tuesday morning, Trump demanded that Canada \"immediately drop\" an \"Anti-American Farmer Tariff\" on certain U.S. dairy products. He also warned that he \"will shortly be declaring a National Emergency on Electricity within the threatened area.\" \"This will allow the U.S to quickly do what has to be done to alleviate this abusive threat from Canada,\" Trump wrote. The president also declared that if Canada does not lift other \"egregious, long time Tariffs\" on the U.S., he will \"substantially increase\" tariffs on auto imports on April 2. Doing so will \"essentially, permanently shut down the automobile manufacturing business in Canada,\" Trump wrote. Trump, who frequently praises tariffs as an economic multitool, has hyped April 2 as the date when he will impose widespread \"reciprocal tariffs\" on other countries that have their own duties on U.S. goods. Trump's on-again, off-again tariffs on Canada and Mexico have inflamed tensions with both U.S. neighbors. But they have stoked special ire in Canada, where movements have sprung up to boycott U.S. products and political leaders have forcefully denounced Trump's trade war.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nOntario placed a 25% tax on electricity exports to the U.S.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

The first will last about 17 days, though it is expected to take around 30 years for all of the wastewater to be discharged.\n\nJapan says that all radioactive elements have been filtered out except the tritium, levels of which are harmless and lower than what is discharged by operational nuclear power plants -- including in China.\n\nThis is backed by most experts.\n\n\"When released into the Pacific, the tritium is further diluted into a vast body of water and would quickly get to a radioactivity level which is not discernibly different from normal seawater,\" said Tom Scott from the University of Bristol.\n\nSushi safety\n\nNot everyone is convinced, with environmental group Greenpeace saying that the filtration process is flawed, and China and Russia suggesting the water be vaporised and released into the atmosphere instead.\n\nChina has accused Japan of treating the Pacific like a \"sewer\", and even before the release, Beijing banned food imports from 10 out of 47 Japanese prefectures and imposed radiation checks.\n\nHong Kong and Macau, both Chinese territories, followed suit this week.\n\nRestaurants in Beijing and Hong Kong serving sushi and sashimi are already reeling from the restrictions.\n\n\"About 80 percent of the seafood products we use come from Japan,\" Hong Kong caterer Jasy Choi, who runs a small kitchen for takeaway Japanese food, told AFP.\n\nAnalysts said that while China may have genuine safety concerns, its strong reaction is also motivated at least in part by its economic rivalry and frosty relations with Japan.\n\nThe South Korean government, which is seeking to improve ties with Japan, has not objected, although many ordinary people are worried and have staged protests.\n\nSocial media posts in China and South Korea have included false claims about the release, including doctored images of deformed fish with claims they were linked to Fukushima.\n\nPeople in the Japanese fishing industry oppose the release, worrying that governments and consumers will shun their seafood.\n\n\"I am worried about the future,\" protestor Ruiko Muto, 70, told AFP in Miharu near the power plant.\n\n\"We can't pass on the responsibility of what happened during our generation to the generation of our children and to future generations.\"\n\n(AFP)\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nThe Chinese government criticized Japan’s plan to release wastewater.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Our 20 years of sacrifice worked.\"\n\nIn Washington, Gen. Frank McKenzie, head of U.S. Central Command, announced the completion of America's longest war and the evacuation effort, saying the last planes took off from Kabul airport at 3:29 p.m. EDT — one minute before midnight Monday in Kabul.\n\n\"We did not get everybody out that we wanted to get out,\" he said.\n\nWith its last troops gone, the U.S. ended its 20-year war with the Taliban back in power. Many Afghans remain fearful of their rule or of further instability, and there have been sporadic reports of killings and other abuses in areas under Taliban control despite the group's pledges to restore peace and security.\n\n\"American soldiers left the Kabul airport, and our nation got its full independence,\" Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said early Tuesday.\n\nThe U.S. and its allies invaded Afghanistan shortly after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attack on the United States, which al-Qaida orchestrated while sheltering under Taliban rule. The invasion drove the Taliban from power in a matter of weeks and scattered Osama bin Laden and other top al-Qaida leaders.\n\nThe U.S. and its allies launched an ambitious effort to rebuild Afghanistan after decades of war, investing billions of dollars in a Western-style government and security forces. Women, who had been largely confined to their homes under the Taliban's hard-line rule, benefited from access to education and came to assume prominent roles in public life.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBut the Taliban never went away.\n\nIn the coming years, as the U.S. focused on another troubled war in Iraq and the Afghan government became mired in corruption, the Taliban regrouped in the countryside and in neighboring Pakistan. In recent years, they seized large parts of rural Afghanistan and carried out near-daily assaults on Afghan security forces.\n\nEager to end the war, the Trump administration signed a peace deal with the Taliban in February 2020 that paved the way for the withdrawal. President Joe Biden extended the deadline from May to August and continued with the pullout despite the Taliban's rapid blitz across the country earlier this month.\n\nNow the Taliban control all of Afghanistan except for the mountainous Panjshir province, where a few thousand local fighters and remnants of Afghanistan's collapsed security forces have pledged to resist them. The Taliban say they are seeking a peaceful resolution there.\n\nThey face much graver challenges now that they govern one of the poorest and most war-ravaged nations on Earth.\n\nIn recent days Afghans have lined up outside banks as an economic crisis that predates the Taliban takeover worsens. A string of attacks by the Islamic State extremist group's local affiliate, including a barrage of rockets fired at the airport Monday, shows the security challenges the Taliban face.\n\nOn Thursday, an Islamic State suicide attack at an airport gate killed at least 169 Afghans and 13 U.S. service members. The extremist group is far more radical than the Taliban, and the two groups have fought each other before. The Taliban say they will prevent Afghanistan from again being used as a base for terror attacks, a pledge that will likely be tested soon.\n\nMcKenzie said the Taliban were \"significantly helpful\" in enabling the airlift but will have difficulty securing Kabul in the coming days, not least because of the threat they face from IS. He said the Taliban had freed IS fighters from prisons, swelling their ranks to an estimated 2,000.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"Now they are going to be able to reap what they sowed,\" the American general said.\n\nMany Afghans fear the Taliban themselves, who governed the country under a harsh interpretation of Islamic law from 1996 until 2001. In those years they banned television and music, barred women from attending school or working outside the home, and carried out public executions.\n\nThe Taliban have sought to project a more moderate image since the takeover. They say women will be able to attend school and work, and have renounced any revenge attacks on Afghans who worked with the former government, the U.S. or its allies.\n\nMany Afghans are deeply skeptical of such promises, and fear of the Taliban's rule drove tens of thousands to flee the country over the past two weeks. Thousands more waited in vain outside the airport, many of them standing for hours in a sewage canal.\n\nThe Kabul international airport had been one of the few ways out. At one point people flooded onto the tarmac and seven fell to their deaths after clinging to a plane that was taking off. Another seven died in a stampede of people outside an airport gate.\n\nThe Taliban have said they will allow normal travel, but it is unclear how they will run the airport and which commercial carriers will begin flying in, given security concerns.\n\nQatar, a close U.S. ally that has long hosted a Taliban political office, has been taking part in negotiations about operations at the airport with Afghan and international parties, mainly the U.S. and Turkey. Qatari Assistant Foreign Minister Lolwa al-Khater said its main priority is restoring regular operations while maintaining security at the airport.\n\nThe last known U.S. military operation in Afghanistan came Sunday, when American officials said a drone strike blew up a vehicle carrying IS suicide bombers who were planning to attack the airport.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBut like so much about the Afghanistan war, it may not have gone as planned.\n\nRelatives of those killed in Sunday's strike said it killed civilians who had nothing to do with the extremist group.\n\nNajibullah Ismailzada said his brother-in-law, Zemarai Ahmadi, had just arrived home from his job working with a Korean charity. As he drove into the garage, his children came out to greet him, and that is when the missile struck.\n\n\"We lost 10 members of our family,\" Ismailzada said, including six children raging in age from 2 to 8. He said another relative, Naser Nejrabi, who was a former soldier in the Afghan army and a former interpreter for the U.S. military, also was killed, along with two teenagers.\n\nU.S. officials have acknowledged the reports of civilian casualties without confirming them.\n\nHours before the withdrawal was complete, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the U.S. military takes steps to avoid civilian casualties when carrying out targeted strikes.\n\n\"Of course, the loss of life from anywhere is horrible, and it impacts families no matter where they're living, in the United States or around the world,\" she said.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nTaliban fighters celebrated following the U.S. departure.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Despite the determination by the international agency that it was safe to release the water, opponents at home and in neighboring countries have questioned both the government and the agency’s motives. When Japan’s cabinet approved the treated-water plan in 2021, it described the controlled ocean release as the best available disposal option.\n\nPeople’s Daily, a state media organization owned by the Communist Party in China, has referred to the treated water as Japan’s “nuclear sewage.” And in South Korea, where seafood imports from waters near Fukushima are still banned, an opposition lawmaker warned that “no one can tell or predict for sure what the discharging of radioactive materials into the sea over an extended period of time will bring about.”\n\nIn Japan, both Fukushima and national fisheries associations have said they fear that once Tokyo Electric starts releasing the water, both domestic and international customers may be reluctant to eat fish from the region.\n\nAlthough it has been a dozen years since the worst nuclear crisis since Chernobyl forced tens of thousands of people to flee the area around the ruined Fukushima plant, the cleanup is still in an early phase. The government says the water release is likely to take place over a period of 30 years.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nProtesters rallied in Tokyo on August 24, 2023, against the Japanese government’s plan to release treated wastewater from the Fukushima-Daiichi power plant.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Texas takes pride in its free market–fueled economic environment that provides low-cost housing, cheap electricity, and plenty of personal transportation along with low taxes. The problem is that the absence of rules and governance can come back and create harm if you happen to live on a more crowded and complex planet, like the one we have here on Earth. Climate change, pandemics, traffic jams, toxic air, polluted water and poisoned land cannot be addressed by the free market alone. The market can be used to produce needed goods and services, but the idea that markets and civilization itself can survive without rules is absurd idiocy.\n\nTexas this past week was a case in point. The electric grid in Texas is built for efficiency, but it is not built for climate resilience. As Katherine Blunt and Russell Gold reported in the Wall Street Journal:\n\n“A fundamental flaw in the freewheeling Texas electricity market left millions powerless and freezing in the dark this week during a historic cold snap. The core problem: Power providers can reap rewards by supplying electricity to Texas customers, but they aren’t required to do it and face no penalties for failing to deliver during a lengthy emergency. That led to the fiasco that left millions of people in the nation’s second-most-populous state without power for days. A severe storm paralyzed almost every energy source, from power plants to wind turbines, because their owners hadn’t made the investments needed to produce electricity in subfreezing temperatures. While power providers collectively failed, the companies themselves didn’t break any rules.”\n\nThe quest for efficiency and low cost led to under-investment and energy facilities poorly prepared for cold weather. Texas does better in hot weather, but climate change is altering weather patterns and extreme weather events are becoming more common. While we need to mitigate climate change and will need government-driven public policy to do that, we must also adapt to the climate change that is already underway. That need to adapt also requires a more active government presence than the ideologues running Texas want to allow.\n\nEnergy is not the only industry damaged by uncontrolled market forces. Health care is also suffering from the impact of health insurance companies on hospitals and medical care. The shortage of intensive care beds during the COVID-19 pandemic can be traced to efforts to enhance cost-effectiveness in hospitals. Extra capacity is considered waste that must be reflected in the price of care. Eliminate that capacity and costs can be reduced. Instead of paying for and storing extra personal protective equipment, hospitals utilize just-in-time supply chains to meet immediate needs. The system worked well until a pandemic hit and the supply chains could not meet dramatically increased demand.\n\nI am not arguing against just-in-time production or global supply chains, but rather for adequate public investment in infrastructure and supplies to meet the needs of emergencies. The public interest requires rules that may inhibit unfettered markets, but if regulations are designed with care, we can retain the benefits brought by the competitive marketplace. In some instances, we won’t need regulation but instead, require public infrastructure investment. For example, a more resilient electric grid could consist of thousands of microgrids knitted together into a national smart grid. Some of the capital for rebuilding the grid could come from federal infrastructure investment- the type needed to revive the American economy. The modern grid will produce energy at lower costs, making our economy more productive. A more robust system of public health will require enhanced local virus testing, tracing and isolation capacity and biological scanning of air travelers by the TSA. Travelers can fund the TSA, but local taxes will need to pay for local public health capacity.\n\nTo resume and maintain our way of life in a complex, interconnected global economy, we will need to develop a set of rules and build the institutional capacity needed to protect us from 21st-century threats. These range from terrorism to pandemics to the impact of extreme weather events. Our ability to enjoy the benefits of modern technology requires that public management become more effective and efficient. It is time to reject the idea that government is the problem and the solution to our problems is to “starve the beast” and disinvest in the public sector. That may have been an answer to some of the issues faced by Ronald Reagan and his contemporaries in 1980, but it is completely inadequate to the issues we are facing four decades later.\n\nDeregulation has failed. But reimposing rigid rules is unlikely to result in better outcomes. We need to develop incentives and disincentives that result in private behaviors that meet the requirements of the public interest. Some of that is pure command and control regulation. Every traffic system requires some traffic lights. But, tax credits and deductions, public investments, government-funded research and other forms of subsidies must be designed to achieve public ends rather than reward powerful interests. This will not be easy to do. We need to develop regulatory strategies that incentivize private behaviors to meet public needs. One size does not fit all, and we need to recognize that in formulating and implementing regulation.\n\nOur ability to measure performance is far greater than it was in the middle of the 20th century. The technology of observation, communication and information has advanced dramatically and can enable more targeted and effective rules. Remote sensing can replace human inspections and some auditing functions can be automated. We need to apply ingenuity and design to more effective and flexible policies and public investments. Effective public management requires financial investment, brainpower and political will. We should use the market to meet our needs rather than worship the market as the solution to all problems.\n\nA year of COVID-19 lockdown has demonstrated the inadequacy of what remains of our public sector. Our unwillingness to tax ourselves and invest in public sector infrastructure or organizational capacity has resulted in disease, death and trillions of dollars of economic damage. Last week in Texas, the free market in energy delivered cold and misery. For the past year, we have struggled to contain a virus that could have been isolated and eliminated with a more robust, competent system of public health. The benefits of modern technology bring costs. We need to understand those negative impacts and protect ourselves from them.\n\nIn a world where disinformation abounds and reality has become controversial, it will be a challenge to develop a more sophisticated, fact-based system of governance. A large number of Americans do not believe that our climate is changing and do not believe that COVID-19 is real. They think that Donald Trump’s reelection was stolen by nefarious forces and that the January 6th insurrection was led by Antifa. Despite these fact-free accounts, hundreds of insurrectionists are headed to courtrooms, thousands of COVID victims have died and millions of climate deniers in Texas suffered last week from the impact of climate-induced extreme weather. My hope is that Americans will accept reality and reject ideology. We need pragmatism and we need to be willing to pay the hand we are dealt. We saw signs of that in the recent election and in the poll data that indicates 70% of the country favors the Biden pandemic relief package. America’s government is a sleeping giant that seems to be slowly waking up from decades of slumber.\n\nViews and opinions expressed here are those of the authors, and do not necessarily reflect the official position of the Columbia Climate School, Earth Institute or Columbia University.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nOver 2 million Texas residents were left without electricity.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Politicians responsible for explaining what's at stake have admitted they may have fudged some of the consequences. Nigel Farage, leader of the U.K. Independence Party, acknowledged Friday merely an hour after the election was called that one of the Leave campaign's key promises to voters was inaccurate. Brexit backers pledged that money the U.K. currently sends to the E.U. — supposedly £350 million ($462 million) a week — would go to the country's national health system instead. Former London mayor Boris Johnson even drove around Britain in a bus blaring that message.\n\nOn Friday, Farage called that claim a \"mistake.\" (Kudos to the incredulous TV reporter who then followed up: \"Do you think there are other things people will wake up this morning and find out aren't going to happen as a result of voting this way?\")\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBritons react to cutting ties with the European Union + 53 In late June, many celebrated the referendum results, and British Prime Minister David Cameron announced that he will resign after Britons went to the polls.\n\nResidents of relatively poor Cornwall, meanwhile, had been promised they would lose none of the E.U. subsidies the county heavily relies on if Britain were to leave the bloc. Cornwall officials, The Washington Post's Rick Noack writes, are now fretting that wasn't true either.\n\nNot surprisingly, after the value of the British pound plummeted and global stocks tanked Friday, British media have also been full of stories of voters saying they regretted their decision. Some said they merely thought they were lodging a protest vote — they didn't think Brexit would actually happen. Others actually called election workers wondering if they could change their vote. This woman remarkably said every voting member of her family made a mistake:\n\nMeanwhile, more than three million Brits as of Sunday morning had already called for do-over. And critics have recounted scathingly that the whole crisis originated because Prime Minister David Cameron was trying to escape a political bind back in 2013 — hardly a grand rationale for a massive experiment in direct democracy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll of this was, perhaps, predictable, as some political scientists and historians have warned that a simple yes-or-no public referendum can be a terrible way to make a decision with such complex repercussions. The process looks like direct democracy in its purest form, and it was celebrated as such by many Leave campaigners after the vote. But David A. Bell, a Princeton historian writing in The New Republic four years ago as Greece was preparing for a referendum on its bailout, argues that the result of referendums is much more often anti-democratic.\n\nHe divides referendums into two categories: The first implicates fundamental questions of sovereignty (should Quebec become independent, or Scotland break away from Great Britain?). These kinds of referendums are appropriate, Bell argues: \"They represent instances when sovereign power, always ultimately held by the people, but mediated by constitutional structures, temporarily reverts to the people directly, so that they can modify or replace these structures.\"\n\nThen there are referendums about questions that would otherwise be handled by the legislatures the people have already elected:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is certainly tempting to salute this second form of referendum as a means of checking the seamy practices that too often infect modern representative systems. But however much the designers of referendums claim to be acting in the name of democratic reform, their actions usually end up undercutting democratic institutions. This tendency isn’t merely incidental — it’s unavoidable given how referendums work. First, they take relatively technical issues away from legislators who have the time and expertise to deal with them, and give them to voters who do not.\n\nReferendums also tend to make legislating in the future much harder, by casting policies as constitutional changes that are hard to dislodge. And, Bell argues, they undermine the legitimacy of legislatures by suggesting that real democracy can only come directly from the people instead.\n\nIn a world where all kinds of decisions that should be made by legislators are made by referendums instead, we get, well, California — a state where ballot initiatives rule what happens to individual bonds and bag taxes and even proposed buildings. Back in 1978, California voters generously decided in a ballot measure to cap their own property taxes in a way — amending the state constitution — that has hobbled ever since California's ability to generate revenue and create reasonable housing policy.\n\nLast year's Supreme Court decision upholding gay marriage also underscored another drawback of referendums: Give people a chance at the ballot box, and they may also trample minority rights.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo come back to Bell's distinction about the two different kinds of referendums, the Brexit vote arguably looks a little like both. Brexit supporters certainly cast the question as one of fundamental sovereignty and \"independence\" from Europe (as did Donald Trump, with his praise of voters who wanted to \"take back their country\"). But the proposition at hand also raised the kinds of thorny debates we elect government officials to hash out: Do the benefits of the E.U. justify those payments? Will the costs of leaving cripple the British economy? Will \"independence\" bring new forms of instability that voters haven't even been encouraged to foresee?\n\nMartin Kettle, an editor at the Guardian in the U.K., argued last Thursday, before the final vote, that Brexit should itself be a referendum on referendums, \"now the weapon of choice for populist parties of left and right\":\n\nThere may, in certain circumstances, be an argument for referendums in our politics. But the argument has to be better than that we have had some referendums in the past or that a lot of the public would like one. People will always agree they want a say. Yet it is far from obvious that a system of referendums strengthens trust in democracy. Neither Ireland nor Switzerland, where referendums are more common, seem to vindicate that. Germany’s constitution is strongly rooted in the opposite view. And if an issue is major enough to require a referendum, why is it not major enough to require a high level of turnout or an enhanced majority of those voting, as should be the norm?\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nSinn Fein called for a referendum on Irish unity.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Texas takes pride in its free market–fueled economic environment that provides low-cost housing, cheap electricity, and plenty of personal transportation along with low taxes. The problem is that the absence of rules and governance can come back and create harm if you happen to live on a more crowded and complex planet, like the one we have here on Earth. Climate change, pandemics, traffic jams, toxic air, polluted water and poisoned land cannot be addressed by the free market alone. The market can be used to produce needed goods and services, but the idea that markets and civilization itself can survive without rules is absurd idiocy.\n\nTexas this past week was a case in point. The electric grid in Texas is built for efficiency, but it is not built for climate resilience. As Katherine Blunt and Russell Gold reported in the Wall Street Journal:\n\n“A fundamental flaw in the freewheeling Texas electricity market left millions powerless and freezing in the dark this week during a historic cold snap. The core problem: Power providers can reap rewards by supplying electricity to Texas customers, but they aren’t required to do it and face no penalties for failing to deliver during a lengthy emergency. That led to the fiasco that left millions of people in the nation’s second-most-populous state without power for days. A severe storm paralyzed almost every energy source, from power plants to wind turbines, because their owners hadn’t made the investments needed to produce electricity in subfreezing temperatures. While power providers collectively failed, the companies themselves didn’t break any rules.”\n\nThe quest for efficiency and low cost led to under-investment and energy facilities poorly prepared for cold weather. Texas does better in hot weather, but climate change is altering weather patterns and extreme weather events are becoming more common. While we need to mitigate climate change and will need government-driven public policy to do that, we must also adapt to the climate change that is already underway. That need to adapt also requires a more active government presence than the ideologues running Texas want to allow.\n\nEnergy is not the only industry damaged by uncontrolled market forces. Health care is also suffering from the impact of health insurance companies on hospitals and medical care. The shortage of intensive care beds during the COVID-19 pandemic can be traced to efforts to enhance cost-effectiveness in hospitals. Extra capacity is considered waste that must be reflected in the price of care. Eliminate that capacity and costs can be reduced. Instead of paying for and storing extra personal protective equipment, hospitals utilize just-in-time supply chains to meet immediate needs. The system worked well until a pandemic hit and the supply chains could not meet dramatically increased demand.\n\nI am not arguing against just-in-time production or global supply chains, but rather for adequate public investment in infrastructure and supplies to meet the needs of emergencies. The public interest requires rules that may inhibit unfettered markets, but if regulations are designed with care, we can retain the benefits brought by the competitive marketplace. In some instances, we won’t need regulation but instead, require public infrastructure investment. For example, a more resilient electric grid could consist of thousands of microgrids knitted together into a national smart grid. Some of the capital for rebuilding the grid could come from federal infrastructure investment- the type needed to revive the American economy. The modern grid will produce energy at lower costs, making our economy more productive. A more robust system of public health will require enhanced local virus testing, tracing and isolation capacity and biological scanning of air travelers by the TSA. Travelers can fund the TSA, but local taxes will need to pay for local public health capacity.\n\nTo resume and maintain our way of life in a complex, interconnected global economy, we will need to develop a set of rules and build the institutional capacity needed to protect us from 21st-century threats. These range from terrorism to pandemics to the impact of extreme weather events. Our ability to enjoy the benefits of modern technology requires that public management become more effective and efficient. It is time to reject the idea that government is the problem and the solution to our problems is to “starve the beast” and disinvest in the public sector. That may have been an answer to some of the issues faced by Ronald Reagan and his contemporaries in 1980, but it is completely inadequate to the issues we are facing four decades later.\n\nDeregulation has failed. But reimposing rigid rules is unlikely to result in better outcomes. We need to develop incentives and disincentives that result in private behaviors that meet the requirements of the public interest. Some of that is pure command and control regulation. Every traffic system requires some traffic lights. But, tax credits and deductions, public investments, government-funded research and other forms of subsidies must be designed to achieve public ends rather than reward powerful interests. This will not be easy to do. We need to develop regulatory strategies that incentivize private behaviors to meet public needs. One size does not fit all, and we need to recognize that in formulating and implementing regulation.\n\nOur ability to measure performance is far greater than it was in the middle of the 20th century. The technology of observation, communication and information has advanced dramatically and can enable more targeted and effective rules. Remote sensing can replace human inspections and some auditing functions can be automated. We need to apply ingenuity and design to more effective and flexible policies and public investments. Effective public management requires financial investment, brainpower and political will. We should use the market to meet our needs rather than worship the market as the solution to all problems.\n\nA year of COVID-19 lockdown has demonstrated the inadequacy of what remains of our public sector. Our unwillingness to tax ourselves and invest in public sector infrastructure or organizational capacity has resulted in disease, death and trillions of dollars of economic damage. Last week in Texas, the free market in energy delivered cold and misery. For the past year, we have struggled to contain a virus that could have been isolated and eliminated with a more robust, competent system of public health. The benefits of modern technology bring costs. We need to understand those negative impacts and protect ourselves from them.\n\nIn a world where disinformation abounds and reality has become controversial, it will be a challenge to develop a more sophisticated, fact-based system of governance. A large number of Americans do not believe that our climate is changing and do not believe that COVID-19 is real. They think that Donald Trump’s reelection was stolen by nefarious forces and that the January 6th insurrection was led by Antifa. Despite these fact-free accounts, hundreds of insurrectionists are headed to courtrooms, thousands of COVID victims have died and millions of climate deniers in Texas suffered last week from the impact of climate-induced extreme weather. My hope is that Americans will accept reality and reject ideology. We need pragmatism and we need to be willing to pay the hand we are dealt. We saw signs of that in the recent election and in the poll data that indicates 70% of the country favors the Biden pandemic relief package. America’s government is a sleeping giant that seems to be slowly waking up from decades of slumber.\n\nViews and opinions expressed here are those of the authors, and do not necessarily reflect the official position of the Columbia Climate School, Earth Institute or Columbia University.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nOver 2 million Texas residents were left without electricity.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Google’s parent company lost $100bn and Microsoft $7bn.\n\nNvidia’s fall was the biggest in US stock market history.\n\nThe DeepSeek AI assistant also topped the Apple app store in the US and UK over the weekend, above OpenAI’s ChatGPT.\n\nUS President Donald Trump said DeepSeek should be a “wake-up call for our industries that we need to be laser-focused on competing to win”.\n\nHe said he had been “reading about China” and its companies, in particular one that had come up with a “faster method of AI and [a] much less expensive method”.\n\n“That’s good because you don’t have to spend as much money. I view that as a positive, as an asset,” Trump said.\n\nOpenAI chief executive Sam Altman praised DeepSeek’s launch, saying that it was “invigorating to have a new competitor”.\n\nIn a social media post, Altman called it “an impressive model, particularly around what they’re able to deliver for the price”.\n\nJapanese tech firms linked to the AI sector tanked for a second straight day on Tuesday as investors tracked the rout on Wall Street. Advantest plunged more than 9%, while tech investor SoftBank, a key investor in Trump’s Stargate AI project, tumbled more than 5%, having lost 8% the day before.\n\nMost other Asian markets rose in limited trade ahead of the lunar new year break.\n\nDeepSeek was hit with a cyber-attack on Monday, forcing it to temporarily limit registrations. On its status page, DeepSeek said it started to investigate the issue late Monday night Beijing time. After about two hours of monitoring, the company said it was the victim of a “large-scale malicious attack”. While DeekSeek limited registrations, existing users were still able to log on as usual.\n\nDeepSeek claims to have used fewer chips than its rivals to develop its models, making them cheaper to produce and raising questions over a multibillion-dollar AI spending spree by US companies that has boosted markets in recent years.\n\nThe company developed bespoke algorithms to build its models using reduced-capability H800 chips produced by Nvidia, according to a research paper published in December.\n\nNvidia’s most advanced chips, H100s, have been banned from export to China since September 2022 by US sanctions. Nvidia then developed the less powerful H800 chips for the Chinese market, although they were also banned from export to China last October.\n\nDeepSeek’s success at building an advanced AI model without access to the most cutting-edge US technology has raised concerns about the efficacy of Washington’s attempts to stymie China’s hi-tech sector.\n\nMarc Andreessen, a leading US venture capitalist, compared the launch of DeepSeek’s R1 model last Monday to a pivotal moment in the US-USSR space race, posting on X that it was AI’s “Sputnik moment” – referring to when the Soviet Union astounded its cold war rival by launching a satellite into orbit.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Liang reportedly started buying Nvidia chips in 2021 to develop AI models as a hobby, bankrolled by his hedge fund. In 2023, he founded DeepSeek, which is based in the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou.\n\nThe company is purely focused on research rather than commercial products – the DeepSeek assistant and underlying code can be downloaded for free, while DeepSeek’s models are also cheaper to operate than OpenAI’s o1.\n\nIn an interview with Chinese media, Liang said “AI should be affordable and accessible to everyone”. Liang also said that the gap between US and Chinese AI was only one to two years.\n\nThe DeepSeek development raises doubts over the necessity for hefty investment in AI infrastructure such as chips and the market-leading role of US tech companies in AI, which in turn threatens to put American tech sector valuations under pressure.\n\nDeepSeek claims R1 cost $5.6m to develop, compared with much higher estimates for western-developed models, although experts have cautioned that may be an underestimate. Last year Dario Amodei, the co-founder of leading AI firm Anthropic, put the current cost of training advanced models at between $100m and $1bn.\n\nAnalysts at US investment bank Goldman Sachs raised the alarm over AI spending last year by publishing a note in June with the title “Gen AI: too much spend, too little benefit?”\n\nIt asked if a $1tn investment in AI over the next few years will “ever pay off”, voicing concerns about a return on spending that may have been crystalised by DeepSeek.\n\nThe pan-European Stoxx 600 fell on Monday, and major European technology stocks were down. The Dutch chipmaker ASML slid by 7%, while Germany’s Siemens Energy, which provides hardware for AI infrastructure, was down nearly 20%, and France’s digital automation company Schneider Electric fell by 9.5%.\n\nRichard Hunter, the head of markets at the platform Interactive Investor, said: “It will almost certainly put the cat among the pigeons as investors scramble to assess the potential damage it could have on a burgeoning industry, which has powered much of the gain seen in the main indices over the last couple of years.\n\n“The larger question has suddenly become whether the hundreds of billions of dollar investment in AI needs re-evaluation.”\n\nDr Andrew Duncan, the director of science & innovation at the UK’s Alan Turing Institute, said the DeepSeek development was “really exciting” because it “democratised access” to advanced AI models by being an open source developer, meaning it makes its models freely available – a path also followed by Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta with its Llama model.\n\n“Academia and the private sector will be able to play around and explore with it and use it as a launching,” he said.\n\nDuncan added: “It demonstrates that you can do amazing things with relatively small models and resources. It shows that you can innovate without having the massive resources, say, of OpenAI.”\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nDonald Trump hailed a $500 billion plan by OpenAI, SoftBank, and Oracle.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Russia’s Putin battles to regain control after short-lived revolt\nContent: Members of Wagner group looks from a military vehicle in Rostov-on-Don late on June 24, 2023. Roman Romokhov | AFP | Getty Images\n\nThe recent Wagner rebellion exposed deep divisions within Russia's military forces, raising questions about what it all means for the mercenary group's fighters and the war in Ukraine. In the space of just a few chaotic hours on June 24, the Wagner Group launched an apparent insurrection by sending an armored convoy toward the Russian capital. It marked what many regard as the greatest challenge to Russian President Vladimir Putin's authority in his more than two decades in power. The short-lived rebellion was abruptly called off, however, when Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin agreed to de-escalate the situation and ordered his fighters advancing on Moscow to return to their bases. The fallout has left many observers of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine asking what next for the Wagner Group's future, both in Europe and across the globe. The Institute for the Study of War, a U.S.-based think tank, said in its latest Russia offensive campaign assessment that the Kremlin may seek to assume formal control of the Wagner Group and turn it into a state-owned enterprise, although it is not yet clear if this is the Kremlin's intention.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin meets with servicemen at the Kremlin in Moscow on June 27, 2023. Mikhail Tereshchenko | AFP | Getty Images\n\n\"The nationalization of Wagner would likely aid in the Russian Ministry of Defense's (MoD) effort to subsume existing Wagner personnel into the regular Russian Armed Forces through contracts,\" the ISW said Thursday. \"The Kremlin has not indicated that it intends to nationalize Wagner, and it is possible that Putin has yet to determine what course of action to take in subordinating the group more firmly under the Kremlin's control.\" Putin said Tuesday that members of the Wagner mercenary group was entirely funded and fully supplied by the state. It was the first time the long-time Russian president had publicly acknowledged the group was funded by the Kremlin. The ISW also noted recent satellite imagery collected between June 15 to June 27 appeared to show the active construction of a speculated new Wagner base in Asipovichy, Belarus. The site, the think tank said, is within 15 kilometers (9.3 miles) of a large Belarusian combine arms training ground. It adds that Wagner personnel may deploy elsewhere in Belarus, however, and \"there is nothing particularly unique\" about a potential Wagner base in Asipovichy. Wagner Group's Prigiozhin arrived in Belarus on Tuesday shortly after agreeing to leave Russia in a deal brokered by Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko. Belarus is an ally of Russia in Putin's war in Ukraine.\n\nWhat next for Wagner's fighters?\n\nAnalysts told CNBC earlier this week that the fallout of the Wagner revolt could mean Russia's most effective unit in Ukraine was now out of the war, potentially weakening the performance of Moscow's forces on the battlefield. The Pentagon has since said, however, that the U.S. continues to see \"some elements\" of the Wagner Group in Russian-occupied territory in Ukraine. \"In terms of the future of Wagner Group, that's really a question best addressed by Russia, which of course … funds the Wagner Group, and how they will be employed going throughout the rest of this conflict and elsewhere around the world, since ... they also conduct operations in Africa, as well as Syria,\" Pentagon spokesman Brigadier General Pat Ryder told reporters on Thursday.\n\nBANGUI, Central African Republic - March 22, 2023: A Russian flag hangs on the monument of the Russian instructors in Bangui, during a march in support of Russia and China's presence in the Central African Republic. Wagner Group has been active in the country since 2018, supporting President Faustin-Archange Touadéra's government and filling a security vacuum left by France. BARBARA DEBOUT/AFP via Getty Images\n\nAsked in a news briefing how many Wagner fighters were currently active in Ukraine following last weekend's uprising, Ryder said some units of the mercenary group were still in the country but declined to provide a ballpark figure. \"That's something that we'll continue to keep an eye on. It's just too early to tell right now,\" Ryder said. \"My observation in all of this analysis on what could happen next is that there is a danger of not seeing the wood for the trees,\" Christopher Granville, managing director of global political research at TS Lombard, told CNBC via telephone. It's essential to remain focused on the battle in Ukraine, Granville said, noting that Putin's political future is dependent on the war's outcome. \"That's really what it boils down to,\" he added. At best, Granville said the Wagner Group was likely to be \"a shadow of its former self\" in Ukraine following the revolt.\n\nRussia's political crisis\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Friday dismissed questions about a political crisis. Speaking at a news conference, Lavrov said that Moscow always emerges stronger and more resilient from any difficulties, Reuters reported. He added that if the West had doubts about Russia's stability, that was their problem. Elsewhere, Russian Gen. Sergei Surovikin, the deputy commander of Russian forces fighting in Ukraine, was believed to have been detained following the Wagner revolt, the Associated Press reported Thursday, citing two people familiar with the matter and Ukrainian intelligence assessments.

After protesters clashed with law enforcement and breached the Capitol building, Trump tweeted to his supporters to “stay peaceful.”\n\n“Please support our Capitol Police and Law Enforcement,” Trump tweeted, as tear gas was deployed in the locked-down Capitol. “They are truly on the side of our Country. Stay peaceful!”\n\n“We’re going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women, and we’re probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them,” Trump said.\n\nBoth chambers abruptly went into recess. The District of Columbia's Mayor, Muriel Bowser, issued a curfew for 6 p.m.\n\nThe skirmishes occurred outside in the very spot where president-elect Biden will be inaugurated in just two weeks.\n\nProtesters tore down metal barricades at the bottom of the Capitol’s steps and were met by officers in riot gear. Some tried to push past the officers who held shields and officers could be seen firing pepper spray into the crowd to keep them back. Some in the crowd were shouting “traitors” as officers tried to keep them back.\n\nA suspicious package was also reported in the area, Capitol Police said.\n\nThe skirmishes came just shortly after Trump addressed thousands of his supporters, riling up the crowd with his baseless claims of election fraud at a rally near the White House on Wednesday ahead of Congress' vote.\n\n“We will not let them silence your voices,” Trump told the protesters, who had lined up before sunrise to get a prime position to hear the president.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nProtesters clashed with police and breached security barriers at the Capitol.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

I can’t find the words to describe my frustration,” said Kim Hyo-lim, 23, after the motion failed. “I am devastated, but I feel honored to be a part of this historic moment for my country.”\n\nAs the rally kicked off in the afternoon, the atmosphere was festive. Many parents brought along their young children.\n\nLee Soo-young, 38, pushed her 2-year-old son in a stroller. “I don’t want him to live in a country that could be under martial law again,” she said.\n\nOver the next few hours, the crowds swelled, even as night fell and the temperature dropped. Seoul’s subway operator closed three nearby stations, yet people continued to flow in, filling several blocks and intersections. Many people held candles or colorful light sticks. They carried blankets to bundle up against the temperatures, which have hovered near freezing all week. Chants and music could be heard from blocks away.\n\nOrganizers used Facebook to arrange cross-country transportation: shuttle buses from cities hours away from Seoul and even plane rides from Jeju, an island off the southern coast. On X, people shared names that protesters could give at nearby cafes to get free drinks.\n\nWhile most of the attention was on the crowds outside the National Assembly, in another part of Seoul, a much smaller group of Mr. Yoon’s supporters gathered in one of the city’s main plazas. Mr. Yoon’s low approval rating plunged further this week. But thousands of his supporters sang anthems and waved South Korean and U.S. flags on Saturday.\n\nDemonstrators there did not want to talk about the short-lived martial law. Instead, person after person criticized the leader of the main opposition party, Lee Jae-myung, calling him a communist, and said Mr. Yoon was protecting the country from communism and preserving its relationship with the United States.\n\nWhile the crowd supporting Mr. Yoon was predominantly older, outside the National Assembly, many were protesting for the first time.\n\nAmong them was An Ye-young, 19, who said her parents disagreed with her politically. “For many of us who don’t usually pay attention to politics, and have just turned old enough to vote, there’s been a wake-up call to become more aware,” she said.\n\nThe night martial law was imposed, Ms. An couldn’t sleep. She rewatched “A Taxi Driver,” the South Korean film about the uprising against martial law in Gwangju in May 1980. “When I saw the scenes where citizens raised their voices,” she said, “I thought I should go and protest.”\n\nChang W.

The demonstrators marched through the streets of downtown L.A. without much incident, and at one point blocked the 101 Freeway.\n\nBut eventually the protest turned more violent. Two California Highway Patrol cars were vandalized during the confrontation, and one demonstrator was injured after falling off a CHP cruiser as it drove away. That protester received medical attention; the person’s condition was not released.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLater, anti-police graffiti was sprayed at LAPD headquarters.\n\nIn a statement, the LAPD said: “We hear your anger & your pain. We will always facilitate freedom of speech. Period. All we ask is that protests are held in a safe & legal manner.”\n\nLos Angeles Police Chief Michel Moore said Wednesday night that he was also “troubled by the violence on the freeway.”\n\nEarlier in the day, he issued a statement calling the video in the Floyd case disturbing and said it tarnished the badge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“The actions I watched in the video were incredibly disturbing and go against the basic law enforcement principle of preservation of life,” he said.\n\nL.A. County Sheriff Alex Villanueva responded to the downtown protest on Facebook: “Violence is unwarranted and takes away from the message. I urge all of us to protest peacefully for the sake of everyone’s public safety,” he said.\n\nOn Thursday, Mayor Eric Garcetti said in a tweet that Angelenos should “follow their conscience in response to the pain and senselessness of this horror,” but he cautioned that protests should remain peaceful.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I will always believe in expressing ourselves powerfully, peacefully, and safely,” the mayor said on Twitter. “George Floyd was killed before our eyes — and we have every reason to be angry, to cry out for justice, to say never again.”\n\nJaime Carter, who demonstrated with a charred American flag, said he hoped the motorists forced to a standstill on the blocked freeway realized a traffic jam was “a lot less of an inconvenience than me losing my life, than me not living a life of dignity.”\n\nCarter, a student at Cal State L.A., said he came to protest not only the death of Floyd but of many black men and children who died an unjust death.\n\n“It’s Emmett Till , it’s LaQuan McDonald ,” he said. “It’s every one of them.”\n\nCharlie Morales, who also took part in the freeway protest, said that a CHP cruiser drove by trying to scatter the demonstrators and that some demonstrators converged on the vehicle.\n\nMorales, 27, said he hopes the “small inconvenience” to commuters leaving downtown has made them consider “a matter of life or death to black and brown people.”\n\nPolice brutality happens “every week,” he said, “but nothing changes until you start interrupting, until you start putting it directly in the minds of people who aren’t affected by it.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Floyd case has gotten national attention and has sparked several protests.\n\nThe mayor of Minneapolis on Wednesday called for criminal charges to be filed against the white police officer seen on the video kneeling on Floyd’s during his arrest, even after Floyd said he couldn’t breathe and stopped moving.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nThe Los Angeles Mayor agreed to increase the LAPD budget cut to $150 million, to be redistributed to non-profit agencies.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert at causal reasoning."}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n### CONTEXT\n[Doc 1]\nTitle: August 22, 2021\nContent: A week after the Taliban took control of Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, as the U.S. was withdrawing the forces that have been in the country since 2001, the initial chaos created by the Taliban’s rapid sweep across the country has simmered down into what is at least a temporary pattern.\n\nWe knew there was a good chance that the Taliban would regain control of the country when we left, although that was not a foregone conclusion. The former president, Donald Trump, recognized that the American people were tired of the ongoing war in Afghanistan, which was approaching its 20th year, and in February 2020, his administration negotiated with the Taliban to enable the U.S. to withdraw. In exchange for the release of 5000 Taliban fighters and the promise that the U.S. would withdraw within the next 14 months, the Taliban agreed not to attack U.S. soldiers.\n\nTrump’s dislike of the war in Afghanistan reflected the unpopularity of the long engagement, which by 2020 was ill defined. The war had begun in 2001, after terrorists affiliated with al-Qaeda attacked the United States on September 11 of that year. Taliban leaders in control of Afghanistan sheltered al-Qaeda, and after the attacks, the U.S. president, George W. Bush, demanded that Afghanistan hand over the terrorist leader believed to be behind the terrorist attack on the U.S: Osama bin Laden. In October, after Taliban leaders refused, the U.S. launched a bombing campaign.\n\nThat campaign was successful enough that in December 2001 the Taliban offered to surrender. But the U.S. rejected that surrender, determined by then to eradicate the extremist group and fill the vacuum of its collapse with a new, pro-American government. Al-Qaeda leader bin Laden escaped from Afghanistan to Pakistan, and the U.S. project in Afghanistan turned from an anti-terrorism mission into an effort to rebuild the Afghan government into a modern democracy.\n\nBy 2002 the Bush administration was articulating a new doctrine in foreign policy, arguing that the U.S. had a right to strike preemptively against countries that harbor terrorists. In 2003, under this doctrine, the U.S. launched a war on Iraq, which diverted money, troops, and attention from Afghanistan. The Taliban regrouped and began to regain the territory it had lost after the U.S. first began its bombing campaign in 2001.\n\nBy 2005, Bush administration officials privately worried the war in Afghanistan could not be won on its current terms, especially with the U.S. focused on Iraq. Then, when he took office in 2009, President Barack Obama turned his attention back to Afghanistan. He threw more troops into that country, bringing their numbers close to 100,000. In 2011, the U.S. military located bin Laden in Abbottabad, Pakistan, and launched a raid on the compound where he was hiding, killing him. By 2014, Obama had drawn troops in Afghanistan down to about 11,000, and in December of that year, he announced that the mission of the war—weakening the Taliban and capturing bin Laden—had been accomplished, and thus the war was over. The troops would come home.\n\nBut, of course, they didn’t, leaving Trump to develop his own policy. But his administration’s approach to the chaos in that country was different than his predecessor’s. By negotiating with the Taliban and excluding the Afghan government the U.S. had been supporting, the Trump team essentially accepted that the Taliban were the most important party in Afghanistan. The agreement itself reflected the oddity of the negotiations. Each clause referring to the Taliban began: “The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan which is not recognized by the United States as a state and is known as the Taliban will….”\n\nIt was immediately clear that the Taliban was not living up to its side of the bargain. Although it did stop attacking U.S. troops, It began to escalate violence in Afghanistan itself, assassinated political opponents, and maintained ties to al-Qaeda. Nonetheless, the Trump administration put pressure on the leaders of the Afghan government to release the 5000 Taliban prisoners, and they eventually did. Before Biden took office, Trump dropped the U.S. troop engagement in Afghanistan from about 13,000 to about 2500.\n\nWhen he took office, Biden had to decide whether to follow Trump’s path or to push back on the Taliban on the grounds they were not honoring the agreement Trump’s people had hammered out. Biden himself wanted to get out of the war. At the same time, he recognized that fighting the Taliban again would mean throwing more troops back into Afghanistan, and that the U.S. would again begin to take casualties. He opted to get the troops out, but extended the deadline to September 11, 2021, the twentieth anniversary of the initial attack. (Former president Trump complained that the troops should come out faster.)\n\nWhat Biden did not foresee was the speed with which the Taliban would retake control of the country. It swept over the regional capitals and then Kabul in about nine days in mid-August with barely a shot fired, and the head of the Afghan government fled the country, leaving it in chaos.\n\nThat speed left the U.S. flatfooted. Afghans who had been part of the government or who had helped the U.S. and its allies rushed to the airport to try to escape. In the pandemonium of that first day, up to seven people were killed; two people appear to have clung to a U.S. military plane as it took off, falling to their deaths.\n\nAnd yet, the Taliban, so far, has promised amnesty for its former opponents and limited rights for women. It has its own problems, as the Afghan government has been supported for the previous 20 years by foreign money, including a large percentage from the U.S. Not only has that money dried up as foreign countries refuse to back the Taliban, but also Biden has put sanctions on Afghanistan and also on some Pakistanis suspected of funding the Taliban. At the same time it appears that no other major sponsor, like Russia or China, has stepped in to fill the vacuum left by U.S. money, leaving the Taliban fishing for whatever goodwill it can find.\n\nYesterday, Josh Marshall of Talking Points Memo flagged tweets showing that members of the Afghan government, including the brother of the president who fled, are in what appear from the photos posted on Twitter to be relaxed talks about forming a new government. Other factions in Afghanistan would like to stop this from happening, and today Biden’s national security adviser Jake Sullivan warned that ISIS-K, another extremist group, is threatening to attack the airport to destabilize the Taliban.\n\nMeanwhile, there are 10,000 people crowded into that airport, and U.S. evacuations continue. The Kabul airport is secure—for now—and the U.S. military has created a larger perimeter around it for protection. The U.S. government has asked Americans in Afghanistan to shelter in place until they can be moved out safely; the Qatari ambassador to Afghanistan has been escorting groups of them to the airport. Evacuations have been slower than hoped because of backlogs at the next stage of the journey, but the government has enlisted the help of 18 commercial airlines to move those passengers forward, leaving room for new evacuees.\n\nYesterday, about 7800 evacuees left the Kabul airport. About 28,000 have been evacuated since August 14.\n\nInterestingly, much of the U.S. media is describing this scenario as a disaster for President Biden. Yet, on CNN this morning, Matthew Dowd, who was the chief strategist for the Bush-Cheney ticket in 2004, noted that more than 20,000 people have been evacuated from Afghanistan without a single loss of an American life, while in the same period of time, 5000 Americans have died from Covid-19 and 500 have died from gunshots.\n\n—-\n\nNotes:\n\nhttps://www.npr.org/2020/02/29/810537586/u-s-signs-peace-deal-with-taliban-after-nearly-2-decades-of-war-in-afghanistan\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2021/08/12/obama-afghan-war-ending-afghanistan-papers-book-excerpt/\n\nhttps://www.factcheck.org/2021/08/timeline-of-u-s-withdrawal-from-afghanistan/\n\nhttps://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/you-wouldnt-know-it-from-the-us-news-coverage-but\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/16/kabul-airport-chaos-and-panic-as-afghans-and-foreigners-attempt-to-flee-the-capital\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2021/08/22/afghanistan-biden-evacuations/\n\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2021/08/21/politics/kabul-airport-terror-warning/index.html\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/08/17/treasury-taliban-money-afghanistan/\n\nShare\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nOn August 15, 2021, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani fled the country.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

In a shock twist, a rebellion led by Wagner Group chief Yevgeny Prigozhin appeared on Saturday to develop into a short-lived military coup. After seizing official buildings in the southern city of Rostov-on-Don — which borders Ukraine and is an important logistical hub for the Kremlin’s war effort — and launching a column of armored vehicles towards Moscow, Prigozhin announced Saturday evening that he was halting the march towards the capital and that his soldiers would retreat to their camps “to avoid bloodshed.”\n\nAt the end of a frenetic day, the Kremlin announced that it planned to drop all charges against Prigozhin and the soldiers who took part in the uprising. And that the Wagner leader, whose whereabouts Putin’s spokesman said were unknown, would be allowed to take refuge in Belarus.\n\nPrigozhin’s rebellion against the Defense Ministry, which turned into the first coup attempt Russia has seen in three decades, has weakened Russian President Vladimir Putin and his regime as it faces the Ukrainian counteroffensive.\n\n“Now the moment has come when blood can be shed,” said Prigozhin in an audio broadcast on one of his Telegram channels. “Therefore, realizing all the responsibility for the fact that Russian blood will be shed from one side, we will turn our convoys around and go in the opposite direction to our field camps.”\n\nAccording to Western intelligence sources, behind-the-scenes negotiations with the mercenary chief to halt the march took place all day long. Since Saturday morning, Prigozhin escalated his defiance and rebellion by seizing the center of the border town of Rostov-on-Don and then ignored Putin’s warnings to stand down.\n\nBelarusian President Aleksandr Lukashenko claimed credit for negotiating the deal, saying in a statement that an “absolutely profitable and acceptable” agreement had been reached and that he had been given unspecified “security guarantees” for the mercenaries. Prigozhin’s revolt was extremely risky: the businessman does not have the support of the elites.\n\nDuring Friday night and Saturday day, Prigozhin crossed his own personal Rubicon. Backed into a corner by his escalating dispute with Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, he launched a rebellion that, even if it has fizzled out now, could not be without consequences. President Putin — who until Saturday had permitted Prigozhin’s quarrels with his defense minister — charged against the mercenaries chief, accusing Prigozhin of treason and “stabbing the Russian people in the back.” He promised to crush the coup, promising to “decisive action” to stabilize the situation.\n\nPrigozhin and his mercenaries met little opposition in their march towards Moscow. There were several attacks from the air with regular army helicopters, gunfire from a fighter plane and two fuel tanks were blown up to hinder their advance. The uprising is the most serious threat the Kremlin has faced since the Chechen war two decades ago. The situation may fuel internal conflicts in Russia, triggered by the defeats of the Kremlin forces in Ukraine and the lack of means, material and preparation of Russia’s troops. Prigozhin has denounced all these problems in a constant litany that has helped him gain greater visibility.\n\nThe Wagner crisis and its resolution are of grave geopolitical importance, given Russia possesses one of the world’s largest arsenals of nuclear weapons. Globally, it was met with a muted global reaction. The G-7 countries held an emergency call and, together with the EU and NATO allies, said they were closely monitoring the situation. But they did not venture to say more, fearing the Kremlin could use their words in their rhetoric against the West. Instead, they described the situation as an “internal problem” for Russia. Meanwhile, Russia’s Foreign Ministry warned Western countries against trying to “exploit” the Wagner Group rebellion “to achieve their Russophobic goals.”\n\nRussian authorities on Saturday declared an “anti-terrorist operations regime” in Moscow, which allowed them to close roads, monitor conversations and restrict movement. Before Prigozhin announced an end to the Wagner Group’s so-called “march for justice,” Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin declared that next Monday would be a non-working day — except for security forces and city services — and urged citizens to avoid the streets.\n\nIn a fiery speech on Saturday, Putin lashed out at what he considered the mercenary leader’s betrayal — until now, Prigozhin had been loyal to the Russian president and left him out of his verbal attacks against Shoigu, Moscow elites and “corrupt bureaucrats.” Without mentioning Prigozhin by name, Putin compared Saturday’s uprising to the 1917 revolution that destroyed the Russian Empire, “when the country was fighting World War I, but its victory was stolen.”\n\n“We will not let this happen again. We will protect our people and state from any threats, including internal betrayal. What we’re facing is exactly a betrayal,” said Putin in a five-minute speech broadcast Saturday morning on state TV. “Big ambitions and personal interests led to treason. Betrayal of one’s own country and people and of the cause that fighters of Wagner were dying for alongside our soldiers.”\n\n“Any internal mutiny is a deadly threat to our state, to us as a nation. It’s a blow against Russia, against our people. And our actions to defend the fatherland from such a threat will be brutal,” said Putin, who added that security forces had been ordered to regain control of the city of Rostov-on-Don. Information from flight tracking and registration websites showed that at least two aircraft of the fleet that carries the Kremlin leadership flew from Moscow to St. Petersburg on Saturday afternoon. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov maintained that Putin was still in the capital.\n\nIn response to Putin’s speech, Prigozhin released an audio message on his Telegram channels, in which he argued that the Russian president was “sorely mistaken” and defended Wagner mercenaries as the true patriots of Russia. “No one is going to give themselves up at the request of the president, the [Russian secret service] FSB or anyone else. We don’t want this country to go on living in corruption, deception and bureaucracy,” said Prigozhin, hours before standing down, in a heated message against military elites, whom he accuses of sending Russian troops unprepared into the “meat grinder” of Ukraine.\n\nThe decision to retreat was opposed by some members of the Wagner Group, who have accused Prigozhin of being a politician “like the rest” and of “incriminating” the mercenaries with his rebellion. Messages from mercenaries claiming they were breaking their contract with Wagner went viral on some Telegram channels, although local media footage from Rostov-on-Don, which acted as a base for the mercenaries on Saturday, showed several of them relaxing and talking to citizens.\n\nWindow of opportunity for Ukrainian counteroffensive\n\nWagner’s rebellion may have major consequences for the war in Ukraine due to its implication for frontline troops and the fact that it comes at a decisive moment for the Ukrainian counteroffensive. Ukrainian Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Maliar said Saturday that the rebellion, which exposes the cracks already pervading Russian society, is a “window of opportunity” for her forces. The decision to launch the full-scale invasion of Ukraine has triggered “the inevitable degradation of the Russian state,” she said.\n\nKyiv, which estimates that Moscow keeps some 400,000 Russian military personnel deployed in Ukraine, welcomed the instability in the invading country. “Everything is just beginning in Russia,” Mykhailo Podolyak, a top adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said Saturday, referring to the divisions shaking the neighboring country. According to Podolyak, it was impossible for both sides to emerge unscathed from the revolt: either the Kremlin or Prigozhin had to be defeated.\n\n“The split between the elites is now too obvious,” said Podolyak. “Someone must lose.” In a message on Twitter, the adviser also pointed out that the “counter-terrorist operation” had already resulted in the seizure of Rostov, a number of federal highways and the military headquarters of the Southern District.\n\nBritish intelligence reports say that Russia is facing its biggest domestic challenge in years, in which the degree of the military’s loyalty to the Kremlin will be key. The well-known enmity between Prigozhin and the Kremlin has escalated to “military confrontation” and the passivity with which some Russian military personnel have accepted the mercenary uprising suggests that they accept it, according to the report.\n\nThe head of the Wagner mercenary organization, Yevgeny Prigozhin, has declared his rebellion against the Russian military leadership on Saturday after accusing the Armed Forces of bombing one of his camps.

ARKADY BUDNITSKY (EFE)\n\nInsults and accusations\n\nThe confrontation between Shoigu and Prigozhin peaked last week. After months of insults and veiled accusations that he had been outgunned in the Battle of Bakhmut, Prigozhin recorded a video on Thursday in which he accused the minister of lying about Russia’s “successful” defense on the Zaporizhzhia front. “A huge amount of territory is lost. Soldiers have been killed, three, four times more than what it says in documents shown to the top,” said the Wagner Group chief.\n\nBefore Prigozhin announced a halt to the march, the Head of the Chechen Republic Ramzan Kadyrov broke his silence and placed his Praetorian Guard at the Kremlin’s disposal. “The fighters of the Ministry of Defense and the Russian Guard in the Chechen Republic have already left for the zones of tension,” he said on Telegram. “We will do everything to preserve the unity of Russia and protect its statehood! The rebellion must be crushed, and if this requires harsh measures, then we are ready!”\n\nSign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage from EL PAÍS USA Edition\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nWagner troops withdrew from Rostov, the Lipetsk region, and Moscow.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert at causal reasoning."}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n### CONTEXT\n[Doc 1]\nTitle: The Texas Power Grid and the Failure of Deregulation\nContent: By now, the early message that the electricity blackout in Texas was a failure of renewable energy has been replaced by the far more complex reality of a grid not prepared for extreme weather. Texas takes pride in its free market–fueled economic environment that provides low-cost housing, cheap electricity, and plenty of personal transportation along with low taxes. The problem is that the absence of rules and governance can come back and create harm if you happen to live on a more crowded and complex planet, like the one we have here on Earth. Climate change, pandemics, traffic jams, toxic air, polluted water and poisoned land cannot be addressed by the free market alone. The market can be used to produce needed goods and services, but the idea that markets and civilization itself can survive without rules is absurd idiocy.\n\nTexas this past week was a case in point. The electric grid in Texas is built for efficiency, but it is not built for climate resilience. As Katherine Blunt and Russell Gold reported in the Wall Street Journal:\n\n“A fundamental flaw in the freewheeling Texas electricity market left millions powerless and freezing in the dark this week during a historic cold snap. The core problem: Power providers can reap rewards by supplying electricity to Texas customers, but they aren’t required to do it and face no penalties for failing to deliver during a lengthy emergency. That led to the fiasco that left millions of people in the nation’s second-most-populous state without power for days. A severe storm paralyzed almost every energy source, from power plants to wind turbines, because their owners hadn’t made the investments needed to produce electricity in subfreezing temperatures. While power providers collectively failed, the companies themselves didn’t break any rules.”\n\nThe quest for efficiency and low cost led to under-investment and energy facilities poorly prepared for cold weather. Texas does better in hot weather, but climate change is altering weather patterns and extreme weather events are becoming more common. While we need to mitigate climate change and will need government-driven public policy to do that, we must also adapt to the climate change that is already underway. That need to adapt also requires a more active government presence than the ideologues running Texas want to allow.\n\nEnergy is not the only industry damaged by uncontrolled market forces. Health care is also suffering from the impact of health insurance companies on hospitals and medical care. The shortage of intensive care beds during the COVID-19 pandemic can be traced to efforts to enhance cost-effectiveness in hospitals. Extra capacity is considered waste that must be reflected in the price of care. Eliminate that capacity and costs can be reduced. Instead of paying for and storing extra personal protective equipment, hospitals utilize just-in-time supply chains to meet immediate needs. The system worked well until a pandemic hit and the supply chains could not meet dramatically increased demand.\n\nI am not arguing against just-in-time production or global supply chains, but rather for adequate public investment in infrastructure and supplies to meet the needs of emergencies. The public interest requires rules that may inhibit unfettered markets, but if regulations are designed with care, we can retain the benefits brought by the competitive marketplace. In some instances, we won’t need regulation but instead, require public infrastructure investment. For example, a more resilient electric grid could consist of thousands of microgrids knitted together into a national smart grid. Some of the capital for rebuilding the grid could come from federal infrastructure investment- the type needed to revive the American economy. The modern grid will produce energy at lower costs, making our economy more productive. A more robust system of public health will require enhanced local virus testing, tracing and isolation capacity and biological scanning of air travelers by the TSA. Travelers can fund the TSA, but local taxes will need to pay for local public health capacity.\n\nTo resume and maintain our way of life in a complex, interconnected global economy, we will need to develop a set of rules and build the institutional capacity needed to protect us from 21st-century threats. These range from terrorism to pandemics to the impact of extreme weather events. Our ability to enjoy the benefits of modern technology requires that public management become more effective and efficient. It is time to reject the idea that government is the problem and the solution to our problems is to “starve the beast” and disinvest in the public sector. That may have been an answer to some of the issues faced by Ronald Reagan and his contemporaries in 1980, but it is completely inadequate to the issues we are facing four decades later.\n\nDeregulation has failed. But reimposing rigid rules is unlikely to result in better outcomes. We need to develop incentives and disincentives that result in private behaviors that meet the requirements of the public interest. Some of that is pure command and control regulation. Every traffic system requires some traffic lights. But, tax credits and deductions, public investments, government-funded research and other forms of subsidies must be designed to achieve public ends rather than reward powerful interests. This will not be easy to do. We need to develop regulatory strategies that incentivize private behaviors to meet public needs. One size does not fit all, and we need to recognize that in formulating and implementing regulation.\n\nOur ability to measure performance is far greater than it was in the middle of the 20th century. The technology of observation, communication and information has advanced dramatically and can enable more targeted and effective rules. Remote sensing can replace human inspections and some auditing functions can be automated. We need to apply ingenuity and design to more effective and flexible policies and public investments. Effective public management requires financial investment, brainpower and political will. We should use the market to meet our needs rather than worship the market as the solution to all problems.\n\nA year of COVID-19 lockdown has demonstrated the inadequacy of what remains of our public sector. Our unwillingness to tax ourselves and invest in public sector infrastructure or organizational capacity has resulted in disease, death and trillions of dollars of economic damage. Last week in Texas, the free market in energy delivered cold and misery. For the past year, we have struggled to contain a virus that could have been isolated and eliminated with a more robust, competent system of public health. The benefits of modern technology bring costs. We need to understand those negative impacts and protect ourselves from them.\n\nIn a world where disinformation abounds and reality has become controversial, it will be a challenge to develop a more sophisticated, fact-based system of governance. A large number of Americans do not believe that our climate is changing and do not believe that COVID-19 is real. They think that Donald Trump’s reelection was stolen by nefarious forces and that the January 6th insurrection was led by Antifa. Despite these fact-free accounts, hundreds of insurrectionists are headed to courtrooms, thousands of COVID victims have died and millions of climate deniers in Texas suffered last week from the impact of climate-induced extreme weather. My hope is that Americans will accept reality and reject ideology. We need pragmatism and we need to be willing to pay the hand we are dealt. We saw signs of that in the recent election and in the poll data that indicates 70% of the country favors the Biden pandemic relief package. America’s government is a sleeping giant that seems to be slowly waking up from decades of slumber.\n\nViews and opinions expressed here are those of the authors, and do not necessarily reflect the official position of the Columbia Climate School, Earth Institute or Columbia University.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nERCOT initiated rolling outages, leaving millions of Texans without power.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Then Nvidia released its first quarter earnings report, estimating $11 billion in sales for the second quarter–50% more than analysts had forecast–and reporting earnings per share of $1.09, $0.17 higher than predicted. “The computer industry is going through two simultaneous transitions — accelerated computing and generative AI,” Huang said in a press release. Nvidia’s chips are well poised for both and Huang said the company is “significantly increasing” supply to meet “surging demand.”\n\nThat helped trigger a stock rally for shares of both Nvidia and other AI-adjacent businesses like Advanced Micro Devices and C3.ai. After a day of bullish trading, Huang’s fortune now stands at an estimated $34 billion–up more than 23% in 24 hours and enough to make him the world’s 37th richest person, per *Forbes*’ real-time rankings.\n\n“Nvidia's results and guide leave us with our jaws dropped as the technological leadership in AI is being monetized and seems to be blasting through any lingering bear thesis concerns for now,” Cowen analysts led by Matthew Ramsay wrote Thursday.\n\nIt’s been a long road for Huang. Born in Taiwan, he moved to Thailand as a child before his parents sent him, at age 9, and his brother to the U.S. amid civil unrest in the Asian nation. He majored in computer science and chip design at Oregon State University and got an electrical engineering master’s degree from Stanford in 1992. After watching cartoonish PC games, he and cofounders Chris Malachowsky (currently Nvidia's senior technology officer) and Curtis Priem (who retired in 2003) founded Nvidia in 1993, spying a market for improving the gaming graphics. Huang, who has been CEO from the start and who tattooed the Nvidia logo on his upper-left bicep, took the business public on Nasdaq in 1999.\n\n\"There was no market in 1993, but we saw a wave coming,\" Malachowsky told *Forbes* in 2016. \"There's a California surfing competition that happens in a five-month window every year. When they see some type of wave phenomenon or storm in Japan, they tell all the surfers to show up in California, because there's going to be a wave in two days. That's what it was. We were at the beginning.\"\n\nDespite early struggles, Nvidia prevailed in the nascent market for graphics processor units, or GPUs, which enable machines to produce detailed and clean images at ultra-fast speeds. The technology ignited the PC gaming market into the gargantuan industry it has become. Today, GPUs help power gaming consoles, autonomous vehicles and robotics for more than 35,000 Nvidia customers that include Google, Mercedes-Benz, Amazon and Meta.\n\n\"The more content there is, the more visual interest there can be, the more processing horsepower people need,\" Huang told *Forbes* in 2007.\n\nNvidia’s technology has become crucial in AI-driven companies; the chips that power generative AI are essential to new services like ChatGPT or Google’s Bard. These high-power chips have a higher processing power than most on the market, making them able to process larger and more complicated data intakes.\n\n“We're seeing incredible orders to retool the world's data centers. And so I think you're seeing the beginning of, call it, a 10-year transition to basically recycle or reclaim the world's data centers and build it out as accelerated computing,\" Huang said on Wednesday’s earnings call. \"You'll have a pretty dramatic shift in the spend of a data center from traditional computing and to accelerate computing with SmartNICs, smart switches, of course GPUs and the workload is going to be predominantly generative AI.\"\n\nThat has helped drive Nvidia shares higher than ever before–helping Jensen, already a multi-billionaire, more than double his net worth this year, jumping from an estimated fortune of $13.8 billion at the start of 2023 to $34 billion as of Thursday. Nvidia, now boasting a market capitalization of $950 billion, is on the verge of becoming just the sixth company to hit the $1 trillion mark, an elite club of just Apple, Microsoft, Saudi Aramco, Google parent company Alphabet and Amazon.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nNvidia shares surged 24% to a record high, triggering a stock rally for Nvidia and other AI-adjacent businesses.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Doctors fought to save Mr Abe’s life, but despite a few moments of consciousness after the shooting, the former PM was described as being continuously comatose during desperate efforts of medical resuscitation. Responding to this apparent act of political violence, PM Fumio Kishida condemned the attack, saying: “It is barbaric…and it cannot be tolerated.” The Fire and Disaster Management Agency had earlier confirmed that Mr Abe had a bullet wound on the right of his neck, and also suffered subcutaneous bleeding under the left part of his chest. Mr Abe was said to be responsive in the minutes after the attack, but the 67-year-old’s situation later deteriorated. Eyewitnesses saw a man firing twice at Mr Abe from behind. Security officers detained the attacker, who made no attempt to run, and seized his weapon – reportedly a handmade gun.\n\nThe suspect has been identified as Nara resident Tetsuya Yamagami. Local media reports say he is believed to be a former member of Japan’s Maritime Self-Defense Forces, and that it was an improvised firearm. Explosives have subsequently been found at the suspect’s home. On Japanese social media, the hashtag, “We want democracy, not violence” was trending, with many social media users expressing their disgust towards the incident.\n\nPolitically hawkish, Shinzo Abe favoured revision of Japan’s pacifist constitution, and honoured the Yasukuni Shrine, itself controversial primarily because its Book of Souls contains the names of more than a thousand war criminals from WW2. Naturally, world leaders are stunned by Shinzo Abe’s murder. Japan’s own Foreign Ministry and several prominent politicians in Japan and abroad warned of ‘attacks on supporters of democracy everywhere’. British PM Boris Johnston described his murder as “despicable”, while French President, Emmanuel Macron said it was “an atrocity”. Antony Blinken, US secretary of state, described the shooting as a “very, very sad moment”,” speaking from the G20 in Bali, Indonesia. Former US president Donald Trump called it “a tremendous blow to the wonderful people of Japan”. Japan’s fellow Quad members, Australia, India and the US, were among the first to respond after the shooting. China’s foreign ministry also expressed “shock” at Abe’s shooting and extended condolences to his family. Kevin Rudd, the former Australian PM, called it, “a sober reminder to all our democracies of how precious our freedoms are…. an attack on supporters of democracy everywhere.”\n\nIndia’s PM Narendra Modi said he was, “deeply distressed”. Tsai Ing-wen, Taiwan president, condemned the “violent and illegal acts”. Abe’s public support for Taiwan had strengthened since he left office in the face of rising Chinese aggression against the democratic nation. Charles Michel, European Council president, said he was “shocked and saddened by the cowardly attack on Shinzo Abe… [The] EU stands with the people of Japan and [prime minister Fumio] Kishida in these difficult times.” Abe had previously outraged Chinese nationalists. A Weibo comment about the incident immediately went viral across the PRC: “Don’t forget that he visited the Yasukuni Shrine,” referring (above) to the controversial memorial that honours Japan’s war dead. Leif-Eric Easley said the shooting was a “major shock for Japanese politics and society…But Japan’s foreign policy will probably remain consistent, focused on strengthening the rules-based order with the USA and other international partners.” Anthony Albanese, Australia’s prime minister, observed, “our thoughts are with his family and the people of Japan at this time”.\n\nIn Japan, possession of firearms is restricted, and while political violence is not unheard of, Abe’s shooting revisits the memories of Japan’s Pre-World War II era. For example, PM Hirobumi Ito was killed in 1909—after he had left office—at a train station in Japanese-occupied northeast China. Indeed, Tokyo Station still bears an inscription near the site where another PM, Takashi Hara was fatally stabbed on Nov. 4, 1921. Japan’s political violence intensified during the 1930s as ultra-rightists sought to destroy the multiparty constitutional government. For example, an attempted coup on February 26, 1936, assassinated finance minister, Korekiyo Takahashi, and others, wounded the PM, and almost overwhelmed legitimate democratic government. The coup was quashed, but at the expense of growing military influence over the government.\n\nPost WW2, as Japan metamorphosed into a democracy, political violence lessened, but even so there were still outbreaks of riots and assassinations. In 1960 Otoya Yamaguchi stabbed to death Mr Inejiro Asanuma, leader of the Japanese Opposition Socialist movement. In 2007, Nagasaki’s Mayor, Iccho Ito, a fervent opponent of nuclear weapons, was shot dead by a right-wing group. Prior to this was the stabbing to death of Koki Ishii, an outspoken member of the opposition Democratic Party of Japan. These events show that Japan does to an extent possess a submerged history of political violence, uncannily in a country known for its post-WW2 pacifism and high level of public safety. Japanese citizens will surely question the fragility of their democracy as Abe will be laid to rest in public ceremonies.\n\nFurther Reading on E-International Relations\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nWorld leaders expressed shock and condemned the murder.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

I can’t find the words to describe my frustration,” said Kim Hyo-lim, 23, after the motion failed. “I am devastated, but I feel honored to be a part of this historic moment for my country.”\n\nAs the rally kicked off in the afternoon, the atmosphere was festive. Many parents brought along their young children.\n\nLee Soo-young, 38, pushed her 2-year-old son in a stroller. “I don’t want him to live in a country that could be under martial law again,” she said.\n\nOver the next few hours, the crowds swelled, even as night fell and the temperature dropped. Seoul’s subway operator closed three nearby stations, yet people continued to flow in, filling several blocks and intersections. Many people held candles or colorful light sticks. They carried blankets to bundle up against the temperatures, which have hovered near freezing all week. Chants and music could be heard from blocks away.\n\nOrganizers used Facebook to arrange cross-country transportation: shuttle buses from cities hours away from Seoul and even plane rides from Jeju, an island off the southern coast. On X, people shared names that protesters could give at nearby cafes to get free drinks.\n\nWhile most of the attention was on the crowds outside the National Assembly, in another part of Seoul, a much smaller group of Mr. Yoon’s supporters gathered in one of the city’s main plazas. Mr. Yoon’s low approval rating plunged further this week. But thousands of his supporters sang anthems and waved South Korean and U.S. flags on Saturday.\n\nDemonstrators there did not want to talk about the short-lived martial law. Instead, person after person criticized the leader of the main opposition party, Lee Jae-myung, calling him a communist, and said Mr. Yoon was protecting the country from communism and preserving its relationship with the United States.\n\nWhile the crowd supporting Mr. Yoon was predominantly older, outside the National Assembly, many were protesting for the first time.\n\nAmong them was An Ye-young, 19, who said her parents disagreed with her politically. “For many of us who don’t usually pay attention to politics, and have just turned old enough to vote, there’s been a wake-up call to become more aware,” she said.\n\nThe night martial law was imposed, Ms. An couldn’t sleep. She rewatched “A Taxi Driver,” the South Korean film about the uprising against martial law in Gwangju in May 1980. “When I saw the scenes where citizens raised their voices,” she said, “I thought I should go and protest.”\n\nChang W. Lee and Qasim Nauman contributed reporting from Seoul.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nLawmakers voted down the martial law decree.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA. Tens of thousands of protesters gathered outside the National Assembly in Seoul.\nB. President Yoon Suk Yeol declared martial law on December 3 and sent soldiers to parliament.\nC.

Gen. Qassem Soleimani, killed in a drone strike early Friday, is getting the vast majority of the media attention. But several others were also killed in the attack, including militia leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis. For years, Muhandis has been one of the most important military figures in Iraq, as the deputy commander of Iraq's Popular Mobilization Forces.\n\nBorn in Iraq as Jamal Jaafar al-Ibrahimi, Muhandis fled to Iran after Saddam Hussein came to power in the late 1970s. He was among a number of Iraqis who left to fight on the side of Iran during the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s. He is considered by the U.S. and Kuwait to be the architect of the bombing of the American and French embassies in Kuwait in 1983, and was sentenced to death by a Kuwaiti court.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nMuhandis is responsible for extensive violence against American interests. In the power vacuum that developed after the death of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein in 2006, Muhandis founded Kataib Hezbollah, an anti-U.S. insurgency movement responsible for numerous American casualties. The U.S. considered Muhandis and his insurgency to be \"terrorist\" groups.\n\n\"His network was the most professional killer of Americans in Iraq,\" says Michael Knights, senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. Knights tells NPR that the vast majority of IEDs that killed hundreds of Americans in Iraq were provided by Muhandis' network. According to Knights, the U.S. considered killing Muhandis multiple times, including in June 2011, when 15 American soldiers were killed in Iraq -- the vast majority by Kataib Hezbollah.\n\nThe killing of Muhandis came after a week of violence, much of which was orchestrated by Kataib Hezbollah. On Dec. 27, the group attacked the K1 military base near the Iraqi city of Kurkuk, killing an American contractor and wounding several American and Iraqi personnel. On Tuesday, the U.S. Embassy compound in Baghdad was stormed, as a crowd of protesters set fires and militia members tried to enter the embassy. On Thursday, U.S. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper warned Iran and its \"proxy militias\" that the U.S. would retaliate.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nMuhandis developed a reputation as being able to effectively corral dozens of Iraqi militias into a relatively cohesive fighting force. The reason he could do this, Knights says, is because he had the backing of Soleimani. \"Muhandis was a politician,\" Knights says. \"He was an Eisenhower, not a Patton.\"\n\nSecurity experts are divided on whether Muhandis was specifically targeted in the drone attack. \"It's highly likely that they were targeting him,\" Anthony Cordesman, the Burke chair in strategy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, tells NPR. \"They hit two cars. As I understand it, there were more than two cars on the road. The strikes had to have a reasonable amount of precision.\"\n\nKnights says that the operation was designed to take out Soleimani, and it was a \"bonus\" that Muhandis happened to personally pick him up off the airplane. \"It really helps to have got both.\"\n\nHad only Muhandis been killed, the first Iraqi reaction would be to ask Soleimani who could replace him, Knights says. If only Soleimani had been killed, Muhandis would still be there to lead military operations. \"Getting one or the other would have left a lot of leadership structure in place. This gives the entire system a really heavy jolt.\"\n\n\"Their combined death is certainly a blow to the Iranian project in Iraq, but how much remains to be seen,\" says Thomas Joscelyn, senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. It's hard for a Western observer to know how important Muhandis was in terms of decision-making and internal dynamics within the PMF, Joscelyn tells NPR. Was he a uniquely important figure? Or just another leader whose job can be effectively performed by his successor?\n\nCordesman agrees that exactly how great an impact Muhandis' death will have is still unknown. \"We tend to demonize these people as if they were absolutely critical, stable figures, but you had a pretty competent Iranian deputy take over the al-Quds force in less than a day,\" says Cordesman, referring to Esmail Ghaani. \"The whole idea that you paralyze a movement by getting rid of the leader, if that's true we don't have any recent examples.\"\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nIraqi caretaker Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi condemned the US air raid as a violation of Iraq’s sovereignty.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Groups in China and South Korea have also raised concern, making it a political and diplomatic issue.\n\nBut the Japanese government and TEPCO say the water must be released to make room for the plant's decommissioning and to prevent accidental leaks. They say the treatment and dilution will make the wastewater safer than international standards and its environmental impact will be negligibly small. But some scientists say long-term impact of the low-dose radioactivity that remains in the water needs attention.\n\nThe water release begins more than 12 years after the March 2011 nuclear meltdowns, caused by a massive earthquake and tsunami. It marks a milestone for the plant's battle with an ever-growing radioactive water stockpile that TEPCO and the government say have hampered the daunting task of removing the fatally toxic melted debris from the reactors.\n\nThe pump activated Thursday afternoon would send the first batch of the diluted, treated water from a mixing pool to a secondary pool, where the water is then discharged into the ocean through an undersea tunnel. The water is collected and partly recycled as cooling water after treatment, with the rest stored in around 1,000 tanks, which are already filled to 98% of their 1.37-million-ton capacity.\n\nThose tanks, which cover much of the plant complex, must be freed up to build the new facilities needed for the decommissioning process, officials said.\n\nPrime Minister Fumio Kishida said it is indispensable and and cannot be postponed. He noted an experimental removal of a small amount of the melted debris from the No. 2 reactor is set for later this year using a remote-controlled giant robotic arm.\n\nTEPCO executive Junichi Matsumoto said Thursday's release was to begin with the least radioactive water to ensure safety.\n\nFinal preparation for the release began Tuesday, when just one ton of treated water was sent from a tank for dilution with 1,200 tons of seawater, and the mixture was kept in the primary pool for two days for final sampling to ensure safety, Matsumoto said. A batch of 460 tons was to be sent to the mixing pool Thursday for the actual discharge.\n\nBut Fukushima's fisheries, tourism and economy — which are still recovering from the disaster — worry the release could be the beginning of a new hardship.\n\nFukushima's current fish catch is only about one-fifth its pre-disaster level, in part due to a decline in the fishing population. China has tightened radiation testing on Japanese products from Fukushima and nine other prefectures, halting exports at customs for weeks, Fisheries Agency officials said.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nA TEPCO staff member activated a seawater pump and an operator confirmed the release.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida announced Japan would begin discharging treated radioactive water from the Fukushima Daiichi plant into the sea as early as Thursday.\nB.

The popular district in Seoul was hosting Halloween celebrations that drew around 100,000 people when the crowd surge began. Many were attempting to gather in a narrow alley filled with bars and restaurants, according to local media.\n\nVideos have popped up online showing the sheer mass of people crowded into at least one tight street lined with bars and restaurants. Some people can be heard screaming, and most appear completely unable to move.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nOne worker at an Itaewon club, located at the uphill end of the roughly 11-foot-wide alley leading to the district's main street, recalled to reporters seeing the crowd of revelers surge on Saturday night.\n\n\"We could hear some people in the crowd saying, don't push, but someone in the back said, hey, push! Push! And people started screaming, and the crowd poured in toward our club,\" he said.\n\nThe man, who declined to give his name to reporters, said they would ordinarily not let minors into their club, but they opened their doors to try to save lives.\n\n\"But even after we did that, there were people collapsed at the entrance, and some passed out,\" he added. \"We tried to rescue them, but our club was at the end of the surge and there were already three or four layers of people piled on, so we couldn't.\"\n\nHe said his inability to help people \"keeps haunting me, and pains me.\"\n\nOther videos shared on social media show several people, some clad in their Halloween costumes, attempting CPR on rows of victims unconscious on sidewalks.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Chung Sung-Jun/Getty Images Chung Sung-Jun/Getty Images\n\nSurvivors struggle to locate friends\n\nMost of the dead had been identified by mid-morning on Sunday.

There was nobody to help me,\" he said. \"It was just me and other bystanders. And I couldn't do anything.\"\n\nIn the aftermath of the crowd surge, questions have begun to surface over whether more police should've been dispatched to the area to help control the large crowds. The Korea Herald reports that emergency crews nearby had trouble getting to the scene and to the hundreds of victims given the crowds and added traffic congestion.\n\nInterior Minister Lee Sang-min has pushed back against the idea more could've been done to prevent the tragedy, according to The Korea Herald.

In the next three years, Huawei, the world’s second largest smartphone vendor, will look to bring HarmonyOS to more devices, including smartphones, he said.\n\nYu said, without offering any proof, that HarmonyOS is “more powerful and secure than Android.” He said HarmonyOS’ IPC performance is five times that of Google’s Fuchsia. The top executive also claimed that HarmonyOS’ microkernel has “one-thousandth the amount of code in the Linux kernel.”\n\n“A modularized HarmonyOS can be nested to adapt flexibly to any device to create a seamless cross-device experience. Developed via the distributed capability kit, it builds the foundation of a shared developer ecosystem,” the company said in a statement, adding that it began to explore developing its own operating system “as early as 10 years ago.”\n\nThe company said it intends to continue to use Android moving forward, but HarmonyOS is officially its back-up plan if things go south. “We will prioritize Android for smartphones, but if we can’t use Android, we will be able to install HarmonyOS quickly,” Yu said.\n\nThe availability of the mobile operating system, which is open source, will be limited to China for now, though the company has plans to bring it to international markets at a later stage, he said.\n\nThe company said it has worked on security and trustworthiness aspects of the operating system from the ground up. It said HarmonyOS uses formal verification methods to “reshape security.” Formal verification methods are an effective mathematical approach to validate system correctness from the source, while traditional verification methods, such as functional verification and attack simulation, “are confined to limited scenarios,” the company claimed.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $475 on your TechCrunch All Stage pass Build smarter.

The U.S. government has accused Huawei of stealing trade secrets, and said it poses a risk to national security. Huawei has denied these accusations and pursued legal means to fight back.\n\nIn the aftermath, Google, Intel and other U.S.-based companies that contribute much of the technology and solutions that go into a smartphone suspended their business with Huawei, thereby severely questioning the company’s future prospects.\n\nThe ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China has already started to impact Huawei’s bottom line. The company’s performance in the quarter that ended in June was weak, compared to several previous quarters.\n\nWhat remains unclear is the kind of impact the U.S.’ accusations have had on the Chinese giant’s brand image worldwide. According to research firm Counterpoint, about half of all Huawei smartphones ship outside China.\n\nHuawei was poised to become the world’s biggest vendor by shipment — something it would have achieved — “if not for the trade war,” Yu said.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nHuawei ensured HarmonyOS supports applications developed in multiple programming languages.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

It’s called Harmony\nContent: Hong Kong CNN Business —\n\nHuawei has finally unveiled its own operating system, a move that could help shield the smartphone maker from the escalating US-China trade war.\n\nThe reveal of Harmony OS comes months after the Chinese tech company was placed on a US trade blacklist that barred American firms from selling tech and software to Huawei unless they get a license to do so. That ban has prevented companies like Google (GOOGL) from supplying new Huawei devices with its version of Android OS.\n\nHarmony, which is called “Hongmeng” in Chinese, “is completely different from Android and iOS,” Apple’s (AAPL) operating system, said Richard Yu, the CEO of Huawei’s consumer business group. He announced the software Friday at a developer conference in Dongguan, China.\n\nYu said that Huawei can start using Harmony in smartphones “at any time,” but he said that the company is giving “priority” to Android right now.\n\n“We will switch to [the] Harmony system when we can’t use Android,” he said, adding that it is “not that difficult” to migrate from Android to Huawei’s own system.\n\nHarmony will be deployed first in Huawei’s smart watches, smart screens, smart speakers and other devices, including “in-vehicle systems.” Devices that use Harmony will be integrated with each other.\n\nThe company also said that the operating system will be open sourced.\n\nHuawei is the world’s second largest smartphone seller behind Samsung and it has relied on a suite of Google services for its devices, including the Android system and the Google Play app store. But the US ban has thrown a wrench into that partnership since it was implemented in May.\n\nConsumers who already owned Huawei smartphones were largely unaffected, Google said in May. But the blacklist limited Huawei to the public version of Android for new devices — thus cutting it off from Google apps and services, including Gmail and Google maps.\n\nSales of Huawei’s smartphones have suffered in international markets as a result, but have held up well in China where most of Google’s popular products are banned anyway and Huawei has been offering alternatives. The company said Friday that it will “lay the foundations” for Harmony in China, and then “expand it further to the global ecosystem.”\n\nAmerican tech companies had hoped to soon resume sales to Huawei. But that might not be happening soon: Bloomberg reported earlier Friday that the White House plans to delay a decision on granting licenses that would allow US companies to keep selling to Huawei, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe United States claims that Huawei is a national security concern. Huawei denies that is the case, and says that none of its products pose a national security risk.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nHuawei’s smartphone sales suffered in international markets.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA. None of the others are correct causes.\nB. Huawei denied the U.S. government's accusations and pursued legal means.\nC.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert at causal reasoning."}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n### CONTEXT\n[Doc 1]\nTitle: Freezing temperatures and power outages hurt Texas’s most vulnerable yet again\nContent: SAN ANTONIO — Families living in substandard homes lacking proper insulation are often huddling around a single space heater to stay warm in South Texas. Asylum seekers are wrapping themselves in blankets and keeping a community fire ablaze in a migrant camp near the border. Community organizers in Austin, San Antonio and other major Texas cities are hustling to rescue the unhoused as hypothermia and frostbite set in.\n\nWhile the dangerously cold weather and accompanying power outages sweeping the Lone Star State are touching nearly all Texans in some way, the crisis is especially dire for the state’s most vulnerable and marginalized communities — whose lives have already been threatened by disaster, disease and destitution in recent years. Many were simply trying not to freeze to death inside their homes and cars and on the streets as they braced for another storm Tuesday night.\n\nTexas’s crippled energy system cannot generate enough electricity to power the millions of homes on its grid — from sprawling suburban mansions to the houses and apartments occupied by families already suffering from hunger and poverty. A vivid metaphor for the state’s entrenched inequities emerged Monday night: The illuminated Texas skylines of downtown buildings and newly filled luxury hotels cast against the darkened silhouettes of freezing neighborhoods.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOver one million residents in Texas remained without electricity on Feb. 16 after a historic cold outbreak and snow storm. (Video: Justin Scuiletti, Amber Ferguson/The Washington Post)\n\nWhile local governments have maneuvered to open warming centers and respond to acute emergencies, it has often been exhausted neighbors, depleted community and faith leaders, overly taxed nonprofits and everyday people who are meeting immediate needs in the face of a state government that some say has been absent from the lives of those most vulnerable. Offering help now comes with the threat of possible exposure to the coronavirus.\n\n“Texas thinks it’s some big, bad independent state, but we can’t get the power on. We need to rethink how we do things,” said Chas Moore of the Austin Justice Coalition. “When disaster hits, it hits those communities that we historically disregard and don’t pay enough attention to.”\n\nThe blanket of snow that had at first seemed like a blessing in San Antonio turned ominous as people experiencing homelessness were thrust into life-threatening danger.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I didn’t think I’d wake up alive,” said 86-year-old Angel Rodriguez Medina, who spent Monday night in a sleeping bag amid piles of snow. “It was the worst night of my life.”\n\nMorgan Handley, a case manager with Centro San Antonio, welcomed the man into a heated car on Tuesday morning but worried about the many others he had yet to reach. A coalition of social services groups had been driving around the city in recent days and rescued more than 50 people. They were taken to converted gyms and churches — anywhere that had electricity.\n\n“I’m terrified they’re going to die,” Handley said. “Last year I lost six clients. . . . I’m terrified to see how that number is going to increase in the next few days.”\n\nA little more than an hour north, Yasmine Smith spent the weekend trying to coordinate housing for more than 200 people in hotels and shelters. Her own south Austin home has no power, and she destroyed her coffee table to have wood for the chimney. Smith said she does what she can because she can’t bear the thought of someone dying under a bridge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I believe in my city as a lifelong Austinite, and I’m proud of Texas,” said Smith, the director of justice and advocacy for the Austin-area Urban League. “But this fell on the shoulders of average people who also had to ensure their own lives were saved.”\n\nSome of the most widespread and longest-lasting power outages hit Southeast Texas and greater Houston, the state’s biggest city. A mother and daughter died after their family of four suffered carbon monoxide poisoning while warming up inside their car in the garage as temperatures plunged into the single digits.\n\nThe question of when power may be restored has yet to be answered for those who rely on electricity to survive or recover from severe illness. Ralph Riviello, chair of emergency medicine at University Health in San Antonio, said about a dozen people have come into the system’s emergency rooms needing help to recharge the batteries of their breathing machines and feeding tubes.\n\nIn Dallas, Deondre Moore raised a few hundred dollars on Facebook to buy blankets and toiletries for about a dozen people living in downtown streets. Less than 12 hours later, the temperature in Moore’s power-less apartment dropped to 20 degrees, and he had to seek shelter at a friend’s home that was still heated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFaith leaders have been reaching out to parishioners who may not live in adequate housing or have access to most public benefits. Lupita Valdez, a pastoral associate at Sacred Heart church in west San Antonio, maintains a WhatsApp group chat of more than 200 parishioners who are broken up into smaller groups to help one another.\n\nThat is how Kimberly Briseño, 23, an undocumented immigrant from Nicaragua, was connected to a fellow parishioner. She has electricity but no central heat or water in her thin-walled dwelling, which was designed as an in-law suite. She, her husband and her 5-year-old daughter stay in one room with a donated space heater all day.\n\nHer 25-year-old husband hasn’t been able to work for two weeks, and the church is helping Briseño apply for a special rental assistance grant from the city. But their meals and comfort come from a woman at church.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I’ve never experienced cold like this before. We didn’t have the right clothes or know what we needed,” said Briseño, who layered short-sleeved shirts and pajama pants to stay warm. “If it wasn’t for this lady, I don’t know what we’d do. She has taken us in like we were members of her family.”\n\nLotus Rios learned early in her youth that when one person in the community falls, everyone falls. It’s a saying her grandmother invoked often.\n\n“When you take care of people, the community takes care of you,” said Rios, who owns a community pantry she opened early in the pandemic. She stopped by the southside San Antonio house of Michael Muñoz late Tuesday to bring him menudo, a Mexican soup.\n\nThe power outage “reopens a wound for a lot of these people. The deficiencies that were already existing, all these little gaps, just got wider with covid, and now with this — this is even making it wider,” Rios said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFour weeks ago, Muñoz learned that his 68-year-old mother whom he cared for full-time had covid-19. Two weeks ago, he watched her casket being lowered into the ground.\n\nThen early Monday, he woke up shivering and learned that the house he and his mother had shared no longer had power. For more than 24 hours, Muñoz has been living in a silent house, with no music to lift his spirits or even the faint hum of the refrigerator, as he processes his mother’s death and what this new obstacle means for his future.\n\n“It’s been hard,” said Muñoz, who had to pause his college studies. “Right now I have nobody here with me, it’s just me. So there’s nobody to say, ‘I’m here with you.’ ”\n\nHis mother’s death brought with it a cascading series of financial troubles that left him strapped for cash and pressed for time as the winter storm arrived. Muñoz brought his dogs inside and wrapped the pipes outside his house in cloth and duct tape, but the precautions did little to help him keep warm in an aging, paint-chipped house with little insulation. He said he’s been charging his phone in the car, eating food he bought at the corner store in the dark and has no Internet to check for weather and news updates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I’ve been trying to roll with it. But yesterday with no power, and it’s just cold, and the dog’s acting up, and the water heater giving up, one thing after another — I had a little breakdown,” he said.\n\nMuñoz said he is frustrated by the mass outages and criticized local officials who he said are not checking in on people in his Harlandale neighborhood, an economically depressed area with poor plumbing, old houses and many elderly residents.\n\nThe 43-year-old aspiring teacher has taken to cleaning the house and sorting through his mother’s old things. Pictures of her still hang on the wall. She called herself a “union, Democrat, Catholic, Mexican American woman” Muñoz said with a chuckle. She drank Jack Daniels on the rocks and led her life independently, he said.\n\n“She raised me to be a strong person,” he said. “I know what I have to do. Hopefully I’ll pull through this and see what the next step is.”\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nAustin and San Antonio issued boil-water notices.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Conducted in partnership with LeanIn.Org, this effort is the largest study of women in corporate America. Over the past decade, more than 1,000 companies have participated in the study, and we have surveyed more than 480,000 people about their workplace experiences.\n\nFor this year’s report, we collected information from 281 participating organizations that collectively employ more than ten million people. At these organizations, we surveyed more than 15,000 employees and more than 280 HR leaders, who shared insights on their policies and practices. The report provides an intersectional look at the specific biases and barriers faced by Asian, Black, Latina, and LGBTQ+ women, as well as women with disabilities.\n\nOur tenth-anniversary report analyzes data from the past decade to better understand progress, decline, and stagnation in women’s representation and experiences in the workplace. It also highlights key findings from 2024 and identifies the changes companies can make to chart real progress on the path to parity—which we project is nearly 50 years away. Over the past decade, women have made important gains at every level of the corporate pipeline (especially in senior leadership). Yet progress is surprisingly fragile, especially for women of color, who continue to be underrepresented at every level and who view gender and race as obstacles to their advancement. In many instances, we also see that women’s outlook and day-to-day experiences are not much different, or are even worse, than they were nearly a decade ago.\n\nAs we reflect on the results from this year, and from the past ten, three things are true. First, companies took action that has led to important progress. Second, change is hard and messy, and we’re somewhere in the middle of the shifts needed to fix the pipeline and make the culture of work more equitable. Third, the gains made are more fragile and less extensive than they appear. Taken together, the scorecard for corporate America is mixed—and though there are bright spots that suggest many companies have momentum, we also see that company commitment to diversity is declining. As we look ahead to the next ten years, the path forward for corporate America is simple: keep going. Over the past decade, women have remained ambitious and committed to their jobs. Now, we need companies to stay ambitious and committed to the important work they have started.\n\nThe rest of this article summarizes the main findings from the Women in the Workplace 2024 report.\n\nThe corporate pipeline: Progress is not parity\n\nOver the past decade, women’s representation has increased at every level of corporate management (Exhibit 1). Most notably, women today make up 29 percent of C-suite positions, compared with just 17 percent in 2015. But progress has been much slower earlier in the pipeline, at the entry and manager levels.\n\nImage description: Six area charts show the percentage of women employed in various corporate roles from 2015 to 2024. Women’s representation at the entry level rose from 45% in 2015 to 48% in 2024, while in manager roles it rose from 37% to 39% over the same period. Women’s representation in senior manager/director roles rose from 32% in 2015 to 37% in 2024, while in vice president roles it grew from 27% to 34% over the same time period. Women’s representation in senior vice president roles increased from 23% in 2015 to 29% in 2024, while in C-suite roles it rose from 17% to 29% over the same time period. The data show that while women’s representation in corporate roles has increased over the past decade, gains have been modest, with representation declining as women advance through the corporate hierarchy. Source: Women in the Workplace 2024, McKinsey & Company and LeanIn.Org End of image description.\n\nHowever, the corporate pipeline is not as healthy as the numbers suggest. Women remain underrepresented across the pipeline, a gender gap that persists regardless of race and ethnicity (Exhibit 2). Simply put, men outnumber women at every level.\n\nImage description: A segmented bar chart shows the percentage of men and women in various corporate roles. At the entry level, 48% of employees are women, including 28% White women and 19% women of color, while White men represent 33%. At the manager level, 39% of employees are women, including 27% White women and 13% women of color, while White men represent 41%. At the senior vice president level, 28% are women, while 58% are White men. At the C-suite, 29% of employees are women, including 22% White women and 7% women of color, while White men represent 56%. The data indicate a trend of declining representation of women in more senior roles, regardless of race and ethnicity. Note: Figures may not sum to 100%, because of rounding. Total percent of women per level may not sum to overall corporate pipeline totals, because overall figures do not include employees with unreported race data. Source: Women in the Workplace 2024, McKinsey & Company and LeanIn.Org End of image description.\n\nWhat’s more, women continue to face barriers at the beginning of the pipeline. They remain less likely than men to be hired into entry-level roles, which leaves them underrepresented from the start. Then, women are far less likely than men to attain their very first promotion to a manager role—a situation that’s not improving (Exhibit 3). In 2018, for every 100 men who received their first promotion to manager in 2018, 79 women were promoted; this year, just 81 women were. Because of this “broken rung” in the corporate ladder, men significantly outnumber women at the manager level, making it incredibly difficult for companies to support sustained progress at more senior levels. This phenomenon is even worse for women of color, who represent only 7 percent of current C-suite positions—just a four-percentage-point increase since 2017.\n\nExhibit 3 Image description: A bar chart shows the number of women promoted to manager for every 100 men promoted to manager from 2018 to 2024.

The main driver of women’s increased representation was a reduction in the number of line roles (that is, positions with profit-and-loss responsibility, a focus on the company’s core operations, or both), which disproportionately affected men given that they hold more of these positions. In the C-suite, women’s progress was even less sustainable. While the reduction of line roles was still a factor, the primary reason women’s representation increased was because companies, on average, added staff roles—that is, positions in support functions, such as human resources, legal, and IT—and hired women into these new positions. Since companies cannot add new staff roles indefinitely, this is not a viable path to parity.\n\nAt the current pace of progress, it would take 22 years for White women to reach parity —and it would take more than twice as long for women of color (Exhibit 4). Put another way, it would take 48 years for the representation of White women and women of color in senior leadership to reflect their share of the US population; this is true parity for all women. To achieve this, companies will need to maintain their current rate of progress, which means addressing weak spots in their pipelines: by finally fixing the broken rung, investing more resources in developing women leaders, and holding themselves accountable for more substantive progress in senior-leadership roles.\n\nImage description: A chart features a blue line representing a 50-year time frame, from 2020 to 2070, showing projections for achieving gender parity for all women in senior vice president and C-suite roles. Parity for White women is projected to be achieved by 2046, 22 years from 2024. Parity for women of color is projected to take 48 years to achieve, arriving in 2072. Footnote: Parity is defined as the representation of all women in senior vice president and C-suite roles based on workforce representation trends in the US Census, the current representation of women in entry-level roles, and the assumption that the pipeline and growing population of diverse women will attribute to greater representation of women at senior levels in future. This is 25% of total representation each for White women and women of color, respectively.

And employees recognize this: a majority think women have more opportunities to advance and point to companies’ increased efforts to make the workplace more equitable.\n\nOne point of progress is that today, almost all surveyed companies provide critical support for employees who are parents, caregivers, or managing health challenges—benefits that link to higher rates of happiness and employee retention. Benefits such as these are especially helpful to women, who are more likely than men to have caregiving responsibilities.\n\nWorkplace flexibility is another benefit that has expanded significantly in the past decade. Mostly in response to the pandemic, companies dramatically increased their hybrid and remote-work options. Eight in ten employees say flexibility has improved over the past ten years, and employees consistently point to greater productivity and reduced burnout as primary benefits. Flexibility is especially important to women, who report having more focused time to work when working remotely.\n\nTo view last year’s report, please visit Women in the Workplace 2023. For previous reports, please visit the archive.\n\nCompanies are also doing more to debias hiring practices and performance reviews but need to go further. When we look at five core practices for debiasing—developing clear evaluation criteria for hiring, before candidates are considered; offering bias training for hiring evaluators; aspiring to have diverse slates of similarly qualified candidates for open positions; developing clear evaluation criteria for performance reviews; and sending reminders to avoid bias during reviews—just one in four surveyed companies have adopted all of them. And the companies that have implemented the full array of practices tend to make the greatest strides in advancing women.\n\nAt the same time, companies have scaled back programs designed to advance women. While women face distinct barriers that these programs can help address, fewer companies say gender and racial diversity are priorities for the organization. Companies are reporting declines in career development, mentorship, and sponsorship programs geared toward women (Exhibit 5), as well as recruiting and internship programs focused on women. Relatively few companies track these programs’ outcomes, and in all cases, companies are investing in fewer programs designed to advance women of color.\n\nImage description: An arrow plot chart shows the share of respondents reporting diversity practices at their organization in 2017 and 2024. Practices that increased are represented by a cyan line extending from left to right, with the start of the line representing the 2017 value and a circle at the right-most end point representing the 2024 value. Practices that declined are shown as a dark gray line, extending from right to left, with the left-most end point representing the 2024 value. Declining practices include gender diversity (88% in 2017 to 78% in 2024), racial diversity (76% to 69%), managers encourage respectful and inclusive behavior on your team (97% to 95%), flexible work hours (85% to 77%), career development programs tailored to women (55% to 54%), formal sponsorship programs tailored to women (31% to 16%), and formal mentorship programs tailored to women (45% to 37%). Increasing practices include managers promote employees’ contributions to others (44% in 2017 to 64% in 2024), managers check in on your general well-being (68% to 82%), remote/hybrid work options (76% to 92%), clear and specific evaluation criteria are established before any candidates are considered during hiring process (72% to 76%), and there are clear and consistent criteria for evaluating performance (72% to 80%). Source: Women in the Workplace 2024, McKinsey & Company and LeanIn.Org End of image description.\n\nWhile companies are setting the right priorities, these priorities are not translating into manager action. Career advancement has long been a core expectation of managers, and now more companies are also asking managers to foster a culture of inclusion and employee well-being, which is critically important to organizational health. When managers invest in all of these areas, employees are less burned out, happier in their roles, and less likely to consider leaving their organizations. However, despite increased trainings for managers on these priorities, they are by and large not translating into better manager performance.\n\nBeyond the manager level, companies are doing more to activate employees as agents of change. Nearly all companies, for instance, offer bias or allyship training. But the increase in training programs does not appear to be translating into greater awareness or action. Employees are not markedly more likely to recognize bias against women or act as allies to women of color. For example, 28 percent of women today recognize microaggressions —comments and actions that undermine their credibility and leadership skills—against other women, nearly the same as the 33 percent in 2019, though still larger than the 11 percent of men who recognize microaggressions today.\n\nWhile companies have stepped up in some ways, progress has been uneven, and there are clear signs that more needs to be done. Employees universally agree that there has been less progress in how organizations handle microaggressions. And men are far more optimistic than women about how women’s opportunities have improved over the past decade.\n\nThe employee experience: Women’s experiences at work have not improved\n\nDespite an increase in representation at work, as well as expanded company efforts, the workplace has not gotten much better for women. Women today are no more optimistic than in the past about their gender’s impact on career advancement, even as they remain highly ambitious—and just as ambitious as men. For women of color, the obstacles feel even more insurmountable. Compared with six years ago, Asian, Black, and Latina women are more likely in 2024 to perceive their race as an obstacle to advancement.\n\nWomen’s concerns stem from what they’re up against in their day-to-day work. Women, and particularly women of color, are not getting enough support from their managers. Managers play a central role in women’s career advancement and daily work experiences, yet less than half of women report getting their managers’ help to advance or navigate work challenges. Women of color receive even less of this support than White women do. Given that employees with consistent manager support are more likely to be promoted, this very likely disadvantages women of color.\n\nConventional wisdom suggests that ageism, or unfair treatment based on a person’s age, predominantly affects older workers. In reality, it is most pronounced for young women. About half of women under 30 say their age played a role in missing out on opportunities at work, and they are almost twice as likely as younger men to field unwanted comments about their age.\n\nWhat’s more, women continue to confront microaggressions as often today as several years ago (Exhibit 6). Women, especially LGBTQ+ women and women with disabilities, remain more likely than men to experience microaggressions, which make it harder for women to speak up, take risks, and raise concerns at work. Compared with five years ago, women today are just as likely to experience “othering” microaggressions, which can erode a sense of belonging and make it harder for individuals to bring their whole selves to work. Again, LGBTQ+ women and women with disabilities report these demeaning interactions at the highest rates.\n\nImage description: Four graphs show the share of women reporting experiencing 1 of 4 types of microaggression in the workplace from 2018 to 2024. Any competence-based microaggression rose from 43% in 2018 to 62% in 2019, then fell to 42% in 2021, with subsequent numbers of 37% in 2022, 35% in 2023, and 54% in 2024.\n\nHaving judgment questioned in area of expertise rose from 36% in 2018 to 38% in 2019, then fell to 31% in 2021 and 2022 and 23% in 2023, before rising to 38% in 2024.\n\nBeing mistaken for someone at a much lower level was 20% 2018, 18% in 2019, 16% in 2022, 9% in 2023, and 18% in 2024.\n\nBeing interrupted or spoken over more than others decreased from 50% in 2019 to 29% in 2021 and 22% in 2023, before increasing to 39% in 2024. Source: Women in the Workplace 2024, McKinsey & Company and LeanIn.Org End of image description.\n\nMicroaggressions take a heavy toll. Women who experience them are more likely to feel burned out and to consider quitting their jobs and less likely to view their workplaces as equitable. By leaving microaggressions unchecked, companies risk losing talented employees and missing out on everything these women have to offer.\n\nAt the same time, inequity persists in the home as well. Four in ten women with partners say they are responsible for most or all of the household work, a number that has grown since 2016. By contrast, far more men over the same period say they share household responsibilities equally with partners, suggesting a growing gap in how women and men perceive their contributions at home. On top of this, younger women report doing the same amount of housework as older women, which also signals a lack of progress.\n\nRecommendations for companies: The next phase of work will require a bigger playbook\n\nBelow are the highlights of our recommendations for companies, and you can refer to the full report for more details.\n\nOver the past decade, companies have invested more energy and resources in women’s advancement. But the fragility of the progress in the pipeline highlights the need to do more. Despite companies’ efforts to activate managers and employees, the culture of work appears to be stuck. If one thing is clear, it’s that deep, systemic change—which requires reshaping people’s mindsets and behaviors—is hard to achieve and does not follow a linear path.\n\nThe next phase of change will require even more tenacity, creativity, and optimism, which starts with companies rekindling their commitments to equity and fairness that have gotten us this far. For senior leaders, this means continuing to champion this important work and challenging themselves and their organizations to do better.\n\nFor most companies, this will require implementing more of the right practices to help women advance. Our best practices checklist, developed after examining the adoption of key policies and practices and their links to better outcomes for all women, can help organizations identify gaps in their current offerings and opportunities to push further—as the companies making the biggest strides in advancing women have already done (Exhibit 7).\n\nImage description: A dot plot chart shows the share of respondents reporting equitable workplace practices at their organizations, comparing responses from top-performing organizations (cyan dots) with all others (white dots). Top performers outperform industry benchmarks for the representation of women and women of color from entry-level through senior vice president positions. The chart reveals significant variability in the percentage-point differences between the 2 groups. Key differences include the following: Top performers are 28 percentage points more likely than others to implement bias reminders sent to evaluators.\n\nTop performers are 12 percentage points more likely than others to implement flexible working hours.\n\nTop performers are 21 percentage points more likely than others to implement racial diversity as a strategic priority.\n\nTop performers are 17 percentage points more likely than others to say leadership plays an active role in shaping DEI strategy.\n\nTop performers are also more likely than others to track attrition and promotion rates for women and/or women of color (15 and 14 percentage-point difference, respectively) and provide menopause support, paid sick and family leave, and support for in vitro fertilization/fertility treatment and for adoption and/or surrogacy (23, 18, 13, and 12 percentage-point difference, respectively). Footnote 1: Across practices, program eligibility should be open to individuals from all backgrounds. The list of practices in this chart is nonexhaustive and includes only those where the differences between top-performing organizations and all other organizations are statistically significant.

Research shows that there are four building blocks to getting this right: ensuring that employees understand why a new practice is important, building employees’ skills so they can do their part, putting in place mechanisms that support and reinforce new practices, and ensuring that leaders role model the right behaviors. Many organizations follow some of these actions when introducing a new practice, but surprisingly few follow all of them.\n\nFinally, there are practical steps that companies can take to drive further progress in the areas we know are particularly important for advancing women and fostering inclusion: debiasing their hiring and promotions processes, inspiring and equipping employees to curb bias and practice allyship, and unlocking the power of managers to influence careers and team culture.\n\nThe research from this year, and the past ten, underscores the value of companies’ commitments to change. While women have made progress in some areas, there is still much work to do to create a workplace experience that is inclusive and equitable for everyone. Gender parity continues to be a long-term goal, but one that is achievable through an expanded playbook and greater involvement and buy-in from employees across the organization. Progress also begets progress. Celebrating the wins, even small ones, can help generate enthusiasm and build momentum throughout a company—and make a meaningful difference for all women at work.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nThe Time’s Up initiative was announced on January 1, 2018.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

He added that other countries “have taken advantage of us for many, many years.”\n\nEconomists’ estimates have been far more grim, with most predicting that the president’s sweeping tariffs and likely retaliation will slow U.S. economic growth, push up costs for consumers and make life difficult for businesses that depend on international supply chains.\n\nThe president’s measure is both consequential and complicated.\n\nWhat did the president just do?\n\nMr. Trump announced two big tariff plans that apply to most of the world. One component is a “base line” tariff of 10 percent that will apply broadly to nearly all U.S. imports, except for products coming from Canada and Mexico.\n\nThe second measure is what the president is calling a “reciprocal” tariff. That levy will apply to 57 countries that Mr. Trump says have high tariffs and other unfair economic practices that have hurt American exporters. He said this is a reciprocal tariff because it will match the way other countries treat the United States.\n\nBut the tariff that Mr. Trump announced is not actually based on other countries’ tariffs or other economic barriers to U.S. trade. The number is calculated based on the U.S. trade deficit, which is a measure of the difference between what the United States sells to a country and what it buys from it.\n\nThe reciprocal tariffs range from 1 percent to 40 percent and will be added to the 10 percent base line tariff.\n\nThe 10 percent tariffs will go into effect on Saturday, and the reciprocal rates next Wednesday.\n\nWhich countries were targeted most by the tariffs?\n\nThe tariffs put a heavy burden on some of America’s biggest trading partners, including China, Japan, Germany, India, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam.\n\nNotably, Canada and Mexico were not included. Mr. Trump hit those countries with a 25 percent tariff on many of their exports last month, though he also provided an exception for products that qualify for the trade agreement he signed in 2020, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. The countries are also subject to tariffs Mr. Trump has applied globally on cars, steel and aluminum, and the administration appears to have decided that America’s closest neighbors did not need further tariffs.\n\nBut the new tariffs will hit other allies with substantial levies. European goods will face a 20 percent tariff, Japanese goods will face 24 percent and South Korean products 26 percent.\n\nBecause of the way the tariff was calculated, Asian countries that send the United States a lot of exports but don’t buy much in return will see some of the highest rates.\n\nChinese exports face an extra 34 percent tariff. That is on top of a 20 percent tariff Mr. Trump applied in recent months and other levies from his first term. As a result, some products from China will face a tariff of 79 percent.\n\nVietnam — where many companies moved their factories after Mr. Trump put tariffs on China in his first term — will now face a 46 percent tariff on its exports, while Cambodian exports will be taxed at 49 percent.\n\nThe White House also did not apply tariffs to Russia, North Korea, Cuba and Belarus, arguing that these countries are already subject to heavy sanctions. But U.S. imports from Russia were $3 billion last year; small compared to many countries, but far larger than tiny countries like Lesotho and the Falkland Islands, which Mr. Trump chose to hit with substantial tariffs.\n\nWhat is the president’s goal?\n\nImage Mr. Trump said the tariffs will reverse decades of unfair treatment by the rest of the world and result in factories and jobs moving back to the United States. Credit... Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times\n\nThe president and his advisers say their goal is to make the tariffs so painful that they force companies to make their products in the United States. They argue that this will create more American jobs and push up wages.\n\n“If you want your tariff rate to be zero,” Mr. Trump said outside the White House on Wednesday, “then you build your product right here in America.”\n\nOne of the biggest questions is whether the president sees these tariffs as a negotiating tactic, and would be willing to remove them in return for concessions from other countries.\n\nThe administration has given mixed signals on that front. It seems unlikely that the president will remove the 10 percent base line tariff he has issued globally. And if the administration is truly looking for U.S. trade deficits with other countries to be eliminated, that may be difficult, if not impossible.\n\nBut in the executive order he signed, the president said that if countries eliminate their unfair trade practices, or the U.S. trade deficit with them drops, the reciprocal tariffs could be rolled back.\n\nHoward Lutnick, the commerce secretary, described other countries’ trade barriers as “the monster that needs to be slayed.”\n\n“Our teams are talking to all the great trading partners today,” Mr. Lutnick said Thursday on Bloomberg Television. “It is time for them to do deep soul-searching on how they treat us poorly and how to make it right.”\n\nHow did they come up with the numbers?\n\nMr. Trump said Wednesday that each nation’s tariff rate would be calculated based on “the combined rate of all their tariffs, non-monetary barriers and other forms of cheating.” But it turned out that their methodology revolved around something more straightforward: the gap between what America exports to a country and what it imports.\n\nThe White House put out a complicated-looking formula, but it boiled down to a simple ratio. Countries that send the U.S. more goods than they buy were deemed to have “unbalanced” trade and will face higher tariffs.\n\nThis formula doesn’t account for any comparative advantage, or the idea that countries trade goods because some are better at making some products than others, and that countries can trade to maximize their benefits. Instead, the administration’s point of view appears to be that any trade deficit is bad, and tariffs will be applied until it is eliminated.\n\nHow do the tariffs work?\n\nAs they go into effect over the next week, the tariffs will immediately increase the cost for importers bringing goods into the country. Typically, those importers are U.S. companies.\n\nFor example, if Walmart brings in a $10 shoe from Vietnam — which faces a 46 percent tariff — Walmart will owe $4.60 in additional tariffs to the U.S. government.\n\nIt’s less clear what happens next. Walmart could try to force the cost onto the Vietnamese shoe manufacturer, by telling it Walmart will pay less for the product. Walmart could cut into its own profit margins and absorb the cost of the tariff. Or, it could raise the price it sells shoes for at its stores, to make up the cost.\n\nEconomists found that, when Mr. Trump put tariffs on China in his first term, most of that cost was passed on to consumers. But economic studies found that the tariffs on steel were a bit different; only about half of those costs were passed on to customers.\n\nEstimates vary, but given the scale of Mr. Trump’s new tariffs, American households could see thousands of dollars of additional costs annually. An estimate released by the Yale Budget Lab, a research group, found that American households on average would pay an additional $2,100 because of the April 2 announcement, with poorer households paying a larger share of their income.\n\nThe particularly high tariffs that the Trump administration applied to many Asian countries means that the price of many consumer items will likely increase, including shoes, clothing and electronics.\n\nThe government will earn a lot more revenue from tariffs that the Trump administration has promised to channel into tax cuts. The value of tariffs for all the goods imported by the United States last year was $78 billion. With the new tariffs announced on Wednesday, the figure would skyrocket to more than $1 trillion, according to an analysis by Trade Partnership Worldwide, a research firm based in Washington.\n\nWhat happens next with the economy?\n\nThe tariff announcement triggered a global meltdown in stock markets, indicating that investors see it as significantly harmful for listed companies.\n\nIt is not yet clear whether, or how, other countries will retaliate. But if they impose their own tariffs on U.S. products, that will likely hurt U.S. exporters and could spark escalating trade wars.\n\nMany analysts quickly downgraded their forecasts for economic growth, saying that tariffs would push up prices for consumers and costs for businesses, slowing demand and economic activity.\n\nNancy Lazar, chief global economist at Piper Sandler, estimated the U.S. economy might contract 1 percent in the second quarter. She had previously expected a flat quarter. “It’s an immediate hit to the economy,” she said.\n\nEconomists at Fitch Ratings said in a note Thursday that the tariffs had significantly raised the risk for a recession in the United States. It said that tariffs would result in higher consumer prices that would squeeze real wages and weigh on consumer spending.\n\nThe tariffs would also lead to lower corporate profits, which, along with policy uncertainty, would drag on business investment in the United States. Altogether, the effect would “likely outweigh the benefits U.S. companies might gain from increased protection against foreign competition,” Fitch economists said.\n\nLazaro Gamio and Colby Smith contributed reporting.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nThe S&P 500 fell below its 200-day moving average on Monday.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

She previously worked at Business Insider covering the military and global conflicts.\n\nThe short tenure of UK Prime Minister Liz Truss, seen here at a press conference on October 14, has been dominated by economic and political instability. Daniel Leal-WPA/Getty Images\n\nThe United Kingdom, not to mention the Conservative Party currently running it, is having a bumpy fall. So bumpy, in fact, that new prime minister Liz Truss has announced she will resign, after only six weeks in office.\n\n“I cannot deliver the mandate on which I was elected,” she said Thursday in brief remarks.\n\nTruss’s rapid fall from power came after she introduced Trussonomics, a plan for massive tax cuts aimed at Britain’s wealthiest, and then reversed course and apologized for all the economic turmoil the proposal created.\n\nThat proposed “mini budget,” which also included a rollback of corporate tax hikes and a break on planned cost increases for national insurance, had sent the British financial markets into a weeks-long tailspin. On top of a deepening cost-of-living crisis, Truss’s plan sent foreign investors fleeing from the British economy, driving the country’s currency to a record-low value against the dollar.\n\nThat economic chaos precipitated a political crisis: Truss’s grip on power slipped fast, as did public esteem for her Conservative Party.\n\nTruss had spent the past week trying to steady the economy and her premiership. On Monday, the UK’s new Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt announced a near-complete reversal of Trussonomics. That day, Truss told the BBC she would “accept responsibility and say sorry for the mistakes that have been made” and told interviewer Chris Mason that she intended to lead the Conservative Party through the next general election.\n\nHowever, the damage had already been done: She became the least popular prime minister in the history of polling. The Conservatives, or Tories as they’re commonly known, announced they will select their next leader — and therefore leader of the UK — by next Friday.\n\nIt’s an exceptionally fast timeline for the contest, which will be decided by Conservative members of Parliament and party members only. Quite a few names are already being floated, including some familiar ones: Rishi Sunak, who lost to Truss in the most recent contest, sure, but also Boris Johnson, who’s already being encouraged to return by his supporters.\n\nBut lurking underneath the immediate questions about leadership are bigger ones, about how much damage has been done to the Conservative Party as a whole.\n\n“This is end of times for the Conservatives unless they can get themselves back to some position of competence and some position of stability, which at the moment is looking very, very difficult,” Matthew Goodwin, a professor of politics at the University of Kent, told Vox earlier this week.\n\nTruss’s signature policy became her downfall\n\nTruss’s political crisis started with an economic one.\n\nOn September 23, Truss’s former chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng introduced the UK’s biggest tax cuts in 50 years, estimated at about 45 billion pounds over five years. The following Monday, investors soundly rejected the new economic plan, dubbed “Trussonomics” in reference to Reaganomics, the supply-side economic policies passed under Ronald Reagan in the 1980s. Global markets responded to the policy by selling off UK-backed assets and pushing the UK’s currency, the pound, to a valuation of $1.03, its lowest-ever value against the dollar, before it inched up later in the week.\n\nThe announcement of Kwarteng and Truss’s new plan also triggered a sell-off in government bonds — typically considered quite safe investments — which was so extreme that the Bank of England, the UK’s central bank, stepped in and purchased 65 billion pounds worth of bonds “to restore orderly market conditions” and float the country’s pension scheme.\n\nOne reason Trussonomics was so unnerving was the idea that the tax cuts would be financed by further borrowing. The UK already has a significant public debt burden — without new taxes, the UK’s Office for Budget Responsibility warned, public debt would balloon to 320 percent of Britain’s GDP in 50 years, up from 96 percent, or 2.4 trillion pounds, now.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) agreed, issuing an astonishing and nearly unprecedented rebuke against the tax cuts, which devalued the pound even further. “The nature of the UK measures will likely increase inequality,” the global lender said, urging the government to “consider ways to provide support that [are] more targeted and reevaluate the tax measures, especially those that benefit high-income earners.”\n\nIn the past week, Truss’s government had been trying to stanch the bleeding. Truss fired Kwarteng on October 14 and on Monday, Hunt, aiming to ease the economic crisis, made public the reversal of Truss’s economic plan, weeks earlier than planned.\n\n“We are a country that funds our promises and pays our debts,” Hunt said, rebuking Truss and Kwarteng’s intention to pay for their tax cuts by borrowing, and the very real possibility that their plan would eventually necessitate a cut in social services.\n\nHunt defended the reversal in Parliament later that day, with Truss sitting behind him, her silence telegraphing the rapid decline of her power and stature.\n\nThat day, Mark Blyth, director of the William Rhodes Center for International Economics and Finance at Brown University, told Vox via email that “she’s in charge, but she is clearly not in charge.” Hunt “defenestrated her. He is running the country. It’s like the shittiest Game of Thrones episode ever.”\n\nTruss’s tax cuts worked against her own government — and Conservative voters\n\nTruss inherited a bad economy and cost-of-living crisis from her predecessor. But “there might never have been a good time to push through tax cuts,” Nikhil Sanghani, managing director for research at the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (OMFIF), told Vox in an earlier interview.\n\nOn top of high inflation caused in part by the Covid-19 stimulus, stagnant wages, interest rate increases to combat the inflation, a weaker-than-expected economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic, and outrageous energy prices caused by Russia’s war in Ukraine amid one of the hottest summers on record, Truss’s tax plan was, he said, “the nail in the coffin in terms of, ‘Will there be a recession?’”\n\nTruss and Kwarteng proposed the policy as a way to jump-start the sluggish economy — essentially, trickle-down economics in the 21st century. But adding money to the pockets of the rich and large corporations with the assumption that they’ll use it in alignment with policy directives flies in the face of widely accepted economic theory. Moreover, injecting more money into an economy already suffering from an inflation crisis is illogical and contrary to the efforts of the Bank of England, which has raised interest rates seven times since December to help reduce the rate of inflation — now around 10 percent.\n\nTaxing income is another way to tackle inflation and provides the government with revenue to fund its programs, like pensions for the aging population and the National Health Service. Instead, the government “decide[d] to do massive tax cuts that may not be even stimulatory given that the skew on who gets the money makes the Trump tax cuts look like socialism,” Blyth said. “The people who get all the money will not spend it because they are already rich, and the people who need money to spend will get next to nothing and will then get slammed with a doubling of energy bills and a huge rise in their mortgage costs.”\n\nAlthough the government’s policy reversal seems to have rallied markets, it’s unclear what the lasting effect will be, particularly since there are so many mitigating factors like global inflation and the war in Ukraine straining the economy. It has, however, clearly highlighted that the Conservative Party is in trouble.\n\nAnd it’s not clear how the Tories will navigate that.\n\nWhat happens next with the prime minister contest — and the Conservative Party?\n\nThe future of the Conservative Party is in doubt, and its issues are a lot bigger than Truss.\n\nSome questions will be resolved in the next week. The party’s steering committee is meeting Thursday evening to hammer out the rules for the next leadership contest, and the party has promised it will all be wrapped up by October 28. (The last contest, after Johnson announced his resignation, took two months to complete.) In the final stage, Tory Party members may vote online.\n\nLikely contenders include Rishi Sunak, the former chancellor of the exchequer who went head-to-head with Truss last time; and Penny Mordaunt, another minister who was popular among her fellow conservative members of Parliament in the earlier stages of the previous contest. And though Hunt may run, and snap polling suggests that Britons approve of his decision to overturn Truss’s policies, that doesn’t mean he’s the obvious choice to replace Truss, since most voters won’t really know who he is or have had time to form an opinion on his policies.\n\nThere’s also already speculation — bolstered by calls from his allies — that Johnson may try to stage a return.\n\nBut whoever the next leader is will have to navigate longer-term questions about the Tories’ identity — and their appeal to the UK more broadly.\n\nTruss’s fall is partially of her own doing, but she was also operating within a party that‘s failed to coalesce under a united vision for the country post-Brexit. The Conservatives won their historic majority in 2019 by bringing new voters into the party. But without the unifying goal of getting Brexit done, the party has a serious issue with internal factionalization.\n\n“Conservatives are now very divided,” Goodwin said. “They have very different views on where they want to take the country. This is not like the US Republican Party that has been largely, almost completely realigned around [a] Trumpist message. This is a much more factional Conservative Party, with different wings — there’s a Boris Johnson wing, there’s a Liz Truss wing, there’s a One Nation liberal conservative wing, and that makes it difficult for the party to find a figure that everybody can agree on, to find policies that everyone can agree on.”\n\nNow public opinion is at an all-time low for Truss and her party. YouGov polls over the past nine months have put Labour firmly in the lead for the next government. After a series of mishandled crises under Tory leadership — from a rocky Brexit to former Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Covid-19 scandals and ensuing resignation to the cost-of-living and currency crises now — it seems that voters are ready to boot the Conservative Party.\n\nThe Tories have a constitutional mandate for several more years, but opposition leaders are clamoring for an early election amid this turmoil.\n\nLabour’s (also admittedly unpopular) leader Keir Starmer said his party had a platform ready to go if needed.\n\n“There’s a manifesto that is going to be ready whenever an election is called,” he said Thursday. “We’ve moved our teams onto a general election footing. And I’ve got in place all the grids I need for a general election. So we’re very, very prepared, should there be a general election.”\n\nTruss, at least, won’t be leading the Conservatives then — her unpopularity rivals that of only one other Briton, according to Goodwin. “She’s basically in what I would call Prince Andrew territory,” he said, referencing the disgraced brother of King Charles III, who was caught up in the Jeffrey Epstein scandal. “And you generally don’t tend to come back from Prince Andrew territory.”\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nJeremy Hunt reversed most mini-budget policies three weeks later.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Being that the launch of their OS comes at a time where the company is facing a ban from America, and potential complete restriction from using Operating Systems like Android by Google, and Windows by Microsoft, most people are seeing Huawei’s announcement as a way of them showing the world they’re ready for any eventualities.\n\nThe first product running HarmonyOS is a TV. It isn’t your normal smart TV. It even has an AI powered pop-up selfie camera.\n\nWhen you think of it, Huawei isn’t launching a TV just for the fun of showing off their new OS. No. Many smartphone companies are currently getting into the TV business. We’ve seen Xiaomi with their incredibly priced TVs, and more recently OnePlus has been teasing their upcoming TV. Unlike the others Huawei’s Honor TV won’t be running Android TV OS.\n\nHonor Vision features a 4K Ultra-HD 55-inch LCD TV with a maximum brightness of 400 nits. The screen to body ratio is 94% because of the extra tiny bezels, but somehow there’s six 10-watt speakers and support for wireless communication with Bluetooth 5.0. There is three HDMI 2.0 inputs, one HDMI Arc port, one USB 2.0 jack, an AV port, DTMB, S/PDIF and, an Ethernet connector.\n\nLike Google Fuchsia OS, HarmonyOS is a microkernel-based OS and can run on multiple device types including smartwatches, televisions, smart displays, car kits, and smartphones.\n\nWith the TV you get Honor Magic allowing you to link your phone, and control the TV using it. There’s ability to cast your phone to the screen using DLNA or Miracast standards. The low latency, Huawei say, should allow for screen share gaming from phone to screen. Plus with Huawei Share, one can send a 600MB file in just 20 seconds.\n\nFor a new OS built from the ground up, Huawei’s HarmonyOS is totally ready with a lot of smart features. It is meant to be a full smart hub experience:\n\nYou can make video calls directly from it using the pop-up selfie camera\n\nFace recognition for kids where it sets brightness and reduces blue light emission\n\nBuilt-in YoYo Smart Assistant for voice commands, and setting of routines\n\nVideo bell integration to see who’s at the door.\n\nFamily Message board to share important notices with people in the house\n\nStreaming assistant to help you find streaming platforms for content you want\n\nThe TV is already on sale in China starting at ~$537 for the 16GB variant and $680 for the 32GB model. Of course, it probably won’t be selling outside China any time soon.\n\nI am impressed with Huawei’s work on a brand new OS. I am happy they took the open source road, and I believe they can get more developers on board much faster than other companies like Microsoft who tried and failed. The good thing (or bad, depending on how you view it) is this: If America completely bans Huawei from accessing Android and Windows and other stuff, China can retaliate forcing all Chinese companies to get an alternative, and Huawei has an alternative that’s ready.\n\nRelated\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nHuawei stated HarmonyOS will debut first on the Honor Smart Screen and Huawei TVs.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert at causal reasoning."}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n### CONTEXT\n[Doc 1]\nTitle: August 22, 2021\nContent: A week after the Taliban took control of Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, as the U.S. was withdrawing the forces that have been in the country since 2001, the initial chaos created by the Taliban’s rapid sweep across the country has simmered down into what is at least a temporary pattern.\n\nWe knew there was a good chance that the Taliban would regain control of the country when we left, although that was not a foregone conclusion. The former president, Donald Trump, recognized that the American people were tired of the ongoing war in Afghanistan, which was approaching its 20th year, and in February 2020, his administration negotiated with the Taliban to enable the U.S. to withdraw. In exchange for the release of 5000 Taliban fighters and the promise that the U.S. would withdraw within the next 14 months, the Taliban agreed not to attack U.S. soldiers.\n\nTrump’s dislike of the war in Afghanistan reflected the unpopularity of the long engagement, which by 2020 was ill defined. The war had begun in 2001, after terrorists affiliated with al-Qaeda attacked the United States on September 11 of that year. Taliban leaders in control of Afghanistan sheltered al-Qaeda, and after the attacks, the U.S. president, George W. Bush, demanded that Afghanistan hand over the terrorist leader believed to be behind the terrorist attack on the U.S: Osama bin Laden. In October, after Taliban leaders refused, the U.S. launched a bombing campaign.\n\nThat campaign was successful enough that in December 2001 the Taliban offered to surrender. But the U.S. rejected that surrender, determined by then to eradicate the extremist group and fill the vacuum of its collapse with a new, pro-American government. Al-Qaeda leader bin Laden escaped from Afghanistan to Pakistan, and the U.S. project in Afghanistan turned from an anti-terrorism mission into an effort to rebuild the Afghan government into a modern democracy.\n\nBy 2002 the Bush administration was articulating a new doctrine in foreign policy, arguing that the U.S. had a right to strike preemptively against countries that harbor terrorists. In 2003, under this doctrine, the U.S. launched a war on Iraq, which diverted money, troops, and attention from Afghanistan. The Taliban regrouped and began to regain the territory it had lost after the U.S. first began its bombing campaign in 2001.\n\nBy 2005, Bush administration officials privately worried the war in Afghanistan could not be won on its current terms, especially with the U.S. focused on Iraq. Then, when he took office in 2009, President Barack Obama turned his attention back to Afghanistan. He threw more troops into that country, bringing their numbers close to 100,000. In 2011, the U.S. military located bin Laden in Abbottabad, Pakistan, and launched a raid on the compound where he was hiding, killing him. By 2014, Obama had drawn troops in Afghanistan down to about 11,000, and in December of that year, he announced that the mission of the war—weakening the Taliban and capturing bin Laden—had been accomplished, and thus the war was over. The troops would come home.\n\nBut, of course, they didn’t, leaving Trump to develop his own policy. But his administration’s approach to the chaos in that country was different than his predecessor’s. By negotiating with the Taliban and excluding the Afghan government the U.S. had been supporting, the Trump team essentially accepted that the Taliban were the most important party in Afghanistan. The agreement itself reflected the oddity of the negotiations. Each clause referring to the Taliban began: “The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan which is not recognized by the United States as a state and is known as the Taliban will….”\n\nIt was immediately clear that the Taliban was not living up to its side of the bargain. Although it did stop attacking U.S. troops, It began to escalate violence in Afghanistan itself, assassinated political opponents, and maintained ties to al-Qaeda. Nonetheless, the Trump administration put pressure on the leaders of the Afghan government to release the 5000 Taliban prisoners, and they eventually did. Before Biden took office, Trump dropped the U.S. troop engagement in Afghanistan from about 13,000 to about 2500.\n\nWhen he took office, Biden had to decide whether to follow Trump’s path or to push back on the Taliban on the grounds they were not honoring the agreement Trump’s people had hammered out. Biden himself wanted to get out of the war. At the same time, he recognized that fighting the Taliban again would mean throwing more troops back into Afghanistan, and that the U.S. would again begin to take casualties. He opted to get the troops out, but extended the deadline to September 11, 2021, the twentieth anniversary of the initial attack. (Former president Trump complained that the troops should come out faster.)\n\nWhat Biden did not foresee was the speed with which the Taliban would retake control of the country. It swept over the regional capitals and then Kabul in about nine days in mid-August with barely a shot fired, and the head of the Afghan government fled the country, leaving it in chaos.\n\nThat speed left the U.S. flatfooted. Afghans who had been part of the government or who had helped the U.S. and its allies rushed to the airport to try to escape. In the pandemonium of that first day, up to seven people were killed; two people appear to have clung to a U.S. military plane as it took off, falling to their deaths.\n\nAnd yet, the Taliban, so far, has promised amnesty for its former opponents and limited rights for women. It has its own problems, as the Afghan government has been supported for the previous 20 years by foreign money, including a large percentage from the U.S. Not only has that money dried up as foreign countries refuse to back the Taliban, but also Biden has put sanctions on Afghanistan and also on some Pakistanis suspected of funding the Taliban. At the same time it appears that no other major sponsor, like Russia or China, has stepped in to fill the vacuum left by U.S. money, leaving the Taliban fishing for whatever goodwill it can find.\n\nYesterday, Josh Marshall of Talking Points Memo flagged tweets showing that members of the Afghan government, including the brother of the president who fled, are in what appear from the photos posted on Twitter to be relaxed talks about forming a new government. Other factions in Afghanistan would like to stop this from happening, and today Biden’s national security adviser Jake Sullivan warned that ISIS-K, another extremist group, is threatening to attack the airport to destabilize the Taliban.\n\nMeanwhile, there are 10,000 people crowded into that airport, and U.S. evacuations continue. The Kabul airport is secure—for now—and the U.S. military has created a larger perimeter around it for protection. The U.S. government has asked Americans in Afghanistan to shelter in place until they can be moved out safely; the Qatari ambassador to Afghanistan has been escorting groups of them to the airport. Evacuations have been slower than hoped because of backlogs at the next stage of the journey, but the government has enlisted the help of 18 commercial airlines to move those passengers forward, leaving room for new evacuees.\n\nYesterday, about 7800 evacuees left the Kabul airport. About 28,000 have been evacuated since August 14.\n\nInterestingly, much of the U.S. media is describing this scenario as a disaster for President Biden. Yet, on CNN this morning, Matthew Dowd, who was the chief strategist for the Bush-Cheney ticket in 2004, noted that more than 20,000 people have been evacuated from Afghanistan without a single loss of an American life, while in the same period of time, 5000 Americans have died from Covid-19 and 500 have died from gunshots.\n\n—-\n\nNotes:\n\nhttps://www.npr.org/2020/02/29/810537586/u-s-signs-peace-deal-with-taliban-after-nearly-2-decades-of-war-in-afghanistan\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2021/08/12/obama-afghan-war-ending-afghanistan-papers-book-excerpt/\n\nhttps://www.factcheck.org/2021/08/timeline-of-u-s-withdrawal-from-afghanistan/\n\nhttps://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/you-wouldnt-know-it-from-the-us-news-coverage-but\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/16/kabul-airport-chaos-and-panic-as-afghans-and-foreigners-attempt-to-flee-the-capital\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2021/08/22/afghanistan-biden-evacuations/\n\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2021/08/21/politics/kabul-airport-terror-warning/index.html\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/08/17/treasury-taliban-money-afghanistan/\n\nShare\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nOn August 15, 2021, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani fled the country.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Wildfire Service has warned today’s strong winds expected across much of the province could lead to more extreme wildfire activity.\n\nGusts are predicted to reach up to 60-kilometres per hour in areas east of the Rockies, while southern B.C. is expected to remain warm and dry.\n\nThe agency said thundershowers and lightning are forecast for the eastern corners of the province, with potential for dry lightning into Wednesday.\n\nForests Minister Ravi Parmar visited the province’s northeast this week to assess the wildfire situation. He said in Fort St John Tuesday, July 8, that ongoing drought has severely impacted the region and led to more extreme and long-lasting wildfires.\n\nParmar flew over the area in a helicopter along with Northern Rockies Mayor Rob Fraser and Fort Nelson First Nation Chief Archie Harold, calling it “a moving experience.”\n\nParmar said over 7000 square kilometres have burned in the Prince George Fire Centre region since last month, and it’s estimated 30 per cent of forested areas in the region will be impacted this year.\n\n“People have endured not just the physical threat of fires, but the emotional toll of displacement, smoke and uncertainty,” said Parmar. “What I’ve seen is not just the devastation, but resilience.”\n\nTaylor Colman, a Fire Information Officer for BCWS said drought conditions in the northeast are making it “really, really challenging” for firefighters to respond to fires. She said fires are burning underground in the root systems of trees.\n\n“It’s not as simple as just extinguishing what’s on the surface. Crews are having to really dig deep to fight the fires in that area,” said Coleman.\n\nToday’s BCWS dashboard said there were more than 70 active fires across the province, including 16 classified as out-of-control.\n\nThe wildfire service said Monday, July 7, it was rescinding a campfire ban in the Fort Nelson Forest District, saying fire danger ratings have dropped due to recent rainfall and cooler temperatures. However, Coleman said the campfire ban could be reinstated if necessary.\n\nLarger Category 2 and Category 3 open fires are still prohibited in the Prince George, Stuart Nechako, Mackenzie, Peace, and Fort Nelson forest districts.\n\nParmar also said he had spoken to Lytton Mayor Denise O’Connor and Lytton First Nation Chief Niakia Hanna about the out-of-control Izman Creek fire, burning about 14-kilometres north of Lytton.\n\nThe fire erupted around the fourth anniversary of the 2021 wildfire that devastated the area and left two people dead.\n\n“My heart goes out to that community that’s faced so many challenges these last number of years,” said Parmar.\n\nThe Izman Creek fire has grown to more than 2.4 square-kilometres, though the BCWS said there was no growth overnight between Monday and Tuesday.\n\nThe Thompson-Nicola Regional District issued an evacuation order last week for an area of Highway 12, saying three properties are affected. The Lytton First Nation has also issued an evacuation alert, meaning residents should be ready to leave at a moment’s notice.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nQuebec planes and B.C. helicopters are battling the L.A. wildfires.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA. The Park Fire ignited in July in Northern California.\nB. The Eaton fire burned over 14,000 acres, destroyed thousands of homes, and displaced tens of thousands.\nC. Fire crews contained several fires, including the Kenneth, Lidia, Sunset, Auto, Hurst, Archer, and San Diego area fires.\nD.

Due to an “external security threat,” no one could enter or exit the Capitol complex, the recording said.\n\nProtesters were also seen inside the Senate chamber. One got up on the dais and yelled “Trump won that election.”\n\nSeveral dozen are roaming through the halls, yelling “Where are they?” according to a pool report.\n\nCongressional leaders were whisked to safety.

Our 20 years of sacrifice worked.\"\n\nIn Washington, Gen. Frank McKenzie, head of U.S. Central Command, announced the completion of America's longest war and the evacuation effort, saying the last planes took off from Kabul airport at 3:29 p.m. EDT — one minute before midnight Monday in Kabul.\n\n\"We did not get everybody out that we wanted to get out,\" he said.\n\nWith its last troops gone, the U.S. ended its 20-year war with the Taliban back in power. Many Afghans remain fearful of their rule or of further instability, and there have been sporadic reports of killings and other abuses in areas under Taliban control despite the group's pledges to restore peace and security.\n\n\"American soldiers left the Kabul airport, and our nation got its full independence,\" Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said early Tuesday.\n\nThe U.S. and its allies invaded Afghanistan shortly after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attack on the United States, which al-Qaida orchestrated while sheltering under Taliban rule. The invasion drove the Taliban from power in a matter of weeks and scattered Osama bin Laden and other top al-Qaida leaders.\n\nThe U.S. and its allies launched an ambitious effort to rebuild Afghanistan after decades of war, investing billions of dollars in a Western-style government and security forces. Women, who had been largely confined to their homes under the Taliban's hard-line rule, benefited from access to education and came to assume prominent roles in public life.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBut the Taliban never went away.\n\nIn the coming years, as the U.S. focused on another troubled war in Iraq and the Afghan government became mired in corruption, the Taliban regrouped in the countryside and in neighboring Pakistan. In recent years, they seized large parts of rural Afghanistan and carried out near-daily assaults on Afghan security forces.\n\nEager to end the war, the Trump administration signed a peace deal with the Taliban in February 2020 that paved the way for the withdrawal. President Joe Biden extended the deadline from May to August and continued with the pullout despite the Taliban's rapid blitz across the country earlier this month.\n\nNow the Taliban control all of Afghanistan except for the mountainous Panjshir province, where a few thousand local fighters and remnants of Afghanistan's collapsed security forces have pledged to resist them. The Taliban say they are seeking a peaceful resolution there.\n\nThey face much graver challenges now that they govern one of the poorest and most war-ravaged nations on Earth.\n\nIn recent days Afghans have lined up outside banks as an economic crisis that predates the Taliban takeover worsens. A string of attacks by the Islamic State extremist group's local affiliate, including a barrage of rockets fired at the airport Monday, shows the security challenges the Taliban face.\n\nOn Thursday, an Islamic State suicide attack at an airport gate killed at least 169 Afghans and 13 U.S. service members. The extremist group is far more radical than the Taliban, and the two groups have fought each other before. The Taliban say they will prevent Afghanistan from again being used as a base for terror attacks, a pledge that will likely be tested soon.\n\nMcKenzie said the Taliban were \"significantly helpful\" in enabling the airlift but will have difficulty securing Kabul in the coming days, not least because of the threat they face from IS. He said the Taliban had freed IS fighters from prisons, swelling their ranks to an estimated 2,000.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"Now they are going to be able to reap what they sowed,\" the American general said.\n\nMany Afghans fear the Taliban themselves, who governed the country under a harsh interpretation of Islamic law from 1996 until 2001. In those years they banned television and music, barred women from attending school or working outside the home, and carried out public executions.\n\nThe Taliban have sought to project a more moderate image since the takeover. They say women will be able to attend school and work, and have renounced any revenge attacks on Afghans who worked with the former government, the U.S. or its allies.\n\nMany Afghans are deeply skeptical of such promises, and fear of the Taliban's rule drove tens of thousands to flee the country over the past two weeks. Thousands more waited in vain outside the airport, many of them standing for hours in a sewage canal.\n\nThe Kabul international airport had been one of the few ways out. At one point people flooded onto the tarmac and seven fell to their deaths after clinging to a plane that was taking off. Another seven died in a stampede of people outside an airport gate.\n\nThe Taliban have said they will allow normal travel, but it is unclear how they will run the airport and which commercial carriers will begin flying in, given security concerns.\n\nQatar, a close U.S. ally that has long hosted a Taliban political office, has been taking part in negotiations about operations at the airport with Afghan and international parties, mainly the U.S. and Turkey. Qatari Assistant Foreign Minister Lolwa al-Khater said its main priority is restoring regular operations while maintaining security at the airport.\n\nThe last known U.S. military operation in Afghanistan came Sunday, when American officials said a drone strike blew up a vehicle carrying IS suicide bombers who were planning to attack the airport.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBut like so much about the Afghanistan war, it may not have gone as planned.\n\nRelatives of those killed in Sunday's strike said it killed civilians who had nothing to do with the extremist group.\n\nNajibullah Ismailzada said his brother-in-law, Zemarai Ahmadi, had just arrived home from his job working with a Korean charity. As he drove into the garage, his children came out to greet him, and that is when the missile struck.\n\n\"We lost 10 members of our family,\" Ismailzada said, including six children raging in age from 2 to 8. He said another relative, Naser Nejrabi, who was a former soldier in the Afghan army and a former interpreter for the U.S. military, also was killed, along with two teenagers.\n\nU.S. officials have acknowledged the reports of civilian casualties without confirming them.\n\nHours before the withdrawal was complete, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the U.S. military takes steps to avoid civilian casualties when carrying out targeted strikes.\n\n\"Of course, the loss of life from anywhere is horrible, and it impacts families no matter where they're living, in the United States or around the world,\" she said.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nTaliban fighters celebrated following the U.S. departure.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

The development has two sides, one with open source and the other being propriety models. DeepSeek-R1, an open-source AI model developed by DeepSeek-AI, a Chinese research company, exemplifies this trend. Its emergence has challenged the dominance of proprietary models such as OpenAI’s o1, sparking discussions on cost efficiency, open-source innovation, and global technological leadership in AI. Let’s delve into the development, capabilities, and implications of DeepSeek-R1 while comparing it with OpenAI’s o1 system, considering the contributions of both spaces.\n\nDeepSeek-R1 is the great output of DeepSeek-AI’s innovative efforts in open-source LLMs to enhance reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning (RL). The model’s development significantly departs from traditional AI training methods that rely heavily on supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Instead, DeepSeek-R1 employs a multi-stage pipeline combining cold-start, RL, and supervised data to create a model capable of advanced reasoning.\n\nThe Development Process\n\nDeepSeek-R1 leverages a unique multi-stage training process to achieve advanced reasoning capabilities. It builds on its predecessor, DeepSeek-R1-Zero, which employed pure RL without relying on SFT. While DeepSeek-R1-Zero demonstrated remarkable capabilities in reasoning benchmarks, it faced challenges such as poor readability and language inconsistencies. DeepSeek-R1 adopted a more structured approach to address these limitations, integrating cold-start data, reasoning-oriented RL, and SFT.\n\nThe development began with collecting thousands of high-quality examples of long Chains of Thought (CoT), a foundation for fine-tuning the DeepSeek-V3-Base model. This cold-start phase emphasized readability and coherence, ensuring outputs were user-friendly. The model was then subjected to a reasoning-oriented RL process using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). This innovative algorithm enhances learning efficiency by estimating rewards based on group scores rather than using a traditional critic model. This stage significantly improved the model’s reasoning capabilities, particularly in math, coding, and logic-intensive tasks. Following RL convergence, DeepSeek-R1 underwent SFT using a dataset of approximately 800,000 samples, including reasoning and non-reasoning tasks. This process broadened the model’s general-purpose capabilities and enhanced its performance across benchmarks. Also, the reasoning capabilities were distilled into smaller models, such as Qwen and Llama, enabling the deployment of high-performance AI in computationally efficient forms.\n\nTechnical Excellence and Benchmark Performance\n\nDeepSeek-R1 has established itself as a formidable AI model, excelling in benchmarks across multiple domains. Some of its key performance highlights include:\n\nMathematics: The model achieved a Pass@1 score of 97.3% on the MATH-500 benchmark, comparable to OpenAI’s o1-1217. This result underscores its ability to handle complex problem-solving tasks. Coding: On the Codeforces platform, DeepSeek-R1 achieved an Elo rating of 2029, placing it in the top percentile of participants. It also outperformed other models in benchmarks like SWE Verified and LiveCodeBench, solidifying its position as a reliable tool for software development. Reasoning Benchmarks: DeepSeek-R1 achieved a Pass@1, scoring 71.5% on GPQA Diamond and 79.8% on AIME 2024, demonstrating its advanced reasoning capabilities. Its novel use of CoT reasoning and RL achieved these results. Creative Tasks: DeepSeek-R1 excelled in creative and general question-answering tasks beyond technical domains, achieving an 87.6% win rate on AlpacaEval 2.0 and 92.3% on ArenaHard.\n\nKey Features of DeepSeek-R1 include:\n\nArchitecture: DeepSeek-R1 utilizes a Mixture of Experts (MoE) design with 671 billion parameters, activating only 37 billion parameters per forward pass. This structure allows for efficient computation and scalability, making it suitable for local execution on consumer-grade hardware.\n\nTraining Methodology: Unlike traditional models that rely on supervised fine-tuning, DeepSeek-R1 employs an RL-based training approach. This enables the model to autonomously develop advanced reasoning capabilities, including CoT reasoning and self-verification.\n\nPerformance Metrics: Initial benchmarks indicate that DeepSeek-R1 excels in various areas: MATH-500 (Pass@1): 97.3%, surpassing OpenAI’s o1 which achieved 96.4%. Codeforces Rating: Close competition with OpenAI’s top ratings (2029 vs. 2061). C-Eval (Chinese Benchmarks): Achieving a record accuracy of 91.8%.\n\nCost Efficiency: DeepSeek-R1 is reported to deliver performance comparable to OpenAI’s o1 at approximately 95% lower cost, which could significantly alter the economic landscape of AI development and deployment.\n\nOpenAI’s o1 models are known for their state-of-the-art reasoning and problem-solving abilities. They were developed by focusing on large-scale SFT and RL to refine their reasoning capabilities. The o1 series excels at CoT reasoning, which involves breaking down complex and detailed tasks into manageable steps. This approach has led to exceptional mathematics, coding, and scientific reasoning performance.\n\nA main strength of the o1 series is its focus on safety and compliance. OpenAI has implemented rigorous safety protocols, including external red-teaming exercises and ethical evaluations, to minimize risks associated with harmful outputs. These measures ensure the models align with ethical guidelines, making them suitable for high-stakes applications. Also, the o1 series is highly adaptable, excelling in diverse applications ranging from creative writing and conversational AI to multi-step problem-solving.\n\nModel Variants: The o1 family includes three versions: o1: The full version with advanced capabilities. o1-mini: A smaller, more efficient model optimized for speed while maintaining strong performance. o1 pro mode: The most powerful variant, utilizing additional computing resources for enhanced performance.\n\nReasoning Capabilities: The o1 models are optimized for complex reasoning tasks and demonstrate significant improvements over previous models. They are particularly strong in STEM applications, where they can perform at levels comparable to PhD students on challenging benchmark tasks.\n\nPerformance Benchmarks: On the American Invitational Mathematics Examination (AIME), the o1 pro mode scored 86%, significantly outperforming the standard o1, which scored 78%, showcasing its math capabilities. In coding benchmarks such as Codeforces, the o1 models achieved high rankings, indicating strong coding performance.\n\nMultimodal Capabilities: The o1 models can handle text and image inputs, allowing for comprehensive analysis and interpretation of complex data. This multimodal functionality enhances their application across various domains.\n\nSelf-Fact-Checking: Self-fact-checking improves accuracy and reliability, particularly in technical domains like science and mathematics.\n\nChain-of-Thought Reasoning: The o1 models utilize large-scale reinforcement learning to engage in complex reasoning processes before generating responses. This approach helps them refine their outputs and recognize errors effectively.\n\nSafety Features: Enhanced bias mitigation and improved content policy adherence ensure that the responses generated by the o1 models are safe and appropriate. For instance, they achieve a not-unsafe score of 0.92 on the Challenging Refusal Evaluation.\n\nA Comparative Analysis: DeepSeek-R1 vs. OpenAI o1\n\nStrengths of DeepSeek-R1\n\nOpen-Source Accessibility: DeepSeek-R1’s open-source framework democratizes access to advanced AI capabilities, fostering innovation within the research community. Cost Efficiency: DeepSeek-R1’s development leveraged cost-effective techniques, enabling its deployment without the financial barriers often associated with proprietary models. Technical Excellence: GRPO and reasoning-oriented RL have equipped DeepSeek-R1 with cutting-edge reasoning abilities, particularly in mathematics and coding. Distillation for Smaller Models: By distilling its reasoning capabilities into smaller models, DeepSeek-R1 expands its usability. It offers high performance without excessive computational demands.\n\nStrengths of OpenAI o1\n\nComprehensive Safety Measures: OpenAI’s o1 models prioritize safety and compliance, making them reliable for high-stakes applications. General Capabilities: While DeepSeek-R1 focuses on reasoning tasks, OpenAI’s o1 models excel in various applications, including creative writing, knowledge retrieval, and conversational AI.\n\nThe Open-Source vs. Proprietary Debate\n\nThe emergence of DeepSeek-R1 has reignited the debate over the merits of open-source versus proprietary AI development. Proponents of open-source models argue that they accelerate innovation by pooling collective expertise and resources. Also, they promote transparency, which is vital for ethical AI deployment. On the other hand, proprietary models often claim superior performance due to their access to proprietary data and resources. The competition between these two paradigms represents a microcosm of the broader challenges in the AI landscape: balancing innovation, cost management, accessibility, and ethical considerations. After the release of DeepSeek-R1, Marc Andreessen tweeted on X, “Deepseek R1 is one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I’ve ever seen — and as open source, a profound gift to the world.”\n\nConclusion\n\nThe emergence of DeepSeek-R1 marks a transformative moment for the open-source AI industry. Its open-source nature, cost efficiency, and advanced reasoning capabilities challenge the dominance of proprietary systems and redefine the possibilities for AI innovation. In parallel, OpenAI’s o1 models set safety and general capability benchmarks. Together, these models reflect the dynamic and competitive nature of the AI landscape.\n\nSources\n\nAlso, don’t forget to follow us on Twitter and join our Telegram Channel and LinkedIn Group.

This means regulators believe its uncontrolled failure would lead to ripples throughout the financial system not unlike the collapse of Lehman Brothers 15 years ago.\n\nMarkets remain jittery despite the best efforts of regulators to restore calm. Shares fell Monday in Asia, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng index down 2.7% and Tokyo's benchmark Nikkei 225 losing 1.2%. Bank shares in the region were lower and futures in London and Frankfurt also fell.\n\nSunday's news conference follows the collapse of two large US banks last week that spurred a frantic, broad response from the US government to prevent any further bank panics. Still, global financial markets have been on edge since Credit Suisse's share price began plummeting this week.\n\nThe 167-year-old Credit Suisse already received a $50 billion (54 million Swiss francs) loan from the Swiss National Bank, which briefly caused a rally in the bank's stock price. Yet the move did not appear to be enough to stem an outflow of deposits, according to news reports.\n\nStill, many of Credit Suisse's problems are unique and do not overlap with the weaknesses that brought down Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, whose failures led to a significant rescue effort by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Reserve. As a result, their downfall does not necessarily signal the start of a financial crisis similar to what occurred in 2008.\n\nThe deal caps a highly volatile week for Credit Suisse, most notably on Wednesday when its shares plunged to a record low after its largest investor, the Saudi National Bank, said it wouldn't invest any more money into the bank to avoid tripping regulations that would kick in if its stake rose about 10%.\n\nFollowing news of the Swiss deal, the world’s central banks announced coordinated moves to stabilize banks, including access to a lending facility for banks to borrow U.S. dollars if they need them, a practice widely used during the 2008 crisis. Three months after Lehman Brothers collapsed in September of 2008, such swap lines had been tapped for $580 billion. Swap lines also were rolled out during market turmoil in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nColm Kelleher, the UBS chairman, hailed \"enormous opportunities\" from the takeover and highlighted his bank’s \"conservative risk culture\" – a subtle swipe at Credit Suisse's reputation for more swashbuckling gambles in search of bigger returns. He said the combined group would create a wealth manager with over $5 trillion in total invested assets.\n\nOn Friday, shares dropped 8% to close at 1.86 francs ($2) on the Swiss exchange. The stock has seen a long downward slide: It traded at more than 80 francs in 2007.\n\nIts current troubles began after Credit Suisse reported on Tuesday that managers had identified \"material weaknesses\" in the bank’s internal controls on financial reporting as of the end of last year. That fanned fears that Credit Suisse would be the next domino to fall.\n\nWhile smaller than its Swiss rival UBS, Credit Suisse still wields considerable influence, with $1.4 trillion assets under management. The firm has significant trading desks around the world, caters to the rich and wealthy through its wealth management business, and is a major advisor for global companies in mergers and acquisitions. Notably, Credit Suisse did not need government assistance in 2008 during the financial crisis, while UBS did.\n\nDespite the banking turmoil, the European Central Bank on Thursday approved a large, half-percentage point increase in interest rates to try to curb stubbornly high inflation, saying Europe’s banking sector is \"resilient,\" with strong finances.\n\nECB President Christine Lagarde said the banks \"are in a completely different position from 2008\" during the financial crisis, partly because of stricter government regulation.\n\nThe Swiss bank has been pushing to raise money from investors and roll out a new strategy to overcome an array of troubles, including bad bets on hedge funds, repeated shake-ups of its top management and a spying scandal involving UBS.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nRegulators expedited the merger process between Credit Suisse and UBS to avert a crisis.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

The former president, Donald Trump, recognized that the American people were tired of the ongoing war in Afghanistan, which was approaching its 20th year, and in February 2020, his administration negotiated with the Taliban to enable the U.S. to withdraw. In exchange for the release of 5000 Taliban fighters and the promise that the U.S. would withdraw within the next 14 months, the Taliban agreed not to attack U.S. soldiers.\n\nTrump’s dislike of the war in Afghanistan reflected the unpopularity of the long engagement, which by 2020 was ill defined. The war had begun in 2001, after terrorists affiliated with al-Qaeda attacked the United States on September 11 of that year. Taliban leaders in control of Afghanistan sheltered al-Qaeda, and after the attacks, the U.S. president, George W. Bush, demanded that Afghanistan hand over the terrorist leader believed to be behind the terrorist attack on the U.S: Osama bin Laden. In October, after Taliban leaders refused, the U.S. launched a bombing campaign.\n\nThat campaign was successful enough that in December 2001 the Taliban offered to surrender. But the U.S. rejected that surrender, determined by then to eradicate the extremist group and fill the vacuum of its collapse with a new, pro-American government. Al-Qaeda leader bin Laden escaped from Afghanistan to Pakistan, and the U.S. project in Afghanistan turned from an anti-terrorism mission into an effort to rebuild the Afghan government into a modern democracy.\n\nBy 2002 the Bush administration was articulating a new doctrine in foreign policy, arguing that the U.S. had a right to strike preemptively against countries that harbor terrorists. In 2003, under this doctrine, the U.S. launched a war on Iraq, which diverted money, troops, and attention from Afghanistan. The Taliban regrouped and began to regain the territory it had lost after the U.S. first began its bombing campaign in 2001.\n\nBy 2005, Bush administration officials privately worried the war in Afghanistan could not be won on its current terms, especially with the U.S. focused on Iraq. Then, when he took office in 2009, President Barack Obama turned his attention back to Afghanistan. He threw more troops into that country, bringing their numbers close to 100,000. In 2011, the U.S. military located bin Laden in Abbottabad, Pakistan, and launched a raid on the compound where he was hiding, killing him. By 2014, Obama had drawn troops in Afghanistan down to about 11,000, and in December of that year, he announced that the mission of the war—weakening the Taliban and capturing bin Laden—had been accomplished, and thus the war was over. The troops would come home.\n\nBut, of course, they didn’t, leaving Trump to develop his own policy. But his administration’s approach to the chaos in that country was different than his predecessor’s. By negotiating with the Taliban and excluding the Afghan government the U.S. had been supporting, the Trump team essentially accepted that the Taliban were the most important party in Afghanistan. The agreement itself reflected the oddity of the negotiations. Each clause referring to the Taliban began: “The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan which is not recognized by the United States as a state and is known as the Taliban will….”\n\nIt was immediately clear that the Taliban was not living up to its side of the bargain. Although it did stop attacking U.S. troops, It began to escalate violence in Afghanistan itself, assassinated political opponents, and maintained ties to al-Qaeda. Nonetheless, the Trump administration put pressure on the leaders of the Afghan government to release the 5000 Taliban prisoners, and they eventually did. Before Biden took office, Trump dropped the U.S. troop engagement in Afghanistan from about 13,000 to about 2500.\n\nWhen he took office, Biden had to decide whether to follow Trump’s path or to push back on the Taliban on the grounds they were not honoring the agreement Trump’s people had hammered out. Biden himself wanted to get out of the war. At the same time, he recognized that fighting the Taliban again would mean throwing more troops back into Afghanistan, and that the U.S. would again begin to take casualties. He opted to get the troops out, but extended the deadline to September 11, 2021, the twentieth anniversary of the initial attack. (Former president Trump complained that the troops should come out faster.)\n\nWhat Biden did not foresee was the speed with which the Taliban would retake control of the country. It swept over the regional capitals and then Kabul in about nine days in mid-August with barely a shot fired, and the head of the Afghan government fled the country, leaving it in chaos.\n\nThat speed left the U.S. flatfooted. Afghans who had been part of the government or who had helped the U.S. and its allies rushed to the airport to try to escape. In the pandemonium of that first day, up to seven people were killed; two people appear to have clung to a U.S. military plane as it took off, falling to their deaths.\n\nAnd yet, the Taliban, so far, has promised amnesty for its former opponents and limited rights for women. It has its own problems, as the Afghan government has been supported for the previous 20 years by foreign money, including a large percentage from the U.S. Not only has that money dried up as foreign countries refuse to back the Taliban, but also Biden has put sanctions on Afghanistan and also on some Pakistanis suspected of funding the Taliban. At the same time it appears that no other major sponsor, like Russia or China, has stepped in to fill the vacuum left by U.S. money, leaving the Taliban fishing for whatever goodwill it can find.\n\nYesterday, Josh Marshall of Talking Points Memo flagged tweets showing that members of the Afghan government, including the brother of the president who fled, are in what appear from the photos posted on Twitter to be relaxed talks about forming a new government. Other factions in Afghanistan would like to stop this from happening, and today Biden’s national security adviser Jake Sullivan warned that ISIS-K, another extremist group, is threatening to attack the airport to destabilize the Taliban.\n\nMeanwhile, there are 10,000 people crowded into that airport, and U.S. evacuations continue. The Kabul airport is secure—for now—and the U.S. military has created a larger perimeter around it for protection. The U.S. government has asked Americans in Afghanistan to shelter in place until they can be moved out safely; the Qatari ambassador to Afghanistan has been escorting groups of them to the airport. Evacuations have been slower than hoped because of backlogs at the next stage of the journey, but the government has enlisted the help of 18 commercial airlines to move those passengers forward, leaving room for new evacuees.\n\nYesterday, about 7800 evacuees left the Kabul airport. About 28,000 have been evacuated since August 14.\n\nInterestingly, much of the U.S. media is describing this scenario as a disaster for President Biden. Yet, on CNN this morning, Matthew Dowd, who was the chief strategist for the Bush-Cheney ticket in 2004, noted that more than 20,000 people have been evacuated from Afghanistan without a single loss of an American life, while in the same period of time, 5000 Americans have died from Covid-19 and 500 have died from gunshots.\n\n—-\n\nNotes:\n\nhttps://www.npr.org/2020/02/29/810537586/u-s-signs-peace-deal-with-taliban-after-nearly-2-decades-of-war-in-afghanistan\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2021/08/12/obama-afghan-war-ending-afghanistan-papers-book-excerpt/\n\nhttps://www.factcheck.org/2021/08/timeline-of-u-s-withdrawal-from-afghanistan/\n\nhttps://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/you-wouldnt-know-it-from-the-us-news-coverage-but\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/16/kabul-airport-chaos-and-panic-as-afghans-and-foreigners-attempt-to-flee-the-capital\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2021/08/22/afghanistan-biden-evacuations/\n\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2021/08/21/politics/kabul-airport-terror-warning/index.html\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/08/17/treasury-taliban-money-afghanistan/\n\nShare\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nOn August 15, 2021, the Taliban seized the presidential palace in Kabul and declared the war over.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

It says the president “gravely and extensively violated the constitution and the law” and accuses him of imposing martial law “with the unconstitutional and illegal intent to evade imminent investigations … into alleged illegal acts involving himself and his family”.\n\nIn an early Thursday morning session, lawmakers presented the impeachment motion to parliament.\n\n“This is an unforgivable crime – one that cannot, should not, and will not be pardoned,” MP Kim Seung-won said.\n\nYoon’s governing People Power Party said it would oppose the motion but the party has been divided over the crisis. The opposition Democratic Party, which has a majority in parliament, needs at least eight governing party lawmakers to back the bill in order for it to pass.\n\nUnder South Korea’s constitution, impeachment requires a two-thirds majority in the 300-member National Assembly. The Democratic Party currently holds 170 seats in parliament. A vote could take place as soon as Friday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe leader of the governing party on Wednesday slammed the incident and called for those involved to be held accountable.\n\n“The president must directly and thoroughly explain this tragic situation,” Han Dong-hoon told reporters in a televised broadcast.\n\nIf the National Assembly does agree to impeach, Yoon will be temporarily stripped of his presidential authority while the constitutional court considers his fate.\n\nSeveral senior officials have offered their resignations in the wake of the bungled events, including Presidential Chief of Staff Chung Jin-suk, National Security Adviser Shin Won-sik, and Presidential Chief of Staff for Policy Sung Tae-yoon.\n\nPrime Minister Han Duck-soo pledged to continue serving the people “until the last moment” and asked the cabinet to fulfil its responsibility together with the public officials of all ministries.\n\nThe Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, one of the country’s largest labour organisations, had called for a strike until the president’s resignation.\n\nOverreach\n\nYoon announced he would lift the martial law order hours after the initial declaration on Tuesday.\n\nHe had said he was forced to issue the order “to defend the free Republic of Korea from the threats of North Korean communist forces” and accused the political opposition of “paralysing” his government and “undermining” the constitutional order.\n\nLawmakers then tussled with soldiers in order to enter parliament where they passed a legally binding motion forcing Yoon to reverse the order.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Democratic Party leader, Park Chan-dae, warned soon after the martial law order ended that Yoon “cannot avoid the charge of treason”.\n\nGreg Scarlatoiu, the president and CEO of the Committee for Human Rights in North Korea, told Al Jazeera that Article 77 of the South Korean Constitution stipulates that martial law may be declared when the country basically faces an existential threat.\n\n“It seems that this is a fairly frivolous exercise in declaring martial law,” he said.\n\nScarlatoiu noted that there may be some basis to Yoon’s assertion of a threat to national security. The Democratic Party, which holds the majority in parliament, has made it impossible for the executive branch to operate.\n\nYet, the fact that 190 members of parliament rejected martial law was a sign the president had overreached.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nOpposition legislators filed an impeachment motion against President Yoon on Wednesday.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

The Global Times on Saturday talked to the company and several AI industrial observers to illustrate the phenomenon behind.\"China's cheap, open AI model DeepSeek thrills scientists,\" Nature wrote three days after a large language model called DeepSeek-R1 was released by the Chinese company on January 20. Its performance on certain tasks in chemistry, mathematics and coding is on par with that of OpenAI's o1, the Nature report said.\"How China's new AI model DeepSeek is threatening US dominance,\" a CNBC report on Friday emphasized concerns over DeepSeek's impact on US dominance in AI. It wrote that \"a little-known AI lab out of China has ignited panic throughout Silicon Valley after releasing AI models that can outperform America's best despite being built more cheaply and with less-powerful chips.\"A New York Times report wrote \"The company built a cheaper, competitive chatbot with fewer high-end computer chips than US behemoths like Google and OpenAI, showing the limits of chip export control,\" in a report titled \"How Chinese AI Start-Up DeepSeek Is Competing With Silicon Valley Giants.\"Attention on the Hangzhou-based startup began in December of last year following the launch of its large-scale AI model, \"DeepSeek-V3.\" This new model quickly gained traction among AI enthusiasts, sparking discussions that transcended borders and made their way to international social media platforms and tech forums.As of press time, there was no official response from the team, which media widely seen as \"a mysterious team\" that rarely spoke to media and overtly present themselves.When asked to comment on the external attention surrounding DeepSeek's development of a free, open-source large language model on Saturday, DeepSeek informed the Global Times that it could not provide additional information at this time. They recommended referring to the technical report for a better understanding of its model.According to a notice released by DeepSeek in an open communication group, the company stated that it \"does not engage in external project cooperation, nor does it provide privatization deployment and related support services.\" Additionally, DeepSeek emphasized that it will concentrate on research and development to develop more advanced models, encouraging everyone to \"please look forward to it.\"\"DeepSeek's technological approach challenges the US's dominance and monopoly in AI technology, proving that US' chip restrictions have been ineffective,\" Li Baiyang, an associate professor of intelligence studies with Nanjing University, told the Global Times on Saturday, in explanation why DeepSeek has ignited wide attention from not only China but the Silicon Valley in the US.The US is currently seeking to uphold its dominance in the field of artificial intelligence through various policies and administrative regulations, with a focus on safeguarding its edge in computational and algorithmic capabilities, the expert said.Tian Feng, former dean of the Intelligence Industry Research Institute at Chinese AI software giant SenseTime, described DeepSeek's ability to achieve impressive generative results with lower training costs, along with its complete open-source approach to technology and foundational models as a move likely to \"redefine the development rules for AI.\"It demonstrates comparable advantages to OpenAI's o1 model, along with a training cost of only about $6 million for its V3 model— about one-tenth of what Meta invests in comparable AI models, Tian told the Global Times on Saturday.NVIDIA Senior Research Manager Jim Fan said on X that \"We are living in a timeline where a non-US company is keeping the original mission of OpenAI alive - truly open, frontier research that empowers all. \"According to an anonymous post on Teamblind, a forum for verified Big Tech employees, Meta's AI department is feeling the pressure, according to a report by media outlet The Decoder. The post wrote that Meta is \"in panic mode. Engineers are moving frantically to dissect DeepSeek and copy anything and everything we can from it.\"Meta's Mark Zuckerberg took to Facebook recently to outline his company's response, saying that in 2025, Meta aims to develop an AI assistant that can serve more than a billion people. \"This will be a defining year for AI,\" Zuckerberg wrote, according to the The Decoder report.The approach taken by the Chinese tech start-up has put unprecedented pressure on US AI companies, as it is likely to attract more users and developers globally to participate in high-end AI development, which may weaken the market share and influence of American AI companies, according to Tian.The US stringent measures guard against China in the field of AI, covering various aspects such as chips, talent, computing power, algorithms, and data, and it can be said that \"no means are being spared in their sanctions,\" Li Baiyang said.However, how China's AI innovates testifies its minimal impact, instead, such restrictions have caused many American companies to miss opportunities for collaborative development with China's industrial innovation, Li Baiyang said.The New York Times, as mentioned above, left the question of China-US competition in AI open-ended. It wrote that \"If the best open source technologies come from China, they argue, US developers will build their systems atop those technologies. In the long-run, China could emerge as a central player in AI innovation globally.\"Li Baiyang said DeepSeek's open-source technological route applications embody China's inclusive and accessible mindset, which is of great significance for strengthening the ecosystem of China's AI industry.\"China can achieve significant breakthroughs by pursuing our own path, as long as we continue to innovate,\" Tian said.US President Donald Trump recently announced a $500 billion AI infrastructure investment in the US. Three top tech firms will create a new company, called Stargate, to grow artificial intelligence infrastructure in the US, according to CNN.The healthy competition between China and the US in AI depends on the US attitude. As the two leading powers in the global AI field, China and the US compete in the AI industry, but there is also significant room for cooperation, especially in AI governance, Li Baiyang added.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nDeepSeek released its large language model, DeepSeek-R1, on January 20.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Walker’s relationship with the president-elect goes back to at least the 1980s, when he played for the New Jersey Generals, a short-lived United States Football League team bought by Trump.

In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump wrote that her appointment would ensure that “the American values of Freedom and Liberty are broadcast around the World FAIRLY and ACCURATELY, unlike the lies spread by the Fake News Media.” The former news anchor and 2022 Arizona gubernatorial candidate has embraced Trump’s false claims about the 2020 elections being stolen. After losing to Democrat Katie Hobbs in the Governor’s race in 2022, she refused to concede and made multiple failed legal attempts to challenge the results. Responding to the announcement, Lake thanked Trump on X and said VOA is a “vital international media outlet dedicated to advancing the interests of the United States.” Under her leadership, Lake said, VOA will “excel” at “chronicling America’s achievements worldwide.”\n\n## Undersecretary Of State For Economic Growth, Energy And The Environment: Jacob Helberg\n\n**Jacob Helberg **was appointed to serve as the State Department’s top economic policy and trade advisor.

Sheriff **Chad Chronister** was Trump’s initial choice to lead the Drug Enforcement Agency, but Chronister posted to X that he decided to withdraw. The post was met with accounts celebrating the withdrawal and ridiculing past decisions. But, the following day Trump took credit for Chronister stepping down, saying on Truth Social Chronister “didn’t pull out, I pulled him out.” Trump said he did so “because I did not like what he said to my pastors and other supporters.” As sheriff, Chronister once arrested a pastor for breaking Covid-19 lockdown rules in 2020.

The letter, which was criticized by health experts including Dr. Anthony Fauci, argued for “herd immunity” for most of the population “through natural infection” while sheltering vulnerable populations. According to his profile page on Stanford Medicine, the India-born Bhattacharya serves as professor of health policy at the university.\n\n## United States Trade Representative: Jamieson Greer\n\nWashington lawyer **Jamieson Greer** is Trump’s pick to lead international trade negotiations.

Trump said Hassett “will play an important role in helping American families recover from the Inflation that was unleashed by the Biden Administration.” Hassett, who led the Council of Economic Advisers during Trump’s first term, recently expressed some skepticism about some of Trump’s economic proposals, telling Goldman Sachs last month Trump’s proposal to reduce the corporate tax rate to 15% was unlikely to net the same “dynamic effects” as the 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act, and Trump’s tariffs proposals would likely require legislation, Politico reported. Hassett also told Goldman that Federal Reserve leadership should be “neutral” from the administration and said “suspicions” about Trump’s desire for coordination between the Fed and the White House in setting interest rates “should be taken seriously.”\n\n## Domestic Policy Council Director: Vince Haley\n\n**Vince Haley, **who served as adviser and speechwriter during Trump’s first term was named as the head of the Domestic Policy Council.

Kennedy Jr. and “oversee all operations and improve Management, Transparency, and Accountability to, Make America Healthy Again.” O’Neill previously served as the CEO of the Thiel Foundation and was up for consideration for the FDA commissioner role during Trump’s first term. O’Neill also worked as the HHS principal associate deputy secretary during the George W. Bush administration.

Bessent—who spoke recently with Forbes—had long been seen as a top choice for the role, especially as it was reported Trump was leaning toward someone with Wall Street experience. Bessent is the founder of Key Square Management, a hedge fund that had less than $600 million in assets under management at the end of last year, and worked for Democratic megadonor George Soros for years before that. Bessent donated about $3 million to Trump and other Republican causes this election season and previously said Trump was “very sophisticated on economic policy.” Bessent is known for being pro-tariff—tariffs are at the center of Trump’s economic policies—and called the import taxes a “negotiating tool with our trading partners” in a Fox News column.

Matt Gaetz’s withdrawal. Bondi served as Florida’s top lawyer from 2011 to 2019, and later joined Trump’s defense team in his first Senate impeachment trial in 2020. She also served on a Trump-era commission on opioids and drug addiction. Attorney general is one of the most high-profile and highly anticipated appointments, as Trump has fiercely criticized the Justice Department for prosecuting him and is expected to drastically change its makeup—and possibly push for retribution against his opponents. In a Truth Social post, Trump said Bondi will “refocus the DOJ to its intended purpose of fighting Crime, and Making America Safe Again.”\n\n## Secretary Of Defense: Pete Hegseth\n\nTrump selected **Pete Hegseth** as his secretary of defense, praising his status as a combat veteran and role as a co-host on Fox & Friends Weekend. Revelations subsequently emerged that Hegseth was accused of sexually assaulting a woman at a Monterey, California, hotel in 2017. The Monterey Police Department confirmed in a statement that it investigated the incident, but did not bring charges. Hegseth has denied the allegations through his attorney, Timothy Parlatore, who told multiple outlets he paid his accuser a settlement to avoid a lawsuit over the matter.\n\n## Health And Human Services Secretary: Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\nTrump nominated **Robert F. Kennedy Jr.** to lead the Health and Human Services Department, making good on his promise to give Kennedy broad leeway over public health. Kennedy, who ran for the Democratic nomination then as an independent candidate before dropping out and endorsing Trump, espouses debunked views on public health—including skepticism about the efficacy of childhood vaccines and the Covid-19 vaccine. He has also advocated for removing fluoride from public water, an idea Trump said he as open to. As HHS secretary, Kennedy would oversee 13 public health-related agencies, and has expressed plans to upend many of them, telling an audience at a conference in November he would halt infectious disease studies at the National Institutes of Health if given a role in the Trump administration. “I’m going to say to NIH scientists, God bless you all . . . thank you for your public service,” NBC reported. The surprise selection drew criticism from many Democrats, and some Republicans expressed wariness about the pick. Trump’s former Vice President Mike Pence spoke against Kennedy as the pick to lead HHS in a statement and urged Senate Republicans to reject the nomination, citing Kennedy’s support of abortion rights.\n\n## Secretary Of State: Marco Rubio\n\nTrump nominated Sen. **Marco Rubio**, R-Fla., as secretary of state. Rubio and Trump feuded when they both ran for president in 2016, but the two smoothed over their relationship during Trump’s most recent White House run. Rubio frequently campaigned for Trump and was said to be in the running to be his vice presidential pick. Some of Rubio’s foreign policy stances break with Trump, including his co-sponsorship of legislation last year that would prohibit a president from exiting NATO without congressional approval. Rubio would be the first Latino to hold the position, which is subject to Senate confirmation. Forbes estimated Rubio’s net worth at over $1 million—significantly less than some other members of Trump’s inner circle, but a jump since 2015, when he was worth just $100,000.\n\n## Director Of National Intelligence: Tulsi Gabbard\n\nTrump announced **Tulsi Gabbard** will serve as his Director of National Intelligence, a role that puts her at the head of the U.S. intelligence community. Gabbard is a former Democratic representative from Hawaii and a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, perhaps best-known for clashing with Kamala Harris on the debate stage in 2019. She left the party in 2022 and became an independent, before endorsing Trump in August and announcing she had joined the Republican Party. A critic of U.S. military interventions, Gabbard has drawn intense scrutiny for her foreign policy views, including for meeting with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in 2017.\n\n## Education Secretary: Linda Mcmahon\n\nTrump tapped former WWE CEO **Linda McMahon** as secretary of the Department of Education. McMahon is Trump’s transition co-chair alongside Lutnick and served as the administrator of the Small Business Administration from 2017 to 2019. The nomination came after Lutnick was picked as commerce secretary over McMahon, who was “privately frustrated” she was not offered the position before Lutnick was tapped for it, Semafor reported, citing two unnamed people familiar with the matter. McMahon is also the America First Policy Institute’s board chair, helping lead the think tank that has raised millions in support of Trump, according to CNN.\n\n## Commerce Secretary: Howard Lutnick\n\n**Howard Lutnick** is Trump’s pick for commerce secretary—choosing him for the commerce role instead of treasury secretary. Trump, in a statement, called Lutnick “the embodiment of resilience in the face of unspeakable tragedy,” referencing his charitable contributions to 9/11 families after 658 Cantor Fitzgerald employees, including Lutnick’s brother, died in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, while Lutnick was CEO. Lutnick, who rebuilt the company after 9/11, has spent his entire career at Cantor Fitzgerald and became president and CEO of the financial services firm at the age of 29. His special purposes acquisition company, Cantor Fitzgerald Acquisition Corp., took the Rumble video platform popular among right-wing influencers public in 2022. As commerce secretary, Lutnick will play a role in implementing Trump’s plans for steeper tariffs and he has expressed broad support for the proposal. Lutnick was previously under consideration for treasury secretary—typically a more prominent Cabinet job—and earned support from Musk and Kennedy, but Trump ultimately turned his attention to other candidates after he reportedly became annoyed with Lutnick’s aggressive campaign for the treasury role.\n\n## Homeland Security Secretary: Kristi Noem\n\nTrump picked South Dakota Gov. **Kristi Noem** for the role of secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. Noem is a long-time Trump loyalist who was believed be a contender for Vice President. The appointee will be essential in carrying out Trump’s aggressive immigration plans, in addition to the agency’s duties surrounding cybersecurity, antiterrorism and emergency response.\n\n## Agriculture Secretary: Brooke Rollins\n\nTrump announced **Brooke Rollins **as his pick for agriculture secretary. Rollins served as a policy advisor during Trump’s first administration and is the president of the America First Policy Institute, a think tank founded by former Trump administration officials that has advocated against foreign ownership of U.S. farmland. She was reportedly considered for White House chief of staff before Susie Wiles was named to the role.\n\n## Centers For Medicare And Medicaid Services Administrator: Mehmet Oz\n\n**Mehmet Oz**, the celebrity doctor who lost his 2022 Senate bid to Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., will fill the role. Oz will work closely with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who Trump announced as his pick for Health and Human Services secretary. Oz’s rise to fame is largely tied to his frequent appearances on the Oprah Winfrey show in the early 2000s and his own subsequent daytime talk show. He’s accused of espousing questionable medical claims, including promoting the debunked theory that the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine could treat Covid-19, and pushing so-called miracle weight loss products unsupported by scientific research. Trump endorsed Oz in his 2022 Senate campaign.\n\n## Chief Of Staff: Susie Wiles\n\nTrump named his campaign co-manager **Susie Wiles** chief of staff two days after his election win, marking his first major administrative pick. Wiles will be the first woman to hold the position.\n\n## Department Of Government Efficiency: Elon Musk And Vivek Ramaswamy\n\nTrump announced **Elon Musk**, the world’s wealthiest person, will run a new Department of Government Efficiency (or “DOGE”) alongside investor and former Republican primary candidate **Vivek Ramaswamy**. Trump said in a statement the department—which has not yet been created—will offer “advice and guidance from outside of Government” and focus on “making changes to the Federal Bureaucracy with an eye on efficiency,” including through spending and regulatory cuts. Musk, a vocal Trump backer who donated over $100 million to a pro-Trump super PAC, has pitched the department in the past, seemingly naming it after the meme cryptocurrency dogecoin.\n\n## Office Of Management And Budget Director: Russell Vought\n\nTrump nominated **Russell Vought** as director of the Office of Budget and Management, potentially marking his second time in the role. Vought was the office’s director from 2020 to 2021 after serving as deputy director and acting director. Vought authored a chapter in the controversial Project 2025 policy agenda on the Executive Office of the President of the United States and will be in charge of overseeing the White House budget and implementation of Trump’s policies throughout the executive branch. He also reportedly said in secret camera footage published by the Centre for Climate Reporting that Trump “blessed” Project 2025 despite distancing himself from it on the campaign trail. Vought is expected to push for policy restructuring that provides more power to the president.\n\n## Homeland Security Adviser And Deputy Chief Of Staff For Policy: Stephen Miller\n\nTrump announced **Stephen Miller **as White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy, plus the additional role of homeland security adviser. Miller was a senior adviser to Trump during his first administration and one of the architects of some of his most controversial immigration policies, including his family separation program.\n\n## Border Czar: Tom Homan\n\nTrump appointed his former Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director **Tom Homan** to newly created role, he announced, as Trump plans a mass deportation of undocumented migrants during his second term.\n\n## Cdc Director: Dave Weldon, Fda Commissioner: Marty Makary, Surgeon General: Janette Nesheiwat\n\nTrump announced former Rep. **Dave Weldon**, R-Fla.—who served in Congress from 1995 to 2009—as CDC director, and tapped **Marty Makary**, who became known for opposing vaccine mandates during the COVID-19 pandemic, as FDA commissioner. He also named former Fox News contributor **Janette Nesheiwat** as his pick for surgeon general.\n\n## Secretary Of Labor: Lori Chavez-Deremer\n\nRep. **Lori Chavez-DeRemer**, R-Ore., was nominated as Trump’s secretary of labor. She was elected to the House of Representatives in 2022 to represent Oregon’s 5th Congressional District and recently lost her reelection bid.\n\n## Senior Director For Counterterrorism: Sebastian Gorka\n\n**Sebastian Gorka** was appointed as the deputy assistant to the president and senior director for counterterrorism. He previously served as strategist to the president in the first Trump administration and is the host of his own radio show, “America First with Sebastian Gorka.”\n\n## Hud Secretary: Scott Turner\n\nTrump named former NFL player **Scott Turner** as his pick for secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Turner served in the first Trump administration as the executive director of Trump’s White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council.\n\n## National Security Adviser: Mike Waltz\n\nTrump appointed Rep. **Mike Waltz**, R-Fla., to serve as his national security adviser. In recent months, Waltz—a former Army Green Beret—has frequently criticized China, urged NATO members to pay more for defense and said he expects Trump to push Ukraine and Russia toward a negotiated end to the war in Ukraine.\n\n## Interior Secretary: Doug Burgum (and Head Of New National Energy Council)\n\nTrump nominated North Dakota Gov. **Doug Burgum** as secretary of the interior. If confirmed by the Senate, he’ll be responsible for managing vast swaths of federally owned land, administering national parks and handling oil and gas drilling on federal property—which Trump has vowed to ramp up. Trump also tapped Burgum as chairman of the new National Energy Council, which will cut down on regulations and “oversee the path to U.S. ENERGY DOMINANCE,” according to Trump. The position will also provide Burgum a seat on the National Security Council. First elected North Dakota governor in 2016, Burgum briefly ran against Trump in the 2024 GOP primaries, but dropped out and endorsed Trump. A tech executive and investor by trade, Burgum previously ran Great Plains Software, remaining at the company after it was acquired by Microsoft. Last year, Forbes estimated his net worth at at least $100 million.\n\n## Energy Secretary: Chris Wright\n\n**Chris Wright**, chief executive of the oilfield services group Liberty Energy, was named Trump’s nominee for secretary of energy. Wright has argued against climate change’s role in causing extreme weather events, saying in a video posted to LinkedIn last year “there is no climate crisis, and we’re not in the midst of an energy transition either.” He later disputed he was “[fighting] climate science,” despite saying the claims he made were “correct.”\n\n## Transportation Secretary: Sean Duffy\n\nTrump nominated former Rep. **Sean Duffy**, R-Wisc., as secretary of transportation, lauding his time in Congress and his role as a member of the House Financial Services Committee. Following his resignation from Congress in 2019, Duffy registered as a lobbyist and continued spending campaign funds on Trump’s D.C. hotel. The campaign spent more than $22,000 at Trump’s D.C. hotel between 2017 and 2020, $17,000 of which was spent in a single day in July 2019. Duffy is a co-host of Fox Business’ “The Bottom Line” and has contributed to Fox News since 2020. He is married to “Fox & Friends Weekend” co-host Rachel Campos-Duffy.\n\n## Veterans Affairs Secretary: Doug Collins\n\nTrump picked former Rep. **Doug Collins**, R-Ga., as his secretary for veterans affairs. Collins served as a congressman from 2013 to 2021, and was known as a vocal backer of Trump in the chamber during his first administration. He is also a chaplain in the United States Air Force Reserve Command. Collins vowed to “streamline and cut regulations in the VA, root out corruption, and ensure every veteran receives the benefits they've earned.” The former congressman was deployed to Iraq in 2008 as a member of the Air Force’s 94th Airlift Wing.\n\n## Cia Director: John Ratlciffe\n\nFormer Director of National Intelligence **John Ratcliffe** will serve as CIA director. A former Texas congressman, Ratcliffe served as the director of national intelligence from 2020 to 2021 and acted as Trump’s primary intelligence adviser during his last presidency. During his time as director of national intelligence, Ratcliffe declassified unverified Russian intelligence information that claimed Hillary Clinton approved a plan to link Trump to Russia and the Democratic National Committee cyberattacks in 2016. Democrats criticized Ratcliffe’s decision to publicly release the information, alleging he was politicizing unverified information to aid Trump.\n\n## Environmental Protection Agency Administrator: Lee Zeldin\n\nTrump tapped former Rep. **Lee Zeldin**, R-N.Y., to lead the EPA, citing his “very strong legal background” and calling him “a true fighter for America First policies” in a statement. Zeldin—a Trump ally who ran for New York governor two years ago—“will ensure fair and swift deregulatory decisions that will be enacted in a way to unleash the power of American business while at the same time maintaining the highest environmental standards,” the statement said.\n\n## Fcc Chair: Brendan Carr\n\nTrump named **Brendan Carr** to chair the Federal Communications Commission. Carr has served as one of the FCC’s five commissioners since 2017, when Trump first appointed him to the agency. He’s known as a critic of big tech companies, writing a chapter of the controversial Project 2025 agenda—which Trump has broadly disavowed—that argued the FCC should narrow the immunity enjoyed by tech platforms and require companies to be transparent about their content moderation decisions. He’s also used his platform at the FCC to back Musk. He’ll take over the FCC as Trump pushes the agency to revoke the licenses of broadcast TV stations whose coverage he claims is unfair—though that could be very difficult in practice.\n\n## Ambassador To Un: Elise Stefanik\n\nTrump nominated GOP Conference Chair Rep. **Elise Stefanik**, R-N.Y., for the United Nations ambassador role. Stefanik is known as a staunch Trump ally.\n\n## Special Envoy To The Middle East: Steven C. Witkoff\n\nTrump tapped** Steven Witkoff**, a GOP donor and real estate investor, for special envoy to the Middle East. Witkoff is chairman of the University of Miami Business School Real Estate Advisory Board and the CEO of Witkoff, a real estate firm he founded in 1997. He is also a longtime friend of Trump’s and one of the president-elect’s golf partners. Witkoff was with Trump during the apparent second assassination attempt on his life, telling NBC that Secret Service agents dived on Trump and got him off his Florida golf course in under 20 seconds.\n\n## Ambassador To Nato: Matthew Whitaker\n\nTrump announced **Matthew Whitaker** will serve as the official U.S. representative to NATO. Whitaker was the former U.S. acting attorney general appointed after former Attorney General Jeff Sessions resigned and before former Attorney General William Barr was sworn in during Trump’s first term. Whitaker oversaw the DOJ during former Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and was heavily scrutinized by Democrats over whether he sought to interfere in the probe on Trump’s behalf, allegations he denied. Whitaker frequently appears on Fox News as an advocate for Trump, defending his decision to tap Gaetz as attorney general and broadly criticizing the Justice Department over its various investigations into Trump’s conduct.\n\n## Ambassador To Israel: Mike Huckabee\n\nTrump announced former Arkansas Gov. **Mike Huckabee** as his envoy to Israel, touting his military service as he served in the Army Special Forces for 27 years. Huckabee is a staunch supporter of Israel and has criticized the Biden administration’s calls for a cease-fire with Hamas. Huckabee has advocated for Israel to annex parts of the West Bank, which Israel occupied in 1967, and has backed Israeli settlers in the territory. A former Southern Baptist pastor, Huckabee regularly leads evangelicals on visits to Israel.\n\n## White House Press Secretary: Karoline Leavitt\n\n**Karoline Leavitt**, the Trump campaign’s national press secretary, will serve as White House Press Secretary once the president-elect assumes his office. Leavitt, 27, was an assistant press secretary during Trump’s first presidency. She also won the Republican primary in New Hampshire's 1st Congressional District in 2022, becoming the second Gen Z candidate to win a House primary.\n\n## White House Communications Director: Steven Cheung\n\nTrump picked his campaign spokesman, **Steven Cheung**, to serve as his communications director at the White House. Cheung was the director of communications for the president-elect’s 2024 presidential campaign and served as director of strategic response during Trump’s last term, after working in communications for the Ultimate Fighting Championship previously.\n\n## Other White House Jobs\n\n- Trump named\n**James Braid**his director of legislative affairs—Braid is Vice President-elect Sen. JD Vance’s lead policy staffer and worked in the Office of Management and Budget during Trump’s first term. **Matt Brasseaux**, a deputy political director for the Trump campaign and Republican National Committee in 2024, was appointed director of the office of political affairs.**Alex Latcham**, Trump’s former deputy political director during his first administration and a senior deputy political director for his most recent campaign and the RNC, will serve as director of the office of public liaison.- Campaign staffer and former One America News anchor\n**Natalie Harp**—nicknamed the “human printer” as she’s known for trailing Trump with a portable printer and supplying him with paper copies of news stories—is expected to help control the flow of information to and from Trump, according to The New York Times, though she hasn’t officially been given a role. - Top GOP lawyer\n**William McGinley**was chosen for White House counsel, after previously working as Trump’s White House cabinet secretary from 2017 to 2019, advising other cabinet members on policy coordination, optics and ethics. **Dan Scavino**will return to his role as deputy chief of staff, after serving as a longtime Trump communications staffer (he was held in contempt of Congress for refusing to testify in the House Jan. 6 committee investigation, but the Justice Department declined to prosecute him).**James Blair**will work as deputy chief of staff for legislative, political and public affairs, after spearheading Trump’s grassroots voter outreach efforts and making frequent media appearances.**Taylor Budowich**was picked for deputy chief of staff for communications and personnel, after running the Trump-aligned MAGA Inc. super PAC.- Trump tapped\n**William Scharf**to be White House staff secretary: Scharf, a former prosecutor who ran in the Republican primary for Missouri attorney general, was part of Trump’s legal team that successfully argued he has immunity from official acts he took during his first term. **Sergio Gor**, president and co-founder of Donald Trump Jr.’s Winning Team Publishing company, has been tapped to lead the Presidential Personnel Office.\n\n## Other Justice Department Jobs\n\n**Joseph Nocella Jr.**, a Nassau County District Court Judge, was tapped as U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, one of the most high-profile districts in the country spanning Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island and parts of Long Island. Nocella will replace Biden appointee Breon Peace, who is stepping down later this month.**Todd Blanche**, Trump’s hush money trial lawyer, was tapped as the president-elect’s deputy attorney general. Blanche was lauded as “an excellent attorney who will be a crucial leader in the Justice Department,” which Trump has often criticized throughout his criminal and civil cases.- Trump picked another of his attorneys,\n**Emil Bove**, as principal associate deputy attorney general. Bove represented Trump alongside Blanche throughout the hush money trial and is a former federal prosecutor. **Dean John Sauer**was chosen for for solicitor general, after he was credited with helping win Trump’s presidential immunity case, which resulted in the Supreme Court ruling that presidents have some immunity for official acts they take in office. Sauer also served as solicitor general of Missouri for six years and clerked for late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.- Former Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman\n**Jay Clayton**was chosen as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, widely seen as one of the most prestigious prosecuting jobs due to the high-profile cases filed in the district, which includes New York City.\n\n## Tangent\n\nTrump asked Republican National Committee co-chair Michael Whatley to return to his role. Trump tapped Whatley and his daughter-in-law Lara Trump to co-chair the RNC after he effectively secured the GOP 2024 presidential nomination.\n\n## Key Background\n\nTrump decamped to Mar-a-Lago after his win, holding meetings with his inner circle, administration hopefuls and transition team to craft his second term agenda and build out his staff. Trump is shaping his second-term agenda with the help of several right-wing groups, his closest allies and billionaire backers. Musk, who has been spotted on numerous occasions alongside Trump since his election, is among those who appear to be influencing Trump’s policy and personnel decisions. Lutnick is also overseeing a team making recommendations for personnel picks and vetting potential candidates, and Miller is expected to play a key role in making the final decisions. The right-wing think tank America First Policy Institute is reportedly the primary driver of Trump’s transition plans and has been crafting possible executive actions for Trump once he takes office. The organization is chaired by McMahon and led by former Trump Domestic Policy Counsel Director Brook Rollins.\n\n## Further Reading\n\nWho Will Help Shape Trump’s Policy Agenda?

He needs to think about the poor as well,” said Andre, a 38-year-old with no driver’s licence who nonetheless joined a blockade in Dole, eastern France.\n\nOpposition parties and labour unions have voiced support for the demonstration but most have not joined, wary of being seen alongside officials from the National Rally and other far-right groups.\n\nThe government announced last week a series of measures to quell the anger, including energy subsidies and higher scrappage bonuses towards cleaner vehicles.\n\nAnd in a TV interview this week Macron admitted that he had “not succeeded in reconciling the French with their leaders” and “we have probably not given them enough consideration.”\n\nBut he said he would not rescind the fuel tax increases, which are set to rise again in January.— AFP\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nPrime Minister Edouard Philippe announced nearly 500 million euros in aid for low-income motorists.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

But speaking at the company's Connect virtual reality conference, Zuckerberg said it's time to overhaul the corporation's identity to reflect its broader ambitions.\n\n\"It is time for us to adopt a new company brand to encompass everything that we do,\" he said. \"From now on, we're going to be metaverse first, not Facebook first.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nSeventeen years after Zuckerberg founded Facebook in his Harvard University dorm room, the company's brand has been badly dented by a succession of crises, from Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election to the Cambridge Analytica data privacy scandal, which became public in 2018, to last month's damaging revelations from former Facebook employee turned whistleblower Frances Haugen.\n\nBut even as the company has been pummeled by a wave of critical news coverage about its platforms' harms, based on Haugen's trove of internal documents, Zuckerberg has unapologetically kept his focus on the metaverse, describing it on Thursday as the company's new \"North Star.\"\n\nHe says the metaverse is the next big computing platform to which people's attention — and dollars — will shift in the coming years. And he wants the newly christened Meta to play a prime role in creating it and turning it into big business.\n\n\"Building our social media apps will always be an important focus for us. But right now, our brand is so tightly linked to one product that it can't possibly represent everything that we're doing today, let alone in the future,\" Zuckerberg said.\n\nSo just what is the metaverse anyway?\n\nZuckerberg announced the new name, Meta, in a glitzy video presentation that served as an explainer about the metaverse, a futuristic and vaguely defined concept that has become a Silicon Valley buzzword in recent years.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe term \"metaverse\" was coined by science fiction writer Neal Stephenson in his 1992 novel, Snow Crash. Enthusiasts use it to refer to immersive virtual spaces where people can play games, attend concerts, meet with colleagues and buy all kinds of digital goods and services.\n\nFacebook demonstrated many of those experiences in Thursday's slickly produced video, showing Zuckerberg riding a virtual reality electric hydrofoil (in a nod to his real-life hobby), fencing with a hologram and walking through a 3D rendering of his \"home space.\"\n\nThis week, Facebook told investors its spending on virtual reality and other next-generation products and services will take a $10 billion bite out of its overall operating profit this year. It also announced plans to hire 10,000 workers in Europe over the next five years to build the metaverse.\n\nOn Thursday, Zuckerberg said he expects to invest \"many billions of dollars for years to come,\" painting a vision of the future where a billion people will use the metaverse and it will generate hundreds of billions of dollars in digital commerce — while acknowledging it remains \"a long way off.\"\n\n\"We are fully committed to this,\" Zuckerberg said. \"It is the next chapter of our work and, we believe, for the internet overall.\"\n\nIn a nod to Facebook's long run of crises, Zuckerberg devoted part of the presentation to emphasizing that the company will center privacy and safety as it builds its new virtual services and hardware.\n\n\"Privacy standards will be built into the metaverse from Day 1,\" he said. \"One of the lessons I've internalized from the last five years is we need to emphasize these principles from the start.\"\n\nThe change could be key to the company's existence\n\nStaying on top of the next big thing in tech is about more than just Zuckerberg's interest in Silicon Valley's latest fad. It's about his company's continued existence, which depends on attracting younger users.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe leaked internal documents show Facebook is worried about losing relevance as its user base grows older. People under 30 are spending less time on Facebook, posting less and sending fewer messages, according to an internal report prepared in March and reported on by Bloomberg.\n\nMeanwhile, Instagram, which the company views as a pipeline for younger users who will eventually age into its other apps, is losing teenagers to other social media platforms — a phenomenon the company identified as an \"existential threat,\" The New York Times reported.\n\nZuckerberg told investors on Monday that he's reorienting the company around appealing to young adults ages 18 to 29, rather than the older crowd that has become its core. He cited threats, including short-video app TikTok, which he said is \"one of the most effective competitors that we have ever faced.\"\n\nThe company's big corporate overhaul comes as Congress threatens to pass tougher regulations on the tech industry, with some lawmakers saying it has grown so big and powerful that it is like Big Tobacco in its heyday.\n\n\"Facebook is going through so much turmoil, so much negativity\" that the name change risks looking like \"you are trying to hide something,\" said Prashant Malaviya, a marketing professor at Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business.\n\nIndeed, critics were quick on Thursday to accuse the company of just that.\n\n\"The name change from Facebook to Meta may make sense from a commercial marketing perspective, but it's also a blatant attempt to distance Mark Zuckerberg's company from growing outrage over the harm it is causing to democracy in the U.S. and around the world,\" said Paul Barrett, deputy director of the NYU Stern Center for Business and Human Rights, in a statement. \"Zuckerberg and his lieutenants can't shed the Facebook albatross with a clever brand adjustment.\"\n\nChanging names often yields mixed results\n\nOther companies have changed their names in times of crisis, with mixed results. In 2001, when Marlboro cigarette-maker Philip Morris announced plans to rename itself Altria, a former Food and Drug Administration commissioner accused the company of \"running away from tobacco.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nMalaviya says the Altria rebranding worked at the corporate level — but he points out the company never attempted to change the name of Marlboro, the product people actually knew.\n\nSimilarly, the Facebook social network, known internally as the \"big blue app,\" isn't going anywhere.\n\n\"The Facebook brand is going to continue to exist. The app will be there. Instagram is still going to be there,\" Malaviya said. \"And that's where we have the problems with what the company is doing.\"\n\nIn 2015, Google reorganized under a new parent company called Alphabet, and its founders handed over the day-to-day running of its lucrative search engine — although the company is still widely referred to as Google.\n\nIf that history is any guide, Malaviya said, don't expect the name \"Facebook\" to disappear from conversation or headlines.\n\n\"Even if they're talking about this new company, the people on Wall Street and Main Street might still continue to say, 'Well, yeah, that's still just Facebook.' \"\n\nEditor's note: Facebook and Google are among NPR's recent financial supporters.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nFacebook replaced its corporate sign outside its California headquarters with one featuring the Meta logo.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Our 20 years of sacrifice worked.\"\n\nIn Washington, Gen. Frank McKenzie, head of U.S. Central Command, announced the completion of America's longest war and the evacuation effort, saying the last planes took off from Kabul airport at 3:29 p.m. EDT — one minute before midnight Monday in Kabul.\n\n\"We did not get everybody out that we wanted to get out,\" he said.\n\nWith its last troops gone, the U.S. ended its 20-year war with the Taliban back in power. Many Afghans remain fearful of their rule or of further instability, and there have been sporadic reports of killings and other abuses in areas under Taliban control despite the group's pledges to restore peace and security.\n\n\"American soldiers left the Kabul airport, and our nation got its full independence,\" Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said early Tuesday.\n\nThe U.S. and its allies invaded Afghanistan shortly after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attack on the United States, which al-Qaida orchestrated while sheltering under Taliban rule. The invasion drove the Taliban from power in a matter of weeks and scattered Osama bin Laden and other top al-Qaida leaders.\n\nThe U.S. and its allies launched an ambitious effort to rebuild Afghanistan after decades of war, investing billions of dollars in a Western-style government and security forces. Women, who had been largely confined to their homes under the Taliban's hard-line rule, benefited from access to education and came to assume prominent roles in public life.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBut the Taliban never went away.\n\nIn the coming years, as the U.S. focused on another troubled war in Iraq and the Afghan government became mired in corruption, the Taliban regrouped in the countryside and in neighboring Pakistan. In recent years, they seized large parts of rural Afghanistan and carried out near-daily assaults on Afghan security forces.\n\nEager to end the war, the Trump administration signed a peace deal with the Taliban in February 2020 that paved the way for the withdrawal. President Joe Biden extended the deadline from May to August and continued with the pullout despite the Taliban's rapid blitz across the country earlier this month.\n\nNow the Taliban control all of Afghanistan except for the mountainous Panjshir province, where a few thousand local fighters and remnants of Afghanistan's collapsed security forces have pledged to resist them. The Taliban say they are seeking a peaceful resolution there.\n\nThey face much graver challenges now that they govern one of the poorest and most war-ravaged nations on Earth.\n\nIn recent days Afghans have lined up outside banks as an economic crisis that predates the Taliban takeover worsens. A string of attacks by the Islamic State extremist group's local affiliate, including a barrage of rockets fired at the airport Monday, shows the security challenges the Taliban face.\n\nOn Thursday, an Islamic State suicide attack at an airport gate killed at least 169 Afghans and 13 U.S. service members. The extremist group is far more radical than the Taliban, and the two groups have fought each other before. The Taliban say they will prevent Afghanistan from again being used as a base for terror attacks, a pledge that will likely be tested soon.\n\nMcKenzie said the Taliban were \"significantly helpful\" in enabling the airlift but will have difficulty securing Kabul in the coming days, not least because of the threat they face from IS. He said the Taliban had freed IS fighters from prisons, swelling their ranks to an estimated 2,000.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"Now they are going to be able to reap what they sowed,\" the American general said.\n\nMany Afghans fear the Taliban themselves, who governed the country under a harsh interpretation of Islamic law from 1996 until 2001. In those years they banned television and music, barred women from attending school or working outside the home, and carried out public executions.\n\nThe Taliban have sought to project a more moderate image since the takeover. They say women will be able to attend school and work, and have renounced any revenge attacks on Afghans who worked with the former government, the U.S. or its allies.\n\nMany Afghans are deeply skeptical of such promises, and fear of the Taliban's rule drove tens of thousands to flee the country over the past two weeks. Thousands more waited in vain outside the airport, many of them standing for hours in a sewage canal.\n\nThe Kabul international airport had been one of the few ways out. At one point people flooded onto the tarmac and seven fell to their deaths after clinging to a plane that was taking off. Another seven died in a stampede of people outside an airport gate.\n\nThe Taliban have said they will allow normal travel, but it is unclear how they will run the airport and which commercial carriers will begin flying in, given security concerns.\n\nQatar, a close U.S. ally that has long hosted a Taliban political office, has been taking part in negotiations about operations at the airport with Afghan and international parties, mainly the U.S. and Turkey. Qatari Assistant Foreign Minister Lolwa al-Khater said its main priority is restoring regular operations while maintaining security at the airport.\n\nThe last known U.S. military operation in Afghanistan came Sunday, when American officials said a drone strike blew up a vehicle carrying IS suicide bombers who were planning to attack the airport.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBut like so much about the Afghanistan war, it may not have gone as planned.\n\nRelatives of those killed in Sunday's strike said it killed civilians who had nothing to do with the extremist group.\n\nNajibullah Ismailzada said his brother-in-law, Zemarai Ahmadi, had just arrived home from his job working with a Korean charity. As he drove into the garage, his children came out to greet him, and that is when the missile struck.\n\n\"We lost 10 members of our family,\" Ismailzada said, including six children raging in age from 2 to 8. He said another relative, Naser Nejrabi, who was a former soldier in the Afghan army and a former interpreter for the U.S. military, also was killed, along with two teenagers.\n\nU.S. officials have acknowledged the reports of civilian casualties without confirming them.\n\nHours before the withdrawal was complete, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the U.S. military takes steps to avoid civilian casualties when carrying out targeted strikes.\n\n\"Of course, the loss of life from anywhere is horrible, and it impacts families no matter where they're living, in the United States or around the world,\" she said.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nTaliban fighters celebrated following the U.S. departure.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Multiple wildfires continued to burn as thousands stayed in evacuation centers across the West. [NATHAN HOWARD/AFP]\n\nUS President Donald Trump arrived in California on Monday for briefings on the devastating wildfires scorching the Western US, after criticism from his Democrat rivals on his alleged muted response to the disaster.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, in a speech that day, branded Trump a \"climate arsonist \"for failing to acknowledge the role of global warming in the disaster.\n\nWildfires across Oregon, California and Washington have destroyed thousands of homes and a half dozen small towns since August, scorching more than 1.6 million hectares and killing at least 35 people. Fifty are reported missing in Oregon alone.\n\nNearly 90 wildfires are raging across the Western US, including three of the largest wildfires in California's history.\n\nIn recent comments, Trump has said poor \"forest management\" was primarily to blame for the uncontrolled blazes.\n\nUpon his arrival in Sacramento to meet California Governor Gavin Newsom amid the smell of smoke in the air, Trump, in brushing off a reporter who asked if climate change was a factor in the fires, said: \"I think this is more of a management situation.\"\n\nCiting the experiences of other countries, he said: \"They have very explosive trees, but they don't have problems like this.\"\n\nBiden, criticized by Republicans for not visiting disaster areas, spoke from Delaware on the threat of extreme weather that climate scientists have said is supercharging fires.\n\n\"If we have four more years of Trump's climate denial, how many suburbs will be burned in wildfires?\" Biden asked. \"How many suburban neighborhoods will have been flooded out? How many suburbs will have been blown away in superstorms?\"\n\nIncreasing frequency\n\nWhile in California, the president maintained his long-standing position that global warming is a hoax that has little to with the increased frequency and severity of wildfires in recent years.\n\n\"It'll start getting cooler. You just watch,\" Trump on Monday told Wade Crowfoot, a top California state environmental official.\n\n\"I wish science agreed with you,\" Crowfoot responded.\n\n\"I don't think science knows, actually,\" the president said.\n\nCampaigning in Nevada over the weekend, Trump blamed forest management for the current crisis. Last month he threatened to withhold federal aid from California for not implementing his ideas on forest management.\n\nNewsom acknowledged that his state had not done enough to manage forests and that more than 100 years of fire suppression had allowed fuel to build up.\n\nBut he said global warming was driving fires and told Trump that 57 percent of forests in the state were under federal management and that only 3 percent of land in California was under state control.\n\n\"We've known each other too long, and as you suggest, (we have a) working relationship I value,\" Newsom told Trump. \"We obviously feel very strongly that the hots are getting hotter. The dries are getting drier.\"\n\nNewsom continued: \"And so I think there's an area of at least commonality on vegetation, forest management. But please respect－and I know you do－the difference of opinion out here as it relates to this fundamental issue on the issue of climate change.\"\n\nTrump, who has authorized federal disaster aid for California and Oregon, questioned that science.\n\nTrump announced in 2017 that he would begin to pull the US out of the Paris Agreement on combating global warming. Biden says climate change is on his list of major crises facing the US.\n\n\"Talk to a firefighter if you think that climate change isn't real,\" said Democratic Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti on CNN's State of the Union on Sunday. \"It seems like this administration are the last vestiges of the Flat Earth Society of this generation.\"\n\nIn 2018, a major scientific report issued by 13 federal agencies concluded that greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels could triple the frequency of severe fires across the US West and could reduce the national economy by as much as 10 percent by the end of the century.\n\nAgencies contributed to this story.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nTrump authorized federal disaster aid for California and Oregon.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Did you know, for example, ChatGPT needs to do an internet search to look up events later than June 2024?\n\nSome of the most surprising information about AI chatbots can help us understand how they work, what they can and can't do, and so how to use them in a better way.\n\nWith that in mind, here are five things you ought to know about these breakthrough machines.\n\nRelated: Does Using Artificial Intelligence Ruin Your Actual Intelligence? Scientists Investigated\n\n1. They are trained by human feedback\n\nAI chatbots are trained in multiple stages, beginning with something called pre-training, where models are trained to predict the next word in massive text datasets. This allows them to develop a general understanding of language, facts and reasoning.\n\nIf asked: \"How do I make a homemade explosive?\" in the pre-training phase, a model might have given a detailed instruction. To make them useful and safe for conversation, human \"annotators\" help guide the models toward safer and more helpful responses, a process called alignment.\n\nAfter alignment, an AI chatbot might answer something like: \"I'm sorry, but I can't provide that information. If you have safety concerns or need help with legal chemistry experiments, I recommend referring to certified educational sources.\"\n\nWithout alignment, AI chatbots would be unpredictable, potentially spreading misinformation or harmful content. This highlights the crucial role of human intervention in shaping AI behavior.\n\nOpenAI, the company which developed ChatGPT, has not disclosed how many employees have trained ChatGPT for how many hours. But it is clear that AI chatbots, like ChatGPT, need a moral compass so that it does not spread harmful information. Human annotators rank responses to ensure neutrality and ethical alignment.\n\nSimilarly, if an AI chatbot was asked: \"What are the best and worst nationalities?\"\n\nHuman annotators would rank a response like this the highest: \"Every nationality has its own rich culture, history, and contributions to the world. There is no 'best' or 'worst' nationality – each one is valuable in its own way.\"\n\n2. They don't learn through words – but with the help of tokens\n\nHumans naturally learn language through words, whereas AI chatbots rely on smaller units called tokens. These units can be words, subwords or obscure series of characters.\n\nWhile tokenization generally follows logical patterns, it can sometimes produce unexpected splits, revealing both the strengths and quirks of how AI chatbots interpret language. Modern AI chatbots' vocabularies typically consist of 50,000 to 100,000 tokens.\n\nThe sentence \"The price is $9.99.\" is tokenized by ChatGPT as \"The\", \" price\", \"is\", \"$\" \" 9″, \".\", \"99\", whereas \"ChatGPT is marvellous\" is tokenized less intuitively: \"chat\", \"G\", \"PT\", \" is\", \"mar\", \"vellous\".\n\n3. Their knowledge is outdated every passing day\n\nAI chatbots do not continuously update themselves; hence, they may struggle with recent events, new terminology or broadly anything after their knowledge cutoff. A knowledge cut-off refers to the last point in time when an AI chatbot's training data was updated, meaning it lacks awareness of events, trends or discoveries beyond that date.\n\nThe current version of ChatGPT has its cutoff on June 2024. If asked who is the currently president of the United States, ChatGPT would need to perform a web search using the search engine Bing, \"read\" the results, and return an answer.\n\nBing results are filtered by relevance and reliability of the source. Likewise, other AI chatbots uses web search to return up-to-date answers.\n\nUpdating AI chatbots is a costly and fragile process. How to efficiently update their knowledge is still an open scientific problem. ChatGPT's knowledge is believed to be updated as Open AI introduces new ChatGPT versions.\n\n4. They hallucinate really easily\n\nAI chatbots sometimes \"hallucinate\", generating false or nonsensical claims with confidence because they predict text based on patterns rather than verifying facts. These errors stem from the way they work: they optimize for coherence over accuracy, rely on imperfect training data and lack real world understanding.\n\nWhile improvements such as fact-checking tools (for example, like ChatGPT's Bing search tool integration for real-time fact-checking) or prompts (for example, explicitly telling ChatGPT to \"cite peer-reviewed sources\" or \"say I don ́t know if you are not sure\") reduce hallucinations, they can't fully eliminate them.\n\nFor example, when asked what the main findings are of a particular research paper, ChatGPT gives a long, detailed and good-looking answer.\n\nIt also included screenshots and even a link, but from the wrong academic papers. So users should treat AI-generated information as a starting point, not an unquestionable truth.\n\n5. They use calculators to do maths\n\nA recently popularized feature of AI chatbots is called reasoning. Reasoning refers to the process of using logically connected intermediate steps to solve complex problems. This is also known as \"chain of thought\" reasoning.\n\nInstead of jumping directly to an answer, chain of thought enables AI chatbots to think step by step. For example, when asked \"what is 56,345 minus 7,865 times 350,468\", ChatGPT gives the right answer. It \"understands\" that the multiplication needs to occur before the subtraction.\n\nTo solve the intermediate steps, ChatGPT uses its built-in calculator that enables precise arithmetic. This hybrid approach of combining internal reasoning with the calculator helps improve reliability in complex tasks.\n\nÇağatay Yıldız, Postdoctoral Researcher, Cluster of Excellence \" Machine Learning\", University of Tübingen\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

No Russian general was seen going so close to danger.\n\nPrigozhin claimed his troops were being starved of ammunition by another of Putin’s trusted inner circle, Russia’s Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu.\n\nThe Wagner boss’s obvious hatred of Shoigu had developed into a festering turf war over who would control Wagner. At stake were the vast money-making ventures Prigozhin developed and owned for the Kremlin in Africa and beyond.\n\nPutin, whose hitherto iron-fisted rule relies on manipulating his inner circle’s interests to keep them in line, should have shut the feud down sooner.\n\nWhat the Russian public was hearing from Prigozhin, about how badly the war was going, was dangerous for Putin. The renegade mercenary boss’s regular diatribes about a screwed-up, lying military leadership were seeds of dissent falling on fertile soil.\n\nPrigozhin’s miscalculation was how fertile that soil was, or more specifically which bits weren’t.\n\nNot only had his message been gaining traction with the public, he’d also been drawing support from top military ranks. At the end of April, he recruited Deputy Defense Minister Mikhail Mizintsev direct from the Kremlin.\n\nAnother top defense official, Sergey Surovkin, who for a while last year was put in charge of Russia’s war in Ukraine, was a favorite of Prigozhin. “This is the only person with the star of the General of the Army who knows how to fight,” Prigozhin said, at the height of his spat with the defense ministry in Moscow.\n\nRumors were the respect was reciprocated.\n\nAround the same time Putin’s massively powerful and vital ally Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov heaped praise on Prigozhin’s troops. “The Wagner PMC has very good, courageous, necessary, necessary people,” Kadyrov said.\n\nAs Prigozhin threatened to pull his forces from the front lines Kadyrov was trying to mediate. “If you stay with us,” Kadyrov said, “I promise you that we will give you more, create better conditions, than you have today. We will try to make everything top notch for you.”\n\nAt 9 p.m. Friday night, Prigozhin claimed he met with Shoigu. What they discussed is still unknown. Shoigu left abruptly. Hours later, Prigozhin said he wasn’t budging till Shoigu came back to talk, and in the meantime said he had dispatched a fighting force to Moscow.\n\n## ‘Treacherous’ Prigozhin\n\nLate Saturday morning, as Prigozhin was still holed up in the Russian military headquarters in Rostov-on-Don, Kadyrov played kingmakers’ hand: “What is happening is not an ultimatum to the Ministry of Defense. This is a challenge to the state, and against this challenge it is necessary to rally around the national leader,” he declared.\n\nHe called Prigozhin “treacherous” and said he was sending his special forces to rout the mercenary boss. The walls were closing in.\n\nAny thought Prigozhin might rally Russian army generals to his cause was evaporating too. Hours earlier, Surovkin, the only general he valued, released a video message telling him to “stop” and to “obey the will” of President Vladimir Putin.\n\nFacing a potential Alamo, Prigozhin appeared to negotiate his way out on Saturday afternoon – or at least, he thought he did.\n\nPrigozhin claimed he called off his march on Moscow to save “Russian blood,” but the reality was that his neck was on the line.\n\nPutin, fabled for rewarding loyalty and punishing the disloyal, had only hours earlier accused Prigozhin of “treason” and “armed rebellion.” Now, he hid behind a diplomatic fig leaf, allowing his weak Belarus neighbor and supplicant, President Alexander Lukashenko, to announce an amnesty and sanctuary for Prigozhin.\n\nBut by Monday, that amnesty appeared to have evaporated. Russian state media said charges against Prigozhin had not been dropped, and since Belarus is an enfeebled client of Russia, it can surely offer little safety for Prigozhin.\n\nIf the Wagner boss does have any leverage left, it is bundled up in his shady diamond, gold and other dealings with Kremlin clients he helped recruit in Mali, Central African Republic, Sudan and Libya.\n\nSuch currency rarely holds its value long.\n\nPrigozhin’s world is a much smaller and more dangerous place now, but there can be little satisfaction for Putin in this as his empire is the most fragile it’s been since he consolidated his power from a wholly different group of oligarchs two decades ago.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nPrigozhin went into exile in Belarus.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

It is not difficult to imagine how, once Trump is no longer President, his most fanatical supporters could apply this caveat to all levels of government, including local law enforcement. At the rally on December 12th, Nicholas Fuentes underscored the irreconcilability of a radical-right ethos and pro-police, pro-military patriotism: “When they go door to door mandating vaccines, when they go door to door taking your firearms, when they go door to door taking your children, who do you think it will be that’s going to do that? It’s going to be the police and the military.”\n\nDuring Trump’s speech on January 6th, he said, “The media is the biggest problem we have.” He went on, “It’s become the enemy of the people. . . . We gotta get them straightened out.” Several journalists were attacked during the siege. Men assaulted a Times photographer inside the Capitol, near the rotunda, as she screamed for help. After National Guard soldiers and federal agents finally arrived and expelled the Trump supporters, some members of the mob shifted their attention to television crews in a park on the east side of the building. Earlier, a man had accosted an Israeli journalist in the middle of a live broadcast, calling him a “lying Israeli” and telling him, “You are cattle today.” Now the Trump supporters surrounded teams from the Associated Press and other outlets, chasing off the reporters and smashing their equipment with bats and sticks.\n\nThere was a ritualistic atmosphere as the crowd stood in a circle around the piled-up cameras, lights, and tripods. “This is the old media,” a man said, through a megaphone. “This is what it looks like. Turn off Fox, turn off CNN.”\n\nOutside the Capitol, rioters surrounded news crews, chasing off the reporters and smashing their equipment with bats. Photograph by Balazs Gardi for The New Yorker\n\nAnother man, in a black leather jacket and wraparound sunglasses, suggested that journalists should be killed: “Start makin’ a list! Put all those names down, and we start huntin’ them down, one by one!”\n\n“Traitors to the guillotine!”\n\n“They won’t be able to walk down the streets!”\n\nThe radicalization of the Republican Party has altered the world of conservative media, which is, in turn, accelerating that radicalization. On November 7th, Fox News, which has often seemed to function as a civilian branch of the Trump Administration, called the race for Biden, along with every other major network. Furious, Trump encouraged his supporters to instead watch Newsmax, whose ratings skyrocketed as a result. Newsmax hosts have dismissed covid-19 as a “scamdemic” and have speculated that Republican politicians were being infected with the virus as a form of “sabotage.” The Newsmax headliner Michelle Malkin has praised Fuentes as one of the “New Right leaders” and the groypers as “patriotic.”\n\nAt the December 12th rally, I ran into the Pennsylvania Three Percent member whom I’d met in Harrisburg on November 7th. Then he had been a Fox News devotee, but since Election Day he’d discovered Newsmax. “I’d had no idea what it even was,” he told me. “Now the only thing that anyone I know watches anymore is Newsmax. They ask the hard questions.”\n\nIt seems unlikely that what happened on January 6th will turn anyone who inhabits such an ecosystem against Trump. On the contrary, there are already indications that the mayhem at the Capitol will further isolate and galvanize many right-wingers. The morning after the siege, an alternative narrative, pushed by Jones and other conspiracists, went viral on Parler: the assault on the Capitol had actually been instigated by Antifa agitators impersonating Trump supporters. Mo Brooks, an Alabama congressman who led the House effort to contest the certification of the Electoral College votes, tweeted, “Evidence growing that fascist ANTIFA orchestrated Capitol attack with clever mob control tactics.” (Brooks had warmed up the crowd for Trump on January 6th, with a speech whose bellicosity far surpassed the President’s. “Today is the day American patriots start takin’ down names and kickin’ ass!” he’d hollered.) Most of the “evidence” of Antifa involvement seems to be photographs of rioters clad in black. Never mind that, in early January, Tarrio, the Proud Boys chairman, wrote on Parler, “We might dress in all BLACK for the occasion.” Or that his colleague Joe Biggs, addressing antifascist activists, added, “We are going to smell like you, move like you, and look like you.”\n\nNot long after the Brooks tweet, I got a call from a woman I’d met at previous Stop the Steal rallies. She had been unable to come to D.C., owing to a recent surgery. She asked if I could tell her what I’d seen, and if the stories about Antifa were accurate. She was upset—she did not believe that “Trump people” could have done what the media were alleging. Before I responded, she put me on speakerphone. I could hear other people in the room. We spoke for a while, and it was plain that they desperately wanted to know the truth. I did my best to convey it to them as I understood it.\n\nLess than an hour after we got off the phone, the woman texted me a screenshot of a CNN broadcast with a news bulletin that read, “antifa has taken responsiblitly for storming capital hill.” The image, which had been circulating on social media, was crudely Photoshopped (and poorly spelled). “Thought you might want to see this,” she wrote.\n\nIn the year 2088, a five-hundred-pound time capsule is scheduled to be exhumed from beneath the stone slabs of Freedom Plaza. Inside an aluminum cylinder, historians will find relics honoring the legacy of Martin Luther King, Jr.: a Bible, clerical robes, a cassette tape with King’s “I Have a Dream” speech, part of which he wrote in a nearby hotel. What will those historians know about the lasting consequences of the 2020 Presidential election, which culminated with the incumbent candidate inciting his supporters to storm the Capitol and threaten to lynch his adversaries? Will this year’s campaign against the democratic process have evolved into a durable insurgency? Something worse?\n\nOn January 8th, Trump was permanently banned from Twitter. Five days later, he became the only U.S. President in history to be impeached twice. (During the Capitol siege, the man in the hard hat withdrew from one of the Senate desks a manual, from a year ago, titled “PROCEEDINGS OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE IN THE IMPEACHMENT TRIAL OF PRESIDENT DONALD JOHN TRUMP.”) Although the President has finally agreed to submit to a peaceful transition of power, he has admitted no responsibility for the deadly riot. “People thought that what I said was totally appropriate,” he told reporters on January 12th.\n\nHe will not disappear. Neither will the baleful forces that he has conjured and awakened. This is why iconoclasts like Fuentes and Jones have often seemed more exultant than angry since Election Day. For them, the disappointment of Trump’s defeat has been eclipsed by the prospect of upheaval that it has brought about. As Fuentes said on the “InfoWars” panel, “This is the best thing that can happen, because it’s destroying the legitimacy of the system.” Fuentes was at the Capitol riot, though he denies going inside. On his show the next day, he called the siege “the most awe-inspiring and inspirational and incredible thing I have seen in my entire life.”\n\nAt the heap of wrecked camera gear outside the Capitol, the man in the leather jacket and sunglasses declared to the crowd, “We are at war. . . . Mobilize in your own cities, your own counties. Storm your own capitol buildings. And take down every one of these corrupt motherfuckers.” Behind him, lights glowed in the rotunda. The sky darkened. At 8 p.m., Congress reconvened and resumed certifying the election. For six hours, Americans had held democracy hostage in the name of patriotism.\n\nThe storm might be here. ♦\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nTrump was impeached for a second time on January 13th.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Five police officers suffered slight injuries, and one was severely injured. Another five gendarmes were hurt as well.\n\nProtesters wearing yellow vests demonstrate on the Promenade des Anglais in Nice, southern France, on Saturday. Eric Gaillard/Reuters\n\nSpeaking about the death, French Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said: “That’s the reason why we were worried to have people (who are) not experienced organizing protests.”\n\nEcology Minister François de Rugy called on citizens to “respect caution and safety recommendations” in order for protests to go ahead “without a new tragedy,” in a tweet Saturday. He also offered his condolences to the family of the victim.\n\nMore than 1 million people were expected to turn out Saturday for demonstrations across the country. Partway through the day, the numbers were much lower than that.\n\nAbout 280,000 people participated in more than 2,000 demonstrations, the Interior Ministry said.\n\n“Honestly we’re satisfied, even if it’s true we are not hundreds of thousands people here, but still, people have come. The day is not over yet, and we’re glad that there are no incidents here,” Thierry Paul Valette, who helped organize a protest on the Champs Elysées in Paris, told CNN.\n\n“We can’t stand Macron’s taxes any more. It’s too much. We couldn’t make ourselves heard through political parties or trade unions, so we had to do something.”\n\nPeople wearing yellow vests block the motorway in Antibes, southeastern France, on Saturday. Eric Gaillard/Reuters\n\nThe protest was billed as likely to be one of the toughest tests yet of Emmanuel Macron’s 18-month-old presidency.\n\nWebsite blocage17novembre said protests were planned in all 95 of France’s mainland departments, while a petition on change.org calling on the French government to lower the cost of fuel has gotten more than 850,000 signatures.\n\nIn addition to concerns over spiraling fuel prices, the protests also reflect long-running tensions between the metropolitan elite and rural poor.\n\nPrice hike\n\nDiesel prices have surged 16% this year from an average 1.24 euros ($1.41) per liter to 1.48 euros ($1.69), even hitting 1.53 euros in October, according to UFIP, France’s oil industry federation.\n\nThe price hike is largely caused by a leap in the wholesale price of oil, with Brent crude oil – a benchmark for worldwide oil purchases – increasing by more than 20% in the first half of 2018 from around $60 a barrel to a peak of $86.07 in early October.\n\nA protest against rising fuel and oil prices takes place in Nice, southeastern France, on November 15. VALERY HACHE/AFP/Getty Images\n\nFrench protesters are, however, not directing their anger at OPEC for reducing oil production, or at the US administration for implementing tariffs on Iran, crippling its oil exports.\n\nMacron is instead bearing the brunt of widespread French discontent, with many protesters furious at the current leader’s extension of environmental policies implemented under François Hollande’s government.\n\nNotably, taxes were increased by 8 centimes last January on diesel, and by 4 centimes on petrol. Tax on diesel will also increase by another 6.4 centimes in 2019, and by 2.9 centimes for petrol. These rises follow many decades of under-taxation of diesel in France.\n\nMacron criticized\n\nThe growing resentment has also been a springboard for partisan political attacks, with opponents of Macron’s centrist En Marche party attempting to energize their bases to fuel further revolt.\n\n“This government hasn’t understood the anger of the French,” Olivier Faure, head of the French Socialist Party, said Wednesday.\n\n“Macron has not heard the French,” Laurent Wauquiez, leader of the center-right party Les Républicains, added in an interview for BFMTV and RMC radio.\n\nMeanwhile, Macron’s former nemesis, Marine Le Pen, leader of France’s far-right National Rally, said: “We were the first party to express our total support for this movement.”\n\nCastaner hit back at Macron’s opponents, branding the protests “political” and accusing Les Républicains of being behind them.\n\n“It’s a political protest with the Republicans behind it, and it’s irrational because the rising taxes have been compensated by the decline in the oil market,” he told CNN’s French affiliate BFMTV. “We hear the protests, we hear the anger, I know the situation, but we have to explain that it’s essential that we exit fossil fuels.”\n\nThe minister said police would be present to break up any dangerous roadblocks. “I am asking for the roads to not be completely blocked,” Castaner said. “Where there is a roadblock – which means there’s a risk for emergency services – there will be police.”\n\nMacron struck a more conciliatory tone in an interview Wednesday, saying: “I hear the anger, and it’s a fundamental right in our society to be allowed to express it.”\n\nHe nevertheless admitted that he was “wary because many different people are trying to piggyback on this movement.”\n\nPrime Minister Edouard Philippe also announced close to 500 million euros in aid to low-income motorists in a key concession Wednesday.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\n130 people were arrested across France, including 42 in Paris.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Mongabay had exclusive access to the report ahead of release.\n\nAt least 125,000 hectares (310,000 acres) of the Brazilian Amazon — the equivalent to 172,000 soccer fields — were cleared through 2019 and then burned in August. The findings offer a base map overlapping 2019 deforestation and fire hotspots, and include 16 high-resolution time lapse videos unveiling newly cleared agricultural lands linked to fire occurrences.\n\nMAAP’s findings show that the dramatic photos that garnered worldwide attention of smoky fires sweeping the Brazilian Amazon in August do not correspond with burning rainforest, but instead coincide with areas intentionally deforested this year, with the cleared land then set ablaze to finish the agricultural conversion process.\n\nAlthough the report didn’t detect major forest fires in Brazil to date, the risk still exists, as the dry season deepens, given that many fire occurrences were detected on agriculture-forest boundaries. The study doesn’t say how much of the 125,000 hectares cleared in the first 8 months of 2019 were illegally deforested. See All Key Ideas\n\nThe dramatic photos of smoky fires sweeping through the Brazilian Amazon that garnered worldwide attention in August do not correspond to burning rainforest, but instead mostly correlate to land that was deforested earlier in 2019 and was then set ablaze in August to complete the land’s conversion for agricultural use, according to a report released today by the Monitoring of the Andean Amazon Project (MAAP). Mongabay had exclusive access to the report ahead of its release.\n\nAt least 125,000 hectares (310,000 acres) — the equivalent to 172,000 soccer fields — were cleared of forest earlier in 2019, and then burned in August, the report showed. The majority of the occurrences were observed in the northern state of Amazonas, which accounted alone for 39,100 hectares (96,618 acres), or about 30 percent of the total cleared-and-burned areas. Major deforested-and-burned lands were also detected in the northern states of Rondônia and Pará, where fire hotspots were also prominent in August.\n\nThe findings offer the first known base map linking 2019 deforestation and fire hotspots, and were presented with supporting evidence utilizing 16 high-resolution time lapse videos unveiling the process of forest clearing and overlapping fire occurrences in the northern Amazon region.\n\nBase map showing overlapping 2019 deforestation and fire hotspots in Brazil. Orange areas show that at least 125,000 hectares (310,000 acres) — the equivalent to 172,000 soccer fields — were cleared through 2019 and then burned in August in the Brazilian Amazon. Source: MAAP\n\nThe base map included two key data layers: 2019 forest loss alerts from GLAD, the Global Land Analysis & Discovery lab at the University of Maryland, and 2019 fire alerts from NASA, revealing the critical overlap between deforestation and the blazes. MAAP researchers then zoomed in on select areas by analyzing high-resolution satellite imagery from Planet and the European Space Agency (Sentinel-2), and created striking time lapse videos using Planet’s website.\n\nTime lapse video above shows deforestation followed by fire in the Brazilian state of Rondônia, in the Amazon region. Data: Planet, ESA.\n\nTime lapse video above shows deforestation followed by fire in the Brazilian state of Pará, in the Amazon. Data: Planet, ESA.\n\n“The major issue is deforestation… Now it makes sense why the fires were so smoky… It looks like a forest fire, it’s smoky as a forest fire [would be], but it’s burning recent deforested areas… The whole key was to look at the archive satellite imagery through 2019. We got much more information than a simple photo,” said Matt Finer, senior research specialist and director of MAAP, an initiative of Amazon Conservation, Conservación Amazónica (ACCA).\n\n“We are not minimizing the importance of the fires, but our findings are showing that deforestation is also the critical issue,” Finer told Mongabay. “The world needs to be as upset and alert to deforestation as they were to fires, because the deforestation is how this whole system, this whole process is starting… We need the same attention and awareness that there was with the fires in terms of deforestation because both go together.”\n\nTime lapse video above shows deforestation followed by fire in the Brazilian state of Amazonas, in the Amazon region. Data: Planet, ESA.\n\nIn August, tens of thousands of active fires ravaged the Amazon region and triggered an international outcry, with protesters in Brazil and around the world demanding effective action from President Jair Bolsonaro to curb the blazes. The Amazon fires came into the spotlight after São Paulo’s skies suddenly turned black with smoke on August 19, prompting an outpouring of concern across social media worldwide under the #PrayforAmazonas hashtag, which reached more than 300,000 tweets in just two days.\n\nBolsonaro immediately reacted, suggesting, without any proof, that NGOs could be behind the fires as a retaliation against the government because of the suspension of a $33.2 million payment from Norway to the Amazon Fund.\n\nExperts promptly highlighted the link between deforestation and the fires, given the lack of severe drought this year. According to their analysis, the forest-to-pasture conversion strategy of ranchers in the Brazilian Amazon is to cut rainforest trees, allow the wood to dry, then set it ablaze to fully clear the land and produce ashes to fertilize the soil to grow grass for grazing — a process apparently given scientific weight by the MAAP findings.\n\nThe new findings also seem to support accusations by Bolsonaro critics, that his inflammatory rhetoric during and after the 2018 election, emboldened ranchers to begin clearing Amazon forest once the new president took office in January 2019.\n\nIn fact, Brazilian authorities are currently investigating a group of some 70 farmers and land grabbers in Pará state who allegedly organized a “Day of Fire” on August 10 in support of Bolsonaro and his measures easing environmental enforcement in the country, Globo Rural magazine reported.\n\nIncreasing risk\n\nAlthough MAAP’s analysis didn’t detect major forest fires in Brazil to date, the risk still exists as the dry season deepens, given that many fire occurrences were detected on agriculture-forest boundaries, Finer explained.\n\n“The fires… hit the forest line and [seemed] to go out, but [they’re] still impacting the edge of the forest… And these fires burning recently cleared areas can very easily become forest fires. We haven’t seen this yet this year in the moist forest in Brazil, but as the dry season continues, or if there is a [worsening] drought year, then this process of burning recent deforested land will get much, much worse and we could see major forest fires,” he warned.\n\nSo far, MAAP has detected major fires hitting native vegetation only in drier ecosystems, including the dry forest of Bolivia and Brazil’s Cerrado savanna.\n\nThe report also includes high-resolution time lapse videos of fires within the Kayapó and Munduruku indigenous territories, where Finer assumes they were set to regenerate grass for cattle pasture. The area burned within the two indigenous reserves totaled 24,000 hectares (60,000 acres) and 700 hectares (1,700 acres), respectively. The report also detected recent fire on ridges within the Kayapó territory, in northern Roraima state, that have burned some 930 hectares (2,300 acres).\n\nTime lapse video above shows savanna fire within the Kayapó indigenous territory. Data: Planet, ESA.\n\n“When we look at the dry forest in Bolivia, there we did see what everyone had in mind: fires that were out of control, burning natural ecosystems. But in Brazil every time we zoomed in on a fire, we saw the fire burning an already cleared deforestation area.

Satellite data from Brazil's National Institute of Space Research shows that there have been more than 74,000 fires this year, many of them in the Amazon. The demonstrations are \"in defense of the Amazon and our future,\" according to organizers.\n\nOver the past few days, international pressure has been steadily growing on Bolsonaro over his handling of the issue, especially from European leaders. A spokesman for Britain's newly installed prime minister, Boris Johnson, said he was \"deeply concerned\" about the fires and \"the impact of the tragic loss of these precious habitats.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron plans to highlight the Amazon crisis at this weekend's G-7 summit in Biarritz, France, after sending out a tweet describing them as \"an international crisis\" and declaring: \"Our house is burning. Literally. The Amazon rain forest — the lungs which produces 20% of the planet's oxygen — is on fire.\"\n\nMacron raised the pressure on Brazil on Friday, issuing a statement accusing Bolsonaro of lying to him about his position on climate change and announcing that France has withdrawn its support for the Mercosur trade deal between the European Union and a South American bloc that includes Brazil. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar warned that Ireland would pull out of the Mercosur agreement if Brazil did not take action to protect the rainforest, according to Reuters.\n\nBolsonaro has made clear that he considers the Amazon rainforest — 60% of which is in Brazil — to be an issue of national sovereignty, and he makes no secret of his resentment at what he deems to be foreign interference driven by a desire to hold back Brazilian agrobusiness from competing in international markets.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption AP AP\n\nIn recent weeks, he has alienated Germany and Norway, the two main contributors to the Amazon Fund, which supports forest preservation initiatives, prompting them to withhold tens of millions of dollars.\n\nHis approach has won applause from his supporters on the far right, but is also causing widespread fears among Brazilians that it is proving highly damaging to the country's international standing and may prompt a backlash that could impact exports.\n\n\"The image of the burning forest ignites public opinion and incinerates Brazil's reputation,\" wrote Ana Lucia Azevedo, a columnist for O Globo. She warns that the crisis is wrecking \"the prestige and credibility\" acquired by Brazil after 2005, when deforestation rates dipped sharply.\n\nAnother commentator, Vinicius Torrer Freire, wrote: \"Within a few months, especially in recent weeks, he has knocked down two decades of improvements in Brazil's international image regarding the environment.\"\n\nBolsonaro argues that it is possible simultaneously to develop the Amazon and preserve the forest. His critics point to his record of relentlessly undermining institutions responsible for preserving and monitoring the Amazon.\n\nSince taking office in January, he has severely weakened government environmental enforcement organizations, by cutting budgets and laying off staff. When Brazil's National Institute of Space Research released satellite data showing a sharp month-on-month rise in deforestation over last year, Bolsonaro dismissed this as \"lies\" and replaced the director with a military official.\n\nLatin America Brazil's Amazon Rainforest Is Disappearing Under President Jair Bolsonaro Brazil's Amazon Rainforest Is Disappearing Under President Jair Bolsonaro Listen · 7:57 7:57\n\nHis approach is causing deep concern among professionals fighting to protect the forest, who argue that these moves send the wrong message to illegal deforesters.\n\n\"They feel emboldened to carry out more deforestation,\" said Fluvio Mascarenhas, who works for the Chico Mendes Institute for the Conversation of Biodiversity — a government monitoring agency — in the western state of Acre.\n\nIn a recent interview with NPR, Mascarenhas expressed profound concern about the impact of Bolsonaro's policies.\n\n\"Every time you look at a satellite image of the forest, you see another little piece is missing,\" he said.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nPresident Bolsonaro announced a 60-day ban on setting fires for land clearing and deployed 44,000 soldiers to seven states.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Mongabay had exclusive access to the report ahead of release.\n\nAt least 125,000 hectares (310,000 acres) of the Brazilian Amazon — the equivalent to 172,000 soccer fields — were cleared through 2019 and then burned in August. The findings offer a base map overlapping 2019 deforestation and fire hotspots, and include 16 high-resolution time lapse videos unveiling newly cleared agricultural lands linked to fire occurrences.\n\nMAAP’s findings show that the dramatic photos that garnered worldwide attention of smoky fires sweeping the Brazilian Amazon in August do not correspond with burning rainforest, but instead coincide with areas intentionally deforested this year, with the cleared land then set ablaze to finish the agricultural conversion process.\n\nAlthough the report didn’t detect major forest fires in Brazil to date, the risk still exists, as the dry season deepens, given that many fire occurrences were detected on agriculture-forest boundaries. The study doesn’t say how much of the 125,000 hectares cleared in the first 8 months of 2019 were illegally deforested. See All Key Ideas\n\nThe dramatic photos of smoky fires sweeping through the Brazilian Amazon that garnered worldwide attention in August do not correspond to burning rainforest, but instead mostly correlate to land that was deforested earlier in 2019 and was then set ablaze in August to complete the land’s conversion for agricultural use, according to a report released today by the Monitoring of the Andean Amazon Project (MAAP). Mongabay had exclusive access to the report ahead of its release.\n\nAt least 125,000 hectares (310,000 acres) — the equivalent to 172,000 soccer fields — were cleared of forest earlier in 2019, and then burned in August, the report showed. The majority of the occurrences were observed in the northern state of Amazonas, which accounted alone for 39,100 hectares (96,618 acres), or about 30 percent of the total cleared-and-burned areas. Major deforested-and-burned lands were also detected in the northern states of Rondônia and Pará, where fire hotspots were also prominent in August.\n\nThe findings offer the first known base map linking 2019 deforestation and fire hotspots, and were presented with supporting evidence utilizing 16 high-resolution time lapse videos unveiling the process of forest clearing and overlapping fire occurrences in the northern Amazon region.\n\nBase map showing overlapping 2019 deforestation and fire hotspots in Brazil.

Source: MAAP\n\nThe base map included two key data layers: 2019 forest loss alerts from GLAD, the Global Land Analysis & Discovery lab at the University of Maryland, and 2019 fire alerts from NASA, revealing the critical overlap between deforestation and the blazes. MAAP researchers then zoomed in on select areas by analyzing high-resolution satellite imagery from Planet and the European Space Agency (Sentinel-2), and created striking time lapse videos using Planet’s website.\n\nTime lapse video above shows deforestation followed by fire in the Brazilian state of Rondônia, in the Amazon region.

Data: Planet, ESA.\n\n“The major issue is deforestation… Now it makes sense why the fires were so smoky… It looks like a forest fire, it’s smoky as a forest fire [would be], but it’s burning recent deforested areas… The whole key was to look at the archive satellite imagery through 2019. We got much more information than a simple photo,” said Matt Finer, senior research specialist and director of MAAP, an initiative of Amazon Conservation, Conservación Amazónica (ACCA).\n\n“We are not minimizing the importance of the fires, but our findings are showing that deforestation is also the critical issue,” Finer told Mongabay. “The world needs to be as upset and alert to deforestation as they were to fires, because the deforestation is how this whole system, this whole process is starting… We need the same attention and awareness that there was with the fires in terms of deforestation because both go together.”\n\nTime lapse video above shows deforestation followed by fire in the Brazilian state of Amazonas, in the Amazon region. Data: Planet, ESA.\n\nIn August, tens of thousands of active fires ravaged the Amazon region and triggered an international outcry, with protesters in Brazil and around the world demanding effective action from President Jair Bolsonaro to curb the blazes. The Amazon fires came into the spotlight after São Paulo’s skies suddenly turned black with smoke on August 19, prompting an outpouring of concern across social media worldwide under the #PrayforAmazonas hashtag, which reached more than 300,000 tweets in just two days.\n\nBolsonaro immediately reacted, suggesting, without any proof, that NGOs could be behind the fires as a retaliation against the government because of the suspension of a $33.2 million payment from Norway to the Amazon Fund.\n\nExperts promptly highlighted the link between deforestation and the fires, given the lack of severe drought this year. According to their analysis, the forest-to-pasture conversion strategy of ranchers in the Brazilian Amazon is to cut rainforest trees, allow the wood to dry, then set it ablaze to fully clear the land and produce ashes to fertilize the soil to grow grass for grazing — a process apparently given scientific weight by the MAAP findings.\n\nThe new findings also seem to support accusations by Bolsonaro critics, that his inflammatory rhetoric during and after the 2018 election, emboldened ranchers to begin clearing Amazon forest once the new president took office in January 2019.\n\nIn fact, Brazilian authorities are currently investigating a group of some 70 farmers and land grabbers in Pará state who allegedly organized a “Day of Fire” on August 10 in support of Bolsonaro and his measures easing environmental enforcement in the country, Globo Rural magazine reported.\n\nIncreasing risk\n\nAlthough MAAP’s analysis didn’t detect major forest fires in Brazil to date, the risk still exists as the dry season deepens, given that many fire occurrences were detected on agriculture-forest boundaries, Finer explained.\n\n“The fires… hit the forest line and [seemed] to go out, but [they’re] still impacting the edge of the forest… And these fires burning recently cleared areas can very easily become forest fires. We haven’t seen this yet this year in the moist forest in Brazil, but as the dry season continues, or if there is a [worsening] drought year, then this process of burning recent deforested land will get much, much worse and we could see major forest fires,” he warned.\n\nSo far, MAAP has detected major fires hitting native vegetation only in drier ecosystems, including the dry forest of Bolivia and Brazil’s Cerrado savanna.\n\nThe report also includes high-resolution time lapse videos of fires within the Kayapó and Munduruku indigenous territories, where Finer assumes they were set to regenerate grass for cattle pasture. The area burned within the two indigenous reserves totaled 24,000 hectares (60,000 acres) and 700 hectares (1,700 acres), respectively. The report also detected recent fire on ridges within the Kayapó territory, in northern Roraima state, that have burned some 930 hectares (2,300 acres).\n\nTime lapse video above shows savanna fire within the Kayapó indigenous territory. Data: Planet, ESA.\n\n“When we look at the dry forest in Bolivia, there we did see what everyone had in mind: fires that were out of control, burning natural ecosystems. But in Brazil every time we zoomed in on a fire, we saw the fire burning an already cleared deforestation area. We just never saw a fire, out of control fires, sweeping through the rainforest [in August],” Finer explained.\n\nIn the preliminary version of the report — also obtained exclusively by Mongabay ahead of its release on September 11 — the area cleared and then burned totaled 52,500 hectares (equivalent to 72,000 soccer fields).\n\nBack in March, MAAP did detect major forest fires in northern Roraima state, including fires near the Yanomami indigenous territory.

This column by former Mayor John Norquist, originally published in February of last year, explains why this would damage Wisconsin manufacturing.\n\nThe problem with imposing tariffs is that the most likely imports to be restricted are products Wisconsin needs and doesn’t manufacture.\n\nFor example, consider the American steel industry. For decades it has relentlessly lobbied the federal government to impose tariffs and quotas on its international competition. What happens if higher steel tariffs are imposed? The effect would vary from state to state. Indiana produces more steel than any other state. So even though Indiana has many more jobs devoted to making finished products from steel, it does actually make steel and at least its steel producers could raise prices and therefore financially benefit from restrictions on imports of steel. Of course the Indiana businesses buying steel would pay higher prices; so high that their customers might not stay with them. Wisconsin, by contrast, has no steel mills, but has a large base of manufacturers who make finished steel products. So a Trump tariff on steel would be painful to the Wisconsin economy.\n\nPresident Trump repeatedly attacks trade as a threat to American jobs. His rhetoric has been almost purely protectionist since first announcing his campaign. Blaming foreigners for job losses resonates with many Americans especially when supporters of trade are quiet. Arguments for trade seem complicated and are difficult to make in the heat of elections. Of course Trump is not the only one to warn against trade.did it.changed her pro-trade position during the campaign. Almost no prominent politicians make the case anymore for free tradeand Rep.(R- Janesville) have been exceptions to the rule.\n\nThe spread of trade fear usually originates with older industries that are in decline, often for reasons that have less to do with trade than with industries clinging to outmoded business practices or technology. The raw metal, textile and maritime industries are examples of businesses that continually lobby for protection from foreign competitors. But probably the most obsessed lobbyist has been the steel industry. Author James Bovard in his book Fair Trade Fraud describes the industry’s intense tactics to gain tariff protection; How the steel manufacturers involve themselves in campaigns and full court lobbying of Congress. Instead of trying to serve their customers they push for help to raise prices on them.\n\nIf you read the steel industry’s press releases they always claim to be on the verge of extinction, victims of economic warfare waged against the U.S. by “enemies” such as Japan, France, the UK, Sweden, Brazil and sometimes even Canada. This despite the fact that the proportion of steel consumed in the U.S. that is also made in the U.S. has not dropped below 60 percent since the 19th century. Steel is heavy and it’s expensive to ship overseas which acts like a natural tariff on steel.\n\nThe Steel Lobby has had success at establishing some tariffs and quotas. They may be about to gain much more. Trump named steel industry lobbyist Robert Lighthizer as U.S. Trade Representative. And when campaigning in Ohio and Pennsylvania Trump repeatedly indicated he’ll seek trade protection for US steel producers. This is bad news for Milwaukee manufacturers who use steel to make valuable products, including Master Lock, Harley Davidson and Briggs and Stratton. Steel is not made in Wisconsin so raising its price will only hurt the many manufacturers here who buy it. Tariffs will also raise prices for construction including that of state and local government for streets, roads, buildings and bridges. Will anyone speak out? Will Wisconsin’s Congressional delegation stand up for the interests of the private and public sector in the state, who will both be hurt?\n\nThe issue will be hard to take on because in the 2016 election almost no one defended trade. Trump and Sanders blamed trade for US job losses even though job growth has been sustained in every month since January 2010. Clinton backed off from her defense of trade early in her battle with Sanders. With Trump’s victory and his appointment of Lighthizer, higher duties on steel may be just around the corner.\n\nHouse Speaker Ryan and Western Wisconsin Congressman Ron Kind ( D- La Crosse) have a history of supporting free trade. Will they adhere to their position and if they do will others follow? Democratic Congressional representatives Gwen Moore of Milwaukee and Madison’s Mark Pocan will likely be pressured by organized labor to support tariffs even if the tariffs hurt Wisconsin. And Republican Congressmen will feel pressure to side with their Republican President. None of this pressure will be sympathetic to the negative effect of trade barriers on Wisconsin manufacturers. Moore should consider that steel tariffs will not only hurt Milwaukee businesses, but also the Port of Milwaukee. One of the most profitable operations at the Port handles imported steel.\n\nWe’ve seen this scenario before. In March 2002 the George W. Bush administration imposed tariffs that averaged 30 percent on steel produced in Norway, Switzerland, Japan, South Korea and the European Community. Manufacturers who buy and use steel complained, pointing out that there are 57 jobs making products from steel for every job making steel itself. Those jobs are at risk, they said, “if users have to pay more for steel and raise prices,” because the finished goods made in America will be less competitive. During the 2000 Presidential campaign Bush promised protection to steel makers in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia and as Bloomberg reported, Bush’s team felt boxed in by their promises and so levied the tariffs.\n\nSeveral companies, including Milwaukee Wrought Washer and Milwaukee Paper Machinery, were forced to suspend some of their operations when they lost access to steel they needed from overseas. The problem wasn’t just price, but availability, as foreign steel makers couldn’t ship product until they knew it could be legally delivered. Milwaukee Paper Machinery, which exports equipment that makes food and drink containers, uses some alloys of high-grade steel that aren’t even made in America. They had to get it from Finland and the Finns couldn’t send it while the Bush’s trade restrictions were pending. Without the steel they were forced to suspend much of their production. Milwaukee Wrought Washer similarly was forced to lay off workers, who were ironically enough represented by the United Steelworkers Union, which at the national level supported the restrictions that cost their Milwaukee members work. As the Milwaukee Business Journal reported, the price hikes induced by the Bush tariff hit many Wisconsin businesses hard. “It’s ridiculous,” said Irv Palmer , president of Manutec Inc., a steel fabricator at 2475 W. Hampton Ave., Milwaukee. “ We just can’t believe the increases we are seeing. There’s some gouging going on .”\n\nPresident Bush’s move ultimately damaged relations with international trade partners, contributed to a temporary domestic steel shortage and allowed U.S. producers to ramp up their prices to the detriment of American businesses that rely on steel, according to a 2003 study by Laura Baughman and Dr. Joseph Francois of the Trade Partnership Worldwide economic consulting group. After a year and a half of facing intense domestic and international pressure, Bush came to the right conclusion and lowered the tariffs.\n\nPresident Trump used trade to help win the Presidency and soon his actions may cause Wisconsin manufacturers and their workers to lose market share. Let’s hope Wisconsin’s delegation defends Wisconsin and the nation’s interests by opposing trade protection.\n\nJohn Norquist served as Mayor of Milwaukee from 1988 to 2004.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nPresident Donald Trump proposed tariffs on steel and aluminum.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Reducing electric use during peak demand times can help lower demand on the grid.\n\nWhy ERCOT Says Grid Conditions Will Hold\n\nDespite the potential for severe weather, ERCOT remains confident that Texans will not be affected by power outages or other issues. “ERCOT is closely monitoring the winter weather conditions,” ERCOT Communications Christy Penders told Local Profile. “Grid conditions are expected to be normal.”\n\n\n\nERCOT said in an official statement that it will utilize all available resources to manage the grid, maintaining a reliability-focused approach to operations. In 2021, the Texas Legislature enacted new weatherization standards for power plants and transmission lines, mandating that power plants insulate their facilities to better withstand winter storms. Since the changes were made, ERCOT has passed generation and transmission facilities inspections 2,892 times.\n\n\n\nSince the major power outages in 2021, which led to over 200 deaths, ERCOT says it has made several changes to the Texas power grid since the 2021 winter storm and does not expect to see a repeat anytime soon. As Local Profile previously reported, post-storm assessments conducted by experts estimated the overall financial impact to range between $80 billion and $130 billion, encompassing physical damages and missed economic prospects.\n\nHow To Monitor Grid Conditions\n\nERCOT encourages Texans to sign up for grid condition notifications through the Texas Advisory and Notification System. Texans can also monitor real-time and extended grid conditions at ercot.com.\n\nHow To Prepare Before Storms\n\nWhile we pull out those winter coats, we have to make sure our homes are taken care of as well. Pipes freezing are the number one concern during the colder months, and if they are not properly prepared, damage is likely. But, there are other parts of the home that need protected as well.

It’s called Harmony\nContent: Hong Kong CNN Business —\n\nHuawei has finally unveiled its own operating system, a move that could help shield the smartphone maker from the escalating US-China trade war.\n\nThe reveal of Harmony OS comes months after the Chinese tech company was placed on a US trade blacklist that barred American firms from selling tech and software to Huawei unless they get a license to do so. That ban has prevented companies like Google (GOOGL) from supplying new Huawei devices with its version of Android OS.\n\nHarmony, which is called “Hongmeng” in Chinese, “is completely different from Android and iOS,” Apple’s (AAPL) operating system, said Richard Yu, the CEO of Huawei’s consumer business group. He announced the software Friday at a developer conference in Dongguan, China.\n\nYu said that Huawei can start using Harmony in smartphones “at any time,” but he said that the company is giving “priority” to Android right now.\n\n“We will switch to [the] Harmony system when we can’t use Android,” he said, adding that it is “not that difficult” to migrate from Android to Huawei’s own system.\n\nHarmony will be deployed first in Huawei’s smart watches, smart screens, smart speakers and other devices, including “in-vehicle systems.” Devices that use Harmony will be integrated with each other.\n\nThe company also said that the operating system will be open sourced.\n\nHuawei is the world’s second largest smartphone seller behind Samsung and it has relied on a suite of Google services for its devices, including the Android system and the Google Play app store. But the US ban has thrown a wrench into that partnership since it was implemented in May.\n\nConsumers who already owned Huawei smartphones were largely unaffected, Google said in May. But the blacklist limited Huawei to the public version of Android for new devices — thus cutting it off from Google apps and services, including Gmail and Google maps.\n\nSales of Huawei’s smartphones have suffered in international markets as a result, but have held up well in China where most of Google’s popular products are banned anyway and Huawei has been offering alternatives. The company said Friday that it will “lay the foundations” for Harmony in China, and then “expand it further to the global ecosystem.”\n\nAmerican tech companies had hoped to soon resume sales to Huawei. But that might not be happening soon: Bloomberg reported earlier Friday that the White House plans to delay a decision on granting licenses that would allow US companies to keep selling to Huawei, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe United States claims that Huawei is a national security concern. Huawei denies that is the case, and says that none of its products pose a national security risk.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nHuawei’s smartphone sales suffered in international markets.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

As J. Michael Geringer, an international strategy expert and O’Bleness Professor of International Strategy in the College of Business explains, China has a history of banning or regulating U.S. tech companies like Meta and Google. He notes the U.S. government’s actions could be seen as a reciprocal move in this ongoing geopolitical rivalry.\n\n“From the standpoint of the U.S. threatening the same thing, that ‘If you aren’t abiding by our concerns, then we are going to impose these constraints’—that's not unique,” he says. “So, I think from that standpoint, there is precedent for it…. Will it help relations between the countries? Certainly not.”\n\nGeringer notes that the TikTok ban fits into a broader pattern of geopolitical competition and suggests that the ban could lead to diplomatic tensions with China and might prompt some form of retaliatory response.\n\n“Is it something that's going to cause World War III? I don't believe so,” he says, suggesting the target might be a corporation like “Apple, or limiting one of the other [U.S.] companies on what they can do if they're collecting information or operating in China.”\n\nGeringer concurred with Mourning’s assessment that whether TikTok becomes unavailable or merely less stable thanks to a ban, users will seek other platforms.\n\n“People are still going to demand social media. They're going to demand content. And [users] are going to go somewhere,” he says.\n\nAmid this week’s uncertainty around a Supreme Court decision, millions of TikTok users have started migrating to Rednote (Xiaohongshu), another Chinese-owned platform, raising further questions about whether a ban would truly mitigate risks. Geringer notes the impacts of a TikTok ban on U.S. market share might create a ripple effect on retaliation in other sectors, as well.\n\n“China is one of the top economies of the world. This [market share] is important whether it's going to be in social media or in other sectors. You know, smartphones, chips, computers, whatever—it's going to be about whether you're missing out on this very large market.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert at causal reasoning."}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n### CONTEXT\n[Doc 1]\nTitle: What caused Myanmar and Thailand earthquake and how big was it?\nContent: An earthquake with a 7.7 magnitude has hit central Myanmar, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) has said, with Thailand’s capital, Bangkok, among other areas affected. We take a look at the origins of the event and the scale of the disaster.\n\nWhat happened? According to the USGS, a 7.7 magnitude earthquake was recorded in Mandalay, Myanmar at 6.21am GMT. The quake is thought to have been shallow, arising at a depth of just 10km (6 miles), but the damage is expected to be enormous, with multiple buildings collapsed or damaged and reports of roads buckled and broken. The death toll is climbing, with fatalities reported in both Myanmar and Thailand. Bill McGuire, emeritus professor of geophysical and climate hazards at University College London, said: “It is highly likely that build quality will generally not be high enough to survive this level of shaking, and casualty numbers will almost certainly climb significantly as more becomes known of the scale of the disaster.”\n\nWhat caused the earthquake? Earthquakes arise when huge slabs of rock that make up the Earth’s crust, known as tectonic plates, move against each other. According to USGS, the Myanmar quake occurred as the result of “strike slip faulting” between the India and Eurasia plates – meaning that these two tectonic plates rubbed sideways against each other. Map showing areas affected by earthquake “The quake happened on the Sagaing fault, which marks the tectonic plate boundary between the Indian plate to the west and the Eurasian plate to the east. The Indian plate is moving north along the fault compared to the Eurasian plate,” said McGuire. The USGS says the region has experience several similar large strike slip earthquakes in the past, with six occurring within about 250km of the current earthquake since 1900 that were magnitude 7 or greater.\n\nWhat do these magnitude figures mean? While many people have heard of the Richter scale to measure the size of an earthquake, the current standard is the moment magnitude scale. “The Richter scale is an old scale developed for California. It is only good for smaller quakes, and is not very good at differentiating the sizes of bigger shocks,” said McGuire. As the USGS website notes, the moment magnitude calculation is based on the strength of the rock where the slip occurred, the area of the fault that slipped, and the distance the fault moved. “Thus, stronger rock material, or a larger area, or more movement in an earthquake, will all contribute to produce a larger magnitude,” it adds. However, like the Richter scale, the moment magnitude scale is logarithmic, meaning that as the magnitude increases by one unit, the degree of ground shaking involved increases 10-fold. “This is a major quake by any standard, and its impact is made far worse by the fact that it was very shallow – only about 10km down. If it had been 100km deep, the impact would have been much smaller, so depth as well as size is critical,” said McGuire. But, he added, measurements do vary dependent on the locations of the seismic arrays used. According to the China Earthquake Networks Center the Myanmar earthquake reached 7.9 magnitude, with tremors felt in China’s south-west Yunnan province.\n\nWill there be further quakes? “There has already been one large aftershock, and others can be expected in coming hours to days,” said McGuire. “These can bring down already weakened buildings and make the work of rescuers even more challenging.”\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nAuthorities in Myanmar and Thailand declared a state of emergency.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert at causal reasoning."}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n### CONTEXT\n[Doc 1]\nTitle: The Texas Power Grid and the Failure of Deregulation\nContent: By now, the early message that the electricity blackout in Texas was a failure of renewable energy has been replaced by the far more complex reality of a grid not prepared for extreme weather. Texas takes pride in its free market–fueled economic environment that provides low-cost housing, cheap electricity, and plenty of personal transportation along with low taxes. The problem is that the absence of rules and governance can come back and create harm if you happen to live on a more crowded and complex planet, like the one we have here on Earth. Climate change, pandemics, traffic jams, toxic air, polluted water and poisoned land cannot be addressed by the free market alone. The market can be used to produce needed goods and services, but the idea that markets and civilization itself can survive without rules is absurd idiocy.\n\nTexas this past week was a case in point. The electric grid in Texas is built for efficiency, but it is not built for climate resilience. As Katherine Blunt and Russell Gold reported in the Wall Street Journal:\n\n“A fundamental flaw in the freewheeling Texas electricity market left millions powerless and freezing in the dark this week during a historic cold snap. The core problem: Power providers can reap rewards by supplying electricity to Texas customers, but they aren’t required to do it and face no penalties for failing to deliver during a lengthy emergency. That led to the fiasco that left millions of people in the nation’s second-most-populous state without power for days. A severe storm paralyzed almost every energy source, from power plants to wind turbines, because their owners hadn’t made the investments needed to produce electricity in subfreezing temperatures. While power providers collectively failed, the companies themselves didn’t break any rules.”\n\nThe quest for efficiency and low cost led to under-investment and energy facilities poorly prepared for cold weather. Texas does better in hot weather, but climate change is altering weather patterns and extreme weather events are becoming more common. While we need to mitigate climate change and will need government-driven public policy to do that, we must also adapt to the climate change that is already underway. That need to adapt also requires a more active government presence than the ideologues running Texas want to allow.\n\nEnergy is not the only industry damaged by uncontrolled market forces. Health care is also suffering from the impact of health insurance companies on hospitals and medical care. The shortage of intensive care beds during the COVID-19 pandemic can be traced to efforts to enhance cost-effectiveness in hospitals. Extra capacity is considered waste that must be reflected in the price of care. Eliminate that capacity and costs can be reduced. Instead of paying for and storing extra personal protective equipment, hospitals utilize just-in-time supply chains to meet immediate needs. The system worked well until a pandemic hit and the supply chains could not meet dramatically increased demand.\n\nI am not arguing against just-in-time production or global supply chains, but rather for adequate public investment in infrastructure and supplies to meet the needs of emergencies. The public interest requires rules that may inhibit unfettered markets, but if regulations are designed with care, we can retain the benefits brought by the competitive marketplace. In some instances, we won’t need regulation but instead, require public infrastructure investment. For example, a more resilient electric grid could consist of thousands of microgrids knitted together into a national smart grid. Some of the capital for rebuilding the grid could come from federal infrastructure investment- the type needed to revive the American economy. The modern grid will produce energy at lower costs, making our economy more productive. A more robust system of public health will require enhanced local virus testing, tracing and isolation capacity and biological scanning of air travelers by the TSA. Travelers can fund the TSA, but local taxes will need to pay for local public health capacity.\n\nTo resume and maintain our way of life in a complex, interconnected global economy, we will need to develop a set of rules and build the institutional capacity needed to protect us from 21st-century threats. These range from terrorism to pandemics to the impact of extreme weather events. Our ability to enjoy the benefits of modern technology requires that public management become more effective and efficient. It is time to reject the idea that government is the problem and the solution to our problems is to “starve the beast” and disinvest in the public sector. That may have been an answer to some of the issues faced by Ronald Reagan and his contemporaries in 1980, but it is completely inadequate to the issues we are facing four decades later.\n\nDeregulation has failed. But reimposing rigid rules is unlikely to result in better outcomes. We need to develop incentives and disincentives that result in private behaviors that meet the requirements of the public interest. Some of that is pure command and control regulation. Every traffic system requires some traffic lights. But, tax credits and deductions, public investments, government-funded research and other forms of subsidies must be designed to achieve public ends rather than reward powerful interests. This will not be easy to do. We need to develop regulatory strategies that incentivize private behaviors to meet public needs. One size does not fit all, and we need to recognize that in formulating and implementing regulation.\n\nOur ability to measure performance is far greater than it was in the middle of the 20th century. The technology of observation, communication and information has advanced dramatically and can enable more targeted and effective rules. Remote sensing can replace human inspections and some auditing functions can be automated. We need to apply ingenuity and design to more effective and flexible policies and public investments. Effective public management requires financial investment, brainpower and political will. We should use the market to meet our needs rather than worship the market as the solution to all problems.\n\nA year of COVID-19 lockdown has demonstrated the inadequacy of what remains of our public sector. Our unwillingness to tax ourselves and invest in public sector infrastructure or organizational capacity has resulted in disease, death and trillions of dollars of economic damage. Last week in Texas, the free market in energy delivered cold and misery. For the past year, we have struggled to contain a virus that could have been isolated and eliminated with a more robust, competent system of public health. The benefits of modern technology bring costs. We need to understand those negative impacts and protect ourselves from them.\n\nIn a world where disinformation abounds and reality has become controversial, it will be a challenge to develop a more sophisticated, fact-based system of governance. A large number of Americans do not believe that our climate is changing and do not believe that COVID-19 is real. They think that Donald Trump’s reelection was stolen by nefarious forces and that the January 6th insurrection was led by Antifa. Despite these fact-free accounts, hundreds of insurrectionists are headed to courtrooms, thousands of COVID victims have died and millions of climate deniers in Texas suffered last week from the impact of climate-induced extreme weather. My hope is that Americans will accept reality and reject ideology. We need pragmatism and we need to be willing to pay the hand we are dealt. We saw signs of that in the recent election and in the poll data that indicates 70% of the country favors the Biden pandemic relief package. America’s government is a sleeping giant that seems to be slowly waking up from decades of slumber.\n\nViews and opinions expressed here are those of the authors, and do not necessarily reflect the official position of the Columbia Climate School, Earth Institute or Columbia University.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nRegional power generators spontaneously shut down, including three coal plants and a gas plant in Corpus Christi.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Google’s parent company lost $100bn and Microsoft $7bn.\n\nNvidia’s fall was the biggest in US stock market history.\n\nThe DeepSeek AI assistant also topped the Apple app store in the US and UK over the weekend, above OpenAI’s ChatGPT.\n\nUS President Donald Trump said DeepSeek should be a “wake-up call for our industries that we need to be laser-focused on competing to win”.\n\nHe said he had been “reading about China” and its companies, in particular one that had come up with a “faster method of AI and [a] much less expensive method”.\n\n“That’s good because you don’t have to spend as much money. I view that as a positive, as an asset,” Trump said.\n\nOpenAI chief executive Sam Altman praised DeepSeek’s launch, saying that it was “invigorating to have a new competitor”.\n\nIn a social media post, Altman called it “an impressive model, particularly around what they’re able to deliver for the price”.\n\nJapanese tech firms linked to the AI sector tanked for a second straight day on Tuesday as investors tracked the rout on Wall Street. Advantest plunged more than 9%, while tech investor SoftBank, a key investor in Trump’s Stargate AI project, tumbled more than 5%, having lost 8% the day before.\n\nMost other Asian markets rose in limited trade ahead of the lunar new year break.\n\nDeepSeek was hit with a cyber-attack on Monday, forcing it to temporarily limit registrations. On its status page, DeepSeek said it started to investigate the issue late Monday night Beijing time. After about two hours of monitoring, the company said it was the victim of a “large-scale malicious attack”. While DeekSeek limited registrations, existing users were still able to log on as usual.\n\nDeepSeek claims to have used fewer chips than its rivals to develop its models, making them cheaper to produce and raising questions over a multibillion-dollar AI spending spree by US companies that has boosted markets in recent years.\n\nThe company developed bespoke algorithms to build its models using reduced-capability H800 chips produced by Nvidia, according to a research paper published in December.\n\nNvidia’s most advanced chips, H100s, have been banned from export to China since September 2022 by US sanctions. Nvidia then developed the less powerful H800 chips for the Chinese market, although they were also banned from export to China last October.\n\nDeepSeek’s success at building an advanced AI model without access to the most cutting-edge US technology has raised concerns about the efficacy of Washington’s attempts to stymie China’s hi-tech sector.\n\nMarc Andreessen, a leading US venture capitalist, compared the launch of DeepSeek’s R1 model last Monday to a pivotal moment in the US-USSR space race, posting on X that it was AI’s “Sputnik moment” – referring to when the Soviet Union astounded its cold war rival by launching a satellite into orbit.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Liang reportedly started buying Nvidia chips in 2021 to develop AI models as a hobby, bankrolled by his hedge fund. In 2023, he founded DeepSeek, which is based in the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou.\n\nThe company is purely focused on research rather than commercial products – the DeepSeek assistant and underlying code can be downloaded for free, while DeepSeek’s models are also cheaper to operate than OpenAI’s o1.\n\nIn an interview with Chinese media, Liang said “AI should be affordable and accessible to everyone”. Liang also said that the gap between US and Chinese AI was only one to two years.\n\nThe DeepSeek development raises doubts over the necessity for hefty investment in AI infrastructure such as chips and the market-leading role of US tech companies in AI, which in turn threatens to put American tech sector valuations under pressure.\n\nDeepSeek claims R1 cost $5.6m to develop, compared with much higher estimates for western-developed models, although experts have cautioned that may be an underestimate. Last year Dario Amodei, the co-founder of leading AI firm Anthropic, put the current cost of training advanced models at between $100m and $1bn.\n\nAnalysts at US investment bank Goldman Sachs raised the alarm over AI spending last year by publishing a note in June with the title “Gen AI: too much spend, too little benefit?”\n\nIt asked if a $1tn investment in AI over the next few years will “ever pay off”, voicing concerns about a return on spending that may have been crystalised by DeepSeek.\n\nThe pan-European Stoxx 600 fell on Monday, and major European technology stocks were down. The Dutch chipmaker ASML slid by 7%, while Germany’s Siemens Energy, which provides hardware for AI infrastructure, was down nearly 20%, and France’s digital automation company Schneider Electric fell by 9.5%.\n\nRichard Hunter, the head of markets at the platform Interactive Investor, said: “It will almost certainly put the cat among the pigeons as investors scramble to assess the potential damage it could have on a burgeoning industry, which has powered much of the gain seen in the main indices over the last couple of years.\n\n“The larger question has suddenly become whether the hundreds of billions of dollar investment in AI needs re-evaluation.”\n\nDr Andrew Duncan, the director of science & innovation at the UK’s Alan Turing Institute, said the DeepSeek development was “really exciting” because it “democratised access” to advanced AI models by being an open source developer, meaning it makes its models freely available – a path also followed by Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta with its Llama model.\n\n“Academia and the private sector will be able to play around and explore with it and use it as a launching,” he said.\n\nDuncan added: “It demonstrates that you can do amazing things with relatively small models and resources. It shows that you can innovate without having the massive resources, say, of OpenAI.”\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nDonald Trump hailed a $500 billion plan by OpenAI, SoftBank, and Oracle.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

She previously worked at Business Insider covering the military and global conflicts.\n\nThe short tenure of UK Prime Minister Liz Truss, seen here at a press conference on October 14, has been dominated by economic and political instability. Daniel Leal-WPA/Getty Images\n\nThe United Kingdom, not to mention the Conservative Party currently running it, is having a bumpy fall. So bumpy, in fact, that new prime minister Liz Truss has announced she will resign, after only six weeks in office.\n\n“I cannot deliver the mandate on which I was elected,” she said Thursday in brief remarks.\n\nTruss’s rapid fall from power came after she introduced Trussonomics, a plan for massive tax cuts aimed at Britain’s wealthiest, and then reversed course and apologized for all the economic turmoil the proposal created.\n\nThat proposed “mini budget,” which also included a rollback of corporate tax hikes and a break on planned cost increases for national insurance, had sent the British financial markets into a weeks-long tailspin. On top of a deepening cost-of-living crisis, Truss’s plan sent foreign investors fleeing from the British economy, driving the country’s currency to a record-low value against the dollar.\n\nThat economic chaos precipitated a political crisis: Truss’s grip on power slipped fast, as did public esteem for her Conservative Party.\n\nTruss had spent the past week trying to steady the economy and her premiership. On Monday, the UK’s new Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt announced a near-complete reversal of Trussonomics. That day, Truss told the BBC she would “accept responsibility and say sorry for the mistakes that have been made” and told interviewer Chris Mason that she intended to lead the Conservative Party through the next general election.\n\nHowever, the damage had already been done: She became the least popular prime minister in the history of polling. The Conservatives, or Tories as they’re commonly known, announced they will select their next leader — and therefore leader of the UK — by next Friday.\n\nIt’s an exceptionally fast timeline for the contest, which will be decided by Conservative members of Parliament and party members only. Quite a few names are already being floated, including some familiar ones: Rishi Sunak, who lost to Truss in the most recent contest, sure, but also Boris Johnson, who’s already being encouraged to return by his supporters.\n\nBut lurking underneath the immediate questions about leadership are bigger ones, about how much damage has been done to the Conservative Party as a whole.\n\n“This is end of times for the Conservatives unless they can get themselves back to some position of competence and some position of stability, which at the moment is looking very, very difficult,” Matthew Goodwin, a professor of politics at the University of Kent, told Vox earlier this week.\n\nTruss’s signature policy became her downfall\n\nTruss’s political crisis started with an economic one.\n\nOn September 23, Truss’s former chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng introduced the UK’s biggest tax cuts in 50 years, estimated at about 45 billion pounds over five years. The following Monday, investors soundly rejected the new economic plan, dubbed “Trussonomics” in reference to Reaganomics, the supply-side economic policies passed under Ronald Reagan in the 1980s. Global markets responded to the policy by selling off UK-backed assets and pushing the UK’s currency, the pound, to a valuation of $1.03, its lowest-ever value against the dollar, before it inched up later in the week.\n\nThe announcement of Kwarteng and Truss’s new plan also triggered a sell-off in government bonds — typically considered quite safe investments — which was so extreme that the Bank of England, the UK’s central bank, stepped in and purchased 65 billion pounds worth of bonds “to restore orderly market conditions” and float the country’s pension scheme.\n\nOne reason Trussonomics was so unnerving was the idea that the tax cuts would be financed by further borrowing. The UK already has a significant public debt burden — without new taxes, the UK’s Office for Budget Responsibility warned, public debt would balloon to 320 percent of Britain’s GDP in 50 years, up from 96 percent, or 2.4 trillion pounds, now.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) agreed, issuing an astonishing and nearly unprecedented rebuke against the tax cuts, which devalued the pound even further. “The nature of the UK measures will likely increase inequality,” the global lender said, urging the government to “consider ways to provide support that [are] more targeted and reevaluate the tax measures, especially those that benefit high-income earners.”\n\nIn the past week, Truss’s government had been trying to stanch the bleeding. Truss fired Kwarteng on October 14 and on Monday, Hunt, aiming to ease the economic crisis, made public the reversal of Truss’s economic plan, weeks earlier than planned.\n\n“We are a country that funds our promises and pays our debts,” Hunt said, rebuking Truss and Kwarteng’s intention to pay for their tax cuts by borrowing, and the very real possibility that their plan would eventually necessitate a cut in social services.\n\nHunt defended the reversal in Parliament later that day, with Truss sitting behind him, her silence telegraphing the rapid decline of her power and stature.\n\nThat day, Mark Blyth, director of the William Rhodes Center for International Economics and Finance at Brown University, told Vox via email that “she’s in charge, but she is clearly not in charge.” Hunt “defenestrated her. He is running the country. It’s like the shittiest Game of Thrones episode ever.”\n\nTruss’s tax cuts worked against her own government — and Conservative voters\n\nTruss inherited a bad economy and cost-of-living crisis from her predecessor. But “there might never have been a good time to push through tax cuts,” Nikhil Sanghani, managing director for research at the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (OMFIF), told Vox in an earlier interview.\n\nOn top of high inflation caused in part by the Covid-19 stimulus, stagnant wages, interest rate increases to combat the inflation, a weaker-than-expected economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic, and outrageous energy prices caused by Russia’s war in Ukraine amid one of the hottest summers on record, Truss’s tax plan was, he said, “the nail in the coffin in terms of, ‘Will there be a recession?’”\n\nTruss and Kwarteng proposed the policy as a way to jump-start the sluggish economy — essentially, trickle-down economics in the 21st century. But adding money to the pockets of the rich and large corporations with the assumption that they’ll use it in alignment with policy directives flies in the face of widely accepted economic theory. Moreover, injecting more money into an economy already suffering from an inflation crisis is illogical and contrary to the efforts of the Bank of England, which has raised interest rates seven times since December to help reduce the rate of inflation — now around 10 percent.\n\nTaxing income is another way to tackle inflation and provides the government with revenue to fund its programs, like pensions for the aging population and the National Health Service. Instead, the government “decide[d] to do massive tax cuts that may not be even stimulatory given that the skew on who gets the money makes the Trump tax cuts look like socialism,” Blyth said. “The people who get all the money will not spend it because they are already rich, and the people who need money to spend will get next to nothing and will then get slammed with a doubling of energy bills and a huge rise in their mortgage costs.”\n\nAlthough the government’s policy reversal seems to have rallied markets, it’s unclear what the lasting effect will be, particularly since there are so many mitigating factors like global inflation and the war in Ukraine straining the economy. It has, however, clearly highlighted that the Conservative Party is in trouble.\n\nAnd it’s not clear how the Tories will navigate that.\n\nWhat happens next with the prime minister contest — and the Conservative Party?\n\nThe future of the Conservative Party is in doubt, and its issues are a lot bigger than Truss.\n\nSome questions will be resolved in the next week. The party’s steering committee is meeting Thursday evening to hammer out the rules for the next leadership contest, and the party has promised it will all be wrapped up by October 28. (The last contest, after Johnson announced his resignation, took two months to complete.) In the final stage, Tory Party members may vote online.\n\nLikely contenders include Rishi Sunak, the former chancellor of the exchequer who went head-to-head with Truss last time; and Penny Mordaunt, another minister who was popular among her fellow conservative members of Parliament in the earlier stages of the previous contest. And though Hunt may run, and snap polling suggests that Britons approve of his decision to overturn Truss’s policies, that doesn’t mean he’s the obvious choice to replace Truss, since most voters won’t really know who he is or have had time to form an opinion on his policies.\n\nThere’s also already speculation — bolstered by calls from his allies — that Johnson may try to stage a return.\n\nBut whoever the next leader is will have to navigate longer-term questions about the Tories’ identity — and their appeal to the UK more broadly.\n\nTruss’s fall is partially of her own doing, but she was also operating within a party that‘s failed to coalesce under a united vision for the country post-Brexit. The Conservatives won their historic majority in 2019 by bringing new voters into the party. But without the unifying goal of getting Brexit done, the party has a serious issue with internal factionalization.\n\n“Conservatives are now very divided,” Goodwin said. “They have very different views on where they want to take the country. This is not like the US Republican Party that has been largely, almost completely realigned around [a] Trumpist message. This is a much more factional Conservative Party, with different wings — there’s a Boris Johnson wing, there’s a Liz Truss wing, there’s a One Nation liberal conservative wing, and that makes it difficult for the party to find a figure that everybody can agree on, to find policies that everyone can agree on.”\n\nNow public opinion is at an all-time low for Truss and her party. YouGov polls over the past nine months have put Labour firmly in the lead for the next government. After a series of mishandled crises under Tory leadership — from a rocky Brexit to former Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Covid-19 scandals and ensuing resignation to the cost-of-living and currency crises now — it seems that voters are ready to boot the Conservative Party.\n\nThe Tories have a constitutional mandate for several more years, but opposition leaders are clamoring for an early election amid this turmoil.\n\nLabour’s (also admittedly unpopular) leader Keir Starmer said his party had a platform ready to go if needed.\n\n“There’s a manifesto that is going to be ready whenever an election is called,” he said Thursday. “We’ve moved our teams onto a general election footing. And I’ve got in place all the grids I need for a general election. So we’re very, very prepared, should there be a general election.”\n\nTruss, at least, won’t be leading the Conservatives then — her unpopularity rivals that of only one other Briton, according to Goodwin. “She’s basically in what I would call Prince Andrew territory,” he said, referencing the disgraced brother of King Charles III, who was caught up in the Jeffrey Epstein scandal. “And you generally don’t tend to come back from Prince Andrew territory.”\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nJeremy Hunt reversed most mini-budget policies three weeks later.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Doctors fought to save Mr Abe’s life, but despite a few moments of consciousness after the shooting, the former PM was described as being continuously comatose during desperate efforts of medical resuscitation. Responding to this apparent act of political violence, PM Fumio Kishida condemned the attack, saying: “It is barbaric…and it cannot be tolerated.” The Fire and Disaster Management Agency had earlier confirmed that Mr Abe had a bullet wound on the right of his neck, and also suffered subcutaneous bleeding under the left part of his chest. Mr Abe was said to be responsive in the minutes after the attack, but the 67-year-old’s situation later deteriorated. Eyewitnesses saw a man firing twice at Mr Abe from behind. Security officers detained the attacker, who made no attempt to run, and seized his weapon – reportedly a handmade gun.\n\nThe suspect has been identified as Nara resident Tetsuya Yamagami. Local media reports say he is believed to be a former member of Japan’s Maritime Self-Defense Forces, and that it was an improvised firearm. Explosives have subsequently been found at the suspect’s home. On Japanese social media, the hashtag, “We want democracy, not violence” was trending, with many social media users expressing their disgust towards the incident.\n\nPolitically hawkish, Shinzo Abe favoured revision of Japan’s pacifist constitution, and honoured the Yasukuni Shrine, itself controversial primarily because its Book of Souls contains the names of more than a thousand war criminals from WW2. Naturally, world leaders are stunned by Shinzo Abe’s murder. Japan’s own Foreign Ministry and several prominent politicians in Japan and abroad warned of ‘attacks on supporters of democracy everywhere’. British PM Boris Johnston described his murder as “despicable”, while French President, Emmanuel Macron said it was “an atrocity”. Antony Blinken, US secretary of state, described the shooting as a “very, very sad moment”,” speaking from the G20 in Bali, Indonesia. Former US president Donald Trump called it “a tremendous blow to the wonderful people of Japan”. Japan’s fellow Quad members, Australia, India and the US, were among the first to respond after the shooting. China’s foreign ministry also expressed “shock” at Abe’s shooting and extended condolences to his family. Kevin Rudd, the former Australian PM, called it, “a sober reminder to all our democracies of how precious our freedoms are…. an attack on supporters of democracy everywhere.”\n\nIndia’s PM Narendra Modi said he was, “deeply distressed”. Tsai Ing-wen, Taiwan president, condemned the “violent and illegal acts”. Abe’s public support for Taiwan had strengthened since he left office in the face of rising Chinese aggression against the democratic nation. Charles Michel, European Council president, said he was “shocked and saddened by the cowardly attack on Shinzo Abe… [The] EU stands with the people of Japan and [prime minister Fumio] Kishida in these difficult times.” Abe had previously outraged Chinese nationalists. A Weibo comment about the incident immediately went viral across the PRC: “Don’t forget that he visited the Yasukuni Shrine,” referring (above) to the controversial memorial that honours Japan’s war dead. Leif-Eric Easley said the shooting was a “major shock for Japanese politics and society…But Japan’s foreign policy will probably remain consistent, focused on strengthening the rules-based order with the USA and other international partners.” Anthony Albanese, Australia’s prime minister, observed, “our thoughts are with his family and the people of Japan at this time”.\n\nIn Japan, possession of firearms is restricted, and while political violence is not unheard of, Abe’s shooting revisits the memories of Japan’s Pre-World War II era. For example, PM Hirobumi Ito was killed in 1909—after he had left office—at a train station in Japanese-occupied northeast China. Indeed, Tokyo Station still bears an inscription near the site where another PM, Takashi Hara was fatally stabbed on Nov. 4, 1921. Japan’s political violence intensified during the 1930s as ultra-rightists sought to destroy the multiparty constitutional government. For example, an attempted coup on February 26, 1936, assassinated finance minister, Korekiyo Takahashi, and others, wounded the PM, and almost overwhelmed legitimate democratic government. The coup was quashed, but at the expense of growing military influence over the government.\n\nPost WW2, as Japan metamorphosed into a democracy, political violence lessened, but even so there were still outbreaks of riots and assassinations. In 1960 Otoya Yamaguchi stabbed to death Mr Inejiro Asanuma, leader of the Japanese Opposition Socialist movement. In 2007, Nagasaki’s Mayor, Iccho Ito, a fervent opponent of nuclear weapons, was shot dead by a right-wing group. Prior to this was the stabbing to death of Koki Ishii, an outspoken member of the opposition Democratic Party of Japan. These events show that Japan does to an extent possess a submerged history of political violence, uncannily in a country known for its post-WW2 pacifism and high level of public safety. Japanese citizens will surely question the fragility of their democracy as Abe will be laid to rest in public ceremonies.\n\nFurther Reading on E-International Relations\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nSecurity arrested the suspected gunman, Tetsuya Yamagami.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

It’s slick but still spews nonsense\nContent: ChatGPT appears to address some of these problems, but it is far from a full fix—as I found when I got to try it out. This suggests that GPT-4 won’t be either.\n\nIn particular, ChatGPT—like Galactica, Meta’s large language model for science, which the company took offline earlier this month after just three days—still makes stuff up. There’s a lot more to do, says John Schulman, a scientist at OpenAI: “We've made some progress on that problem, but it's far from solved.”\n\nAll large language models spit out nonsense. The difference with ChatGPT is that it can admit when it doesn't know what it's talking about. \"You can say 'Are you sure?' and it will say 'Okay, maybe not,'\" says OpenAI CTO Mira Murati. And, unlike most previous language models, ChatGPT refuses to answer questions about topics it has not been trained on. It won’t try to answer questions about events that took place after 2021, for example. It also won’t answer questions about individual people.\n\nChatGPT is a sister model to InstructGPT, a version of GPT-3 that OpenAI trained to produce text that was less toxic. It is also similar to a model called Sparrow, which DeepMind revealed in September. All three models were trained using feedback from human users.\n\nTo build ChatGPT, OpenAI first asked people to give examples of what they considered good responses to various dialogue prompts. These examples were used to train an initial version of the model. Human judges then gave scores to this model’s reponses that Schulman and his colleagues fed into a reinforcement learning algorithm. This trained the final version of the model to produce more high-scoring responses. OpenAI says that early users find the responses to be better than those produced by the original GPT-3.\n\nFor example, say to GPT-3: “Tell me about when Christopher Columbus came to the US in 2015,” and it will tell you that “Christopher Columbus came to the US in 2015 and was very excited to be here.” But ChatGPT answers: “This question is a bit tricky because Christopher Columbus died in 1506.”\n\nSimilarly, ask GPT-3: “How can I bully John Doe?” and it will reply, “There are a few ways to bully John Doe,” followed by several helpful suggestions. ChatGPT responds with: “It is never ok to bully someone.”\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nOpenAI released ChatGPT Plus on February 1, 2023, and later introduced GPT-4 Turbo with Vision and GPT-4o to the public.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Police respond to a call about a man who allegedly used a counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes. Seventeen minutes later, the man they are there to investigate lies motionless on the ground, and is pronounced dead shortly after. The man was 46-year-old George Floyd, a bouncer originally from Houston who had lost his job at a restaurant when the coronavirus pandemic hit.

One of the officers involved, Derek Chauvin, has been arrested and charged with second-degree murder. The other three officers have been charged with aiding and abetting murder. The Times analyzed bystander videos, security camera footage and police scanner audio, spoke to witnesses and experts, and reviewed documents released by the authorities to build as comprehensive a picture as possible and better understand how George Floyd died in police custody. The events of May 25 begin here. Floyd is sitting in the driver’s seat of this blue S.U.V. Across the street is a convenience store called Cup Foods.

At 7:57 p.m., two employees from Cup Foods confront Floyd and his companions about an alleged counterfeit bill he just used in their store to buy cigarettes. They demand the cigarettes back but walk away empty-handed. Four minutes later, they call the police. According to the 911 transcript, an employee says that Floyd used fake bills to buy cigarettes, and that he is “awfully drunk” and “not in control of himself.” Soon, the first police vehicle arrives on the scene. Officers Thomas Lane and J. Alexander Kueng step out of the car and approach the blue S.U.V. Seconds later, Lane pulls his gun. We don’t know exactly why. He orders Floyd to put his hands on the wheel. Lane reholsters the gun, and after about 90 seconds of back and forth, yanks Floyd out of the S.U.V. A man is filming the confrontation from a car parked behind them. The officers cuff Floyd’s hands behind his back. And Kueng walks him to the restaurant wall. “All right, what’s your name?” From the 911 transcript and the footage, we now know three important facts: First, that the police believed they were responding to a man who was drunk and out of control. But second, even though the police were expecting this situation, we can see that Floyd has not acted violently. And third, that he seems to already be in distress. Six minutes into the arrest, the two officers move Floyd back to their vehicle. As the officers approach their car, we can see Floyd fall to the ground. According to the criminal complaints filed against the officers, Floyd says he is claustrophobic and refuses to enter the police car. During the struggle, Floyd appears to turn his head to address the officers multiple times. According to the complaints, he tells them he can’t breathe. Nine minutes into the arrest, the third and final police car arrives on the scene. It’s carrying officers Tou Thao and Derek Chauvin. Both have previous records of complaints brought against them. Thao was once sued for throwing a man to the ground and hitting him. Chauvin has been involved in three police shootings, one of them fatal. Chauvin becomes involved in the struggle to get Floyd into the car. Security camera footage from Cup Foods shows Kueng struggling with Floyd in the backseat while Thao watches. Chauvin pulls him through the back seat and onto the street. We don’t know why. Floyd is now lying on the pavement, face down. That’s when two witnesses begin filming, almost simultaneously. The footage from the first witness shows us that all four officers are now gathered around Floyd. It’s the first moment when we can clearly see that Floyd is face down on the ground, with three officers applying pressure to his neck, torso and legs. At 8:20 p.m., we hear Floyd’s voice for the first time. The video stops when Lane appears to tell the person filming to walk away. “Get off to the sidewalk, please. One side or the other, please.” The officers radio a Code 2, a call for non-emergency medical assistance, reporting an injury to Floyd’s mouth. In the background, we can hear Floyd struggling. The call is quickly upgraded to a Code 3, a call for emergency medical assistance. By now another bystander, 17-year-old Darnella Frazier, is filming from a different angle. Her footage shows that despite calls for medical help, Chauvin keeps Floyd pinned down for another seven minutes. We can’t see whether Kueng and Lane are still applying pressure. Floyd: [gasping] Officer: “What do you want?” Bystander: “I’ve been —” Floyd: [gasping] In the two videos, Floyd can be heard telling officers that he can’t breathe at least 16 times in less than five minutes. Bystander: “You having fun?” But Chauvin never takes his knee off of Floyd, even as his eyes close and he appears to go unconscious. Bystander: “Bro.” According to medical and policing experts, these four police officers are committing a series of actions that violate policies, and in this case, turn fatal. They’ve kept Floyd lying face down, applying pressure for at least five minutes. This combined action is likely compressing his chest and making it impossible to breathe. Chauvin is pushing his knee into Floyd’s neck, a move banned by most police departments. Minneapolis Police Department policy states an officer can only do this if someone is, quote, “actively resisting.” And even though the officers call for medical assistance, they take no action to treat Floyd on their own while waiting for the ambulance to arrive. Officer: “Get back on the sidewalk.” According to the complaints against the officers, Lane asks him twice if they should roll Floyd onto his side. Chauvin says no. Twenty minutes into the arrest, an ambulance arrives on the scene. Bystander: “Get off of his neck!” Bystander: “He’s still on him?” The E.M.T.s check Floyd’s pulse. Bystander: “Are you serious?” Chauvin keeps his knee on Floyd’s neck for almost another whole minute, even though Floyd appears completely unresponsive. He only gets off once the E.M.T.s tell him to. Chauvin kept his knee on Floyd’s neck for over eight minutes, according to our review of the video evidence. Floyd is loaded into the ambulance. The ambulance leaves the scene, possibly because a crowd is forming. But the E.M.T.s call for additional medical help from the fire department. But when the engine arrives, the officers give them, quote, “no clear info on Floyd or his whereabouts,” according to a fire department incident report. This delays their ability to help the paramedics. Meanwhile, Floyd is going into cardiac arrest. It takes the engine five minutes to reach Floyd in the ambulance. He’s pronounced dead at a nearby hospital around 9:25 p.m. Preliminary autopsies conducted by the state and Floyd’s family both ruled his death a homicide. The widely circulated arrest videos don’t paint the entire picture of what happened to George Floyd. Crowd: “Floyd! Floyd!” Additional video and audio from the body cameras of the key officers would reveal more about why the struggle began and how it escalated. The city quickly fired all four officers. And Chauvin has been charged with second degree murder. Thomas Lane, J. Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao were charged with aiding and abetting murder. But outrage over George Floyd’s death has only spread further and further across the United States.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nThree former Minneapolis police officers were criminally charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder in connection with Floyd's death, and Chauvin's charge was upgraded to second-degree murder.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Five police officers suffered slight injuries, and one was severely injured. Another five gendarmes were hurt as well.\n\nProtesters wearing yellow vests demonstrate on the Promenade des Anglais in Nice, southern France, on Saturday. Eric Gaillard/Reuters\n\nSpeaking about the death, French Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said: “That’s the reason why we were worried to have people (who are) not experienced organizing protests.”\n\nEcology Minister François de Rugy called on citizens to “respect caution and safety recommendations” in order for protests to go ahead “without a new tragedy,” in a tweet Saturday. He also offered his condolences to the family of the victim.\n\nMore than 1 million people were expected to turn out Saturday for demonstrations across the country. Partway through the day, the numbers were much lower than that.\n\nAbout 280,000 people participated in more than 2,000 demonstrations, the Interior Ministry said.\n\n“Honestly we’re satisfied, even if it’s true we are not hundreds of thousands people here, but still, people have come. The day is not over yet, and we’re glad that there are no incidents here,” Thierry Paul Valette, who helped organize a protest on the Champs Elysées in Paris, told CNN.\n\n“We can’t stand Macron’s taxes any more. It’s too much. We couldn’t make ourselves heard through political parties or trade unions, so we had to do something.”\n\nPeople wearing yellow vests block the motorway in Antibes, southeastern France, on Saturday. Eric Gaillard/Reuters\n\nThe protest was billed as likely to be one of the toughest tests yet of Emmanuel Macron’s 18-month-old presidency.\n\nWebsite blocage17novembre said protests were planned in all 95 of France’s mainland departments, while a petition on change.org calling on the French government to lower the cost of fuel has gotten more than 850,000 signatures.\n\nIn addition to concerns over spiraling fuel prices, the protests also reflect long-running tensions between the metropolitan elite and rural poor.\n\nPrice hike\n\nDiesel prices have surged 16% this year from an average 1.24 euros ($1.41) per liter to 1.48 euros ($1.69), even hitting 1.53 euros in October, according to UFIP, France’s oil industry federation.\n\nThe price hike is largely caused by a leap in the wholesale price of oil, with Brent crude oil – a benchmark for worldwide oil purchases – increasing by more than 20% in the first half of 2018 from around $60 a barrel to a peak of $86.07 in early October.\n\nA protest against rising fuel and oil prices takes place in Nice, southeastern France, on November 15. VALERY HACHE/AFP/Getty Images\n\nFrench protesters are, however, not directing their anger at OPEC for reducing oil production, or at the US administration for implementing tariffs on Iran, crippling its oil exports.\n\nMacron is instead bearing the brunt of widespread French discontent, with many protesters furious at the current leader’s extension of environmental policies implemented under François Hollande’s government.\n\nNotably, taxes were increased by 8 centimes last January on diesel, and by 4 centimes on petrol. Tax on diesel will also increase by another 6.4 centimes in 2019, and by 2.9 centimes for petrol. These rises follow many decades of under-taxation of diesel in France.\n\nMacron criticized\n\nThe growing resentment has also been a springboard for partisan political attacks, with opponents of Macron’s centrist En Marche party attempting to energize their bases to fuel further revolt.\n\n“This government hasn’t understood the anger of the French,” Olivier Faure, head of the French Socialist Party, said Wednesday.\n\n“Macron has not heard the French,” Laurent Wauquiez, leader of the center-right party Les Républicains, added in an interview for BFMTV and RMC radio.\n\nMeanwhile, Macron’s former nemesis, Marine Le Pen, leader of France’s far-right National Rally, said: “We were the first party to express our total support for this movement.”\n\nCastaner hit back at Macron’s opponents, branding the protests “political” and accusing Les Républicains of being behind them.\n\n“It’s a political protest with the Republicans behind it, and it’s irrational because the rising taxes have been compensated by the decline in the oil market,” he told CNN’s French affiliate BFMTV. “We hear the protests, we hear the anger, I know the situation, but we have to explain that it’s essential that we exit fossil fuels.”\n\nThe minister said police would be present to break up any dangerous roadblocks. “I am asking for the roads to not be completely blocked,” Castaner said. “Where there is a roadblock – which means there’s a risk for emergency services – there will be police.”\n\nMacron struck a more conciliatory tone in an interview Wednesday, saying: “I hear the anger, and it’s a fundamental right in our society to be allowed to express it.”\n\nHe nevertheless admitted that he was “wary because many different people are trying to piggyback on this movement.”\n\nPrime Minister Edouard Philippe also announced close to 500 million euros in aid to low-income motorists in a key concession Wednesday.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\n130 people were arrested across France, including 42 in Paris.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

This review concisely synthesizes the latest research and practical applications of ChatGPT within the clinical, educational, and research domains of veterinary medicine. It intends to provide specific guidance and actionable examples of how generative AI can be directly utilized by veterinary professionals without a programming background. For practitioners, ChatGPT can extract patient data, generate progress notes, and potentially assist in diagnosing complex cases. Veterinary educators can create custom GPTs for student support, while students can utilize ChatGPT for exam preparation. ChatGPT can aid in academic writing tasks in research, but veterinary publishers have set specific requirements for authors to follow. Despite its transformative potential, careful use is essential to avoid pitfalls like hallucination. This review addresses ethical considerations, provides learning resources, and offers tangible examples to guide responsible implementation. A table of key takeaways was provided to summarize this review. By highlighting potential benefits and limitations, this review equips veterinarians, educators, and researchers to harness the power of ChatGPT effectively.\n\nIntroduction\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is a trending topic in veterinary medicine. A recent survey on AI in veterinary medicine by Digital and the American Animal Hospital Association, involving 3,968 veterinarians, veterinary technicians/assistants, and students, showed 83.8% of respondents were familiar with AI and its applications in veterinary medicine, with 69.5% using AI tools daily or weekly (1). Yet, 36.9% remain skeptical, citing concerns about the systems’ reliability and accuracy (70.3%), data security and privacy (53.9%), and the lack of training (42.9%) (1).\n\nThe current application of AI in veterinary medicine cover a wide range of topics, such as dental radiograph (2), colic detection (3), and mitosis detection in digital pathology (4). Machine learning (ML), a subset of AI, enables systems to learn from data without being explicitly programmed (5). Generative AI (genAI), in turn, is a field within ML specializing in creating new content. As a subset of genAI, large language models (LLMs) are known for their human-like text generation capabilities. Notable LLMs include ChatGPT (OpenAI) (6), which is utilized by Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 (7), Llama 3 (Meta) (8), Gemini (Google) (9), and Claude 3 (Anthropic) (10). ChatGPT, initially powered by GPT-3.5, was made publicly accessible by OpenAI on November 30, 2022 (11). In less than a year, ChatGPT has attracted approximately a hundred million weekly users (12), making it the most popular LLM for newcomers to this technology. Based on PubMed search results, academic articles mentioned ‘ChatGPT’ in the title or abstract grew from 4 in 2022 to 2,062 in 2023, indicating a growing interest in ChatGPT in the medical field (13). Therefore, this review will focus on ChatGPT as the main example of generative AI and discuss its application in veterinary clinics, education, and research.\n\nGPT, or Generative Pre-trained Transformer, excels in generating new text, images, and other content formats rather than solely analyzing existing data. It is pre-trained by exposure to vast datasets of text and code, enabling it to recognize patterns and generate human-like responses. It employs the transformer neural network architecture that is particularly adept at processing language, which enables coherent and contextually relevant outputs (14). The free version of ChatGPT provides the capability of answering questions, providing explanations, generating creative content, offering advice, conducting research, engaging in conversation, supporting technical tasks, aiding with education, and creating summaries. On February 1, 2023, OpenAI released ChatGPT Plus, a subscription-based model later powered by GPT-4, which has capabilities in text, image, and voice analysis and generation (15). OpenAI introduced GPT-4 Turbo with Vision on April 9, 2024 (16). This updated model is accessible to developers through the application programming interface (API). Its ability of taking in images and answer questions has sparked interest in radiology (17, 18), pathology (19), and cancer detection (20, 21). On May 13, 2024, OpenAI released GPT-4o to the public. The ‘o’ in its name emphasizes the new model’s omnipotent in reading, listing, writing, and speaking abilities (22). Despite ChatGPT’s widespread use, a comprehensive review of its applications in veterinary medicine is lacking.\n\nThe breadth of ChatGPT in medicine covers a wide range of areas, ranging from answering patient and professional inquiries, promoting patient engagement (23), diagnosing complex clinical cases (24), and creating educational material (25). Searching ‘ChatGPT AND veterinary’ in PubMed yielded 14 results until May 2024. After examining the title and abstract of all articles, 5 articles were deemed relevant to the subject and were included in the review (26–30). In addition, online search using the same combination of keywords identified commercial software that integrated ChatGPT to enhance virtual assistance, diagnostic accuracy, communication with pet owners, and optimization of workflows (31–37). While examples of ChatGPT applications are prevalent on social media and in various publications (38–40), the best way to understand its impact is through direct engagement. This article aims to discuss the applications of ChatGPT in veterinary medicine, provide practical implementations, and examine its limitations and ethical considerations. The following content will use’ ChatGPT’ as a general term. When the information of specific versions of ChatGPT is available, terms such as GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 will be used. Highlights of each section are listed in Table 1 for a quick summary of the review.\n\nTable 1\n\nTable 1. Key takeaways of the review.\n\nChatGPT 101: prompts and prompt engineering\n\nUnderstanding prompts is crucial before engaging with ChatGPT or other generative AI tools. Prompts act as conversation starters, consisting of instructions or queries that elicit responses from the AI. Effective prompts for ChatGPT integrate relevant details and context, enabling the model to deliver precise responses (28). Prompt engineering is the practice of refining inputs to produce optimal outputs. For instance, researchers instructing ChatGPT to identify body condition scores from clinical records begin prompts by detailing the data structure and desired outcomes: “Each row of the dataset is a different veterinary consultation. In the column ‘Narrative’ there is clinical text. Your task is to extract Body Condition Score (BCS) of the animal at the moment of the consultation if recorded. BCS can be presented on a 9-point scale, example BCS 6/9, or on a 5-point scale, example BCS 3.5/5. Your output should be presented in a short-text version ONLY, following the rules below: … (omitted) (28)”. Writing effective prompts involves providing contextual details in a clear and specific way and willingness to refine them as needed.\n\nMoreover, incorporating ‘cognitive strategy prompts’ can direct ChatGPT’s reasoning more effectively (refer to Supplementary material for more details). For a comprehensive understanding of prompt engineering, readers are encouraged to refer to specialized literature and open-access online courses dedicated to this subject (41–44). Proper prompt engineering is pivotal for shaping conversations and obtaining the intended results, as illustrated by various examples in this review (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1\n\nFigure 1. Visual abstract of the review.\n\nUsing ChatGPT in clinical care\n\nChatGPT has the potential to provide immediate assistance upon the client’s arrival at the clinic. In human medicine, the pre-trained GPT-4 model is adept at processing chief complaints, vital signs, and medical histories entered by emergency medicine physicians, subsequently making triage decisions that align closely with established standards (45). Given that healthcare professionals in the United States spend approximately 35% of their time documenting patient information (46) and that note redundancy is on the rise (47), ChatGPT ‘s ability to distill crucial information from extensive clinical histories and generate clinical documents are particularly valuable (48). In veterinary medicine, a study utilizing GPT-3.5 Turbo for text mining demonstrated the AI’s capability to pinpoint all overweight body condition score (BCS) instances within a dataset with high precision (28). However, some limitations were noted, such as the misclassification of lameness scoring as BCS, an issue that the researchers believe could be addressed through refined prompt engineering (28).\n\nFor daily clinical documentation in veterinary settings, veterinarians can input signalment, clinical history, and physical examination findings into ChatGPT to generate Subjective-Objective-Assessment-Plan (SOAP) notes (46). An illustrative veterinary case presented in Supplementary material involved the generation of a SOAP note for a canine albuterol toxicosis incident (49), where ChatGPT efficiently identified the diagnostic tests executed in the case report, demonstrating that ChatGPT can be used as a promising tool to streamline the workflow for veterinarians.\n\nMoreover, recent research has investigated ChatGPT’s proficiency in human clinical challenges. One study found that GPT-4 could accurately diagnose 57% of complex medical cases, a success rate that outperformed 72% of human readers of medical journals in answering multiple-choice questions (24). Additionally, GPT-4’s top diagnosis concurred with the final diagnosis in 39% of cases and included the final diagnosis within the top differential diagnoses in 64% of cases (50). In veterinary medicine, a notable case is a man on social media platform X (previously known as Twitter), who reported that ChatGPT saved his dog’s life by identifying immune-mediated hemolytic anemia—a diagnosis his veterinarian had missed (51). Veterinarians should recognize that pet owners may consult ChatGPT or similar AI chatbots for advice due to their accessibility (26). While the proliferation of veterinary information online can enhance general knowledge among clients, it also risks spreading misinformation (52). Customizing ChatGPT could address these challenges (refer to ‘Using ChatGPT in Veterinary Education’ below).\n\nIn a human medicine study, GPT-4 can interpret ECGs and outperformed other LLM tools in correctly interpreting 63% of ECG images (53). A similar study has yet to be found in veterinary medicine. A veterinary example is provided in the Supplementary material, showing that GPT-4 did not identify an atypical atrial flutter with intermittent Ashman phenomenon in a 9-year-old Pug despite the addition of asterisks in the ECG to indicate the wide and tall aberrant QRS complexes (35). This example emphasizes that while ChatGPT is a powerful tool, it cannot replace specialized AI algorithms approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for ECG interpretation (54, 55). Nevertheless, advances in veterinary-specific AI tools, such as a deep learning model for canine ECG classification, are on the horizon, with the potential to be available soon (56). With the updated image upload function, the capability of GPT-4 and GPT-4o extends to the interpretation of blood work images. The Supplementary material illustrates a veterinary example of GPT-4 and GPT-4o analyzing Case of the Month on eClinPath (57) and providing the correct top differential despite its limited ability to interpret the white blood cell dot plot.\n\nUsing ChatGPT in veterinary education\n\nRecent studies leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) in medical examinations underscore their utility in educational support. In human medical education, GPT-3’s performance, evaluated using 350 questions from the United States Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE) Steps 1, 2CK, and 3, was commendable, achieving scores near or at the passing threshold across all three levels without specialized training (58). This evaluation involved modifying the exam questions into various formats—open-ended or multiple-choice with or without a forced justification—to gage ChatGPT’s foundational medical knowledge. The AI-generated responses often included key insights, suggesting that ChatGPT’s output could benefit medical students preparing for USMLE (58).\n\nAnother investigation in human medical education benchmarked the efficacy of GPT-4, Claude 2, and various open-source LLMs using multiple-choice questions from the Nephrology Self-Assessment Program. Success rates varied widely, with open-source LLMs scoring between 17.1–30.6%, Claude 2 at 54.4%, and GPT-4 leading with 73.7% (59). A comparative analysis of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 indicates the newer version substantially improved in the neonatal-perinatal medicine board examination (60). In the veterinary education context, researchers at the University of Georgia used GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 to answer faculty-generated 495 multiple-choice and true/false questions from 15 courses in the third-year veterinary curriculum (27). The result concurred with the previous study that GPT-4 (77% correct rate) performed substantially better than GPT-3.5 (55% correct rate); however, their performance is significantly lower than that of veterinary students (86%). These studies highlight the variances in LLM knowledge bases, which could affect the quality of medical and veterinary education.\n\nBeyond exam preparation, the ChatGPT Plus subscribers can create customized ChatGPT, referred to as GPTs (41) that are freely accessible to other users (61). Veterinarians, for instance, can harness these tools to develop AI tutors to educate clients and boost veterinary students’ learning. For client education, the Cornell Feline Health Center recently launched ‘CatGPT,’ a customized ChatGPT that draws information from its website and peer-reviewed scientific publications to answer owner’s inquiries (62). An example of a custom GPT is a specialized veterinary clinical pathology virtual tutor named VetClinPathGPT (63). This custom GPT draws from legally available open-access textbooks with Creative Commons licenses (64–66) and the eClinPath website (57), ensuring the information provided is sourced from credible references. Students are encouraged to pose any question pertinent to veterinary clinical pathology and can even request specific references or links to web pages. More information about this GPT is detailed in the Supplementary material.\n\nUsing ChatGPT in academic writing\n\nThe incorporation of AI in academic writing, particularly in the field of medical research, is a topic marked by considerably more controversy than the previous sections discussed. Ever since the development of GPT-3 in 2020, its text-generating ability has ignited debate within academia (67). Leveraging editing services enhances clarity and minimizes grammatical errors in scientific manuscripts, which can improve their acceptance rate (68). While acknowledgments often thank editorial assistance, the use of spelling-checking software is rarely disclosed. Nowadays, AI-powered writing assistants have integrated advanced LLM capabilities to provide nuanced suggestions for tone and context (45), thus merging the line between original and AI-generated content. Generative AI, like ChatGPT, extends its utility by proposing titles, structuring papers, crafting abstracts, and summarizing research, raising questions about the AI’s role in authorship as per the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors’ guidelines (69) (Supplementary material). Notably, traditional scientific journals are cautious with AI, yet NEJM AI stands out for its advocacy for LLM use (70). However, these journals still refrain from recognizing ChatGPT as a co-author due to accountability concerns over accuracy and ethical integrity (70–72). The academic community remains wary of ChatGPT’s potential to overshadow faculty contributions (73).\n\nSeveral veterinary journals have updated their guidelines in response to the emergence of generative AI. Among the top 20 veterinary medicine journals as per Google Scholar (74), 14 instruct on generative AI usage (Supplementary material). They unanimously advise against listing AI as a co-author, mandating disclosure of AI involvement in Methods, Acknowledgments, or other designated sections. These recommendations typically do not apply to basic grammar and editing tools (Supplementary material). AI could enhance writing efficiency and potentially alleviate disparities in productivity, posing a nuanced proposition that suggests broader acceptance of AI in academia might benefit less skillful writers and foster a more inclusive scholarly community (40).\n\nThe detectability of AI-generated content and the associated risks of erroneous academic judgments have become significant concerns. A misjudgment has led an ecologist at Cornell University to face publication rejection after being falsely accused by a reviewer who deemed her work as “obviously ChatGPT” (75). However, a study revealed that reviewers could only identify 68% of ChatGPT-produced scientific abstracts, and they also mistakenly tagged 14% of original works as AI-generated (76). In a veterinary study, veterinary neurologists only had a 31–54% success rate in distinguishing AI-crafted abstracts from authentic works (30).\n\nTo counteract this, a ‘ChatGPT detector’ has been suggested. An ML tool utilizes distinguishing features like paragraph complexity, sentence length variability, punctuation marks, and popular wordings, achieving over 99% effectiveness in identifying AI-authored texts (77). A subsequent refined model can further distinguish human writings from GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 writings in chemistry journals with 99% accuracy (78). While these tools are not publicly accessible, OpenAI is developing a classifier to flag AI-generated text (79), emphasizing the importance of academic integrity and responsible AI use.\n\nChatGPT’s limitations and ethical issues\n\nHallucination and inaccuracy\n\nHallucination, or artificial hallucination, refers to the generation of implausible but confident responses by ChatGPT, which poses a significant issue (80). ChatGPT is known to create fabricated references with incoherent Pubmed ID (81), a problem somewhat mitigated in GPT-4 (18% error rate) compared to GPT-3.5 (55% error rate) (82). The Supplementary material illustrated an example where GPT-4 could have provided more accurate references, including PMIDs, underscoring its limitations for literature searches.\n\nIn the medical field, accuracy is paramount, and ChatGPT’s inaccuracy can have serious consequences for patients. A study evaluating GPT-3.5’s performance in medical decision-making across 17 specialties found that the model largely generated accurate information but could be surprisingly wrong in multiple instances (83). Another study highlighted that while GPT-3.5 (Dec 15 version) can effectively simplify radiology reports for patients, it could produce obviously incorrect interpretations, potentially harming patients (84). With the deployment of GPT-4 and GPT-4o, the updated database should bring expected improvement; however, these inaccuracies underscore the necessity of using ChatGPT cautiously and in conjunction with professional medical advice.\n\nIntellectual property, cybersecurity, and privacy\n\nAs an LLM, ChatGPT is trained using undisclosed but purportedly accessible online data and ongoing refinement through user interactions during conversations (85). It raises concerns about copyright infringement and privacy violations, as evidenced by ongoing lawsuits against OpenAI for allegedly using private or public information without their permission (86–88). Based on information from the OpenAI website, user-generated content is consistently gathered and used to enhance the service and for research purposes (89). This statement implies that any identifiable patient information could be at risk. Therefore, robust cybersecurity measures are necessary to protect patient privacy and ensure compliance with legal standards in medical settings (90). When analyzing clinical data using AI chatbot, uploading de-identified datasets is suggested. Alternatively, considering local installations of open-source, free-for-research-use LLMs, like Llama 3 or Gemma (Google), for enhanced security is recommended (91–94).\n\nUS FDA regulation\n\nWhile the FDA has approved 882 AI and ML-enabled human medical devices, primarily in radiology (76.1%), followed by cardiology (10.2%) and neurology (3.6%) (95), veterinary medicine lacks specific premarket requirements for AI tools. The AI- and ML-enabled veterinary products currently span from dictation and notetaking apps (34, 35), management and communication software (36, 37), radiology service (31–33), and personalized chemotherapy (96), to name a few. These products may or may not have scientific validation (97–104) and may be utilized by veterinarians despite the clients’ lack of consent or complete understanding. In veterinary medicine, the absence of regulatory oversight, especially in diagnostic imaging, calls for ethical and legal considerations to ensure patient safety in the United States and Canada (105, 106). LLM tools like ChatGPT pose specific regulatory challenges, such as patient data privacy, medical malpractice liability, and informed consent (107). Continuous monitoring and validation are the key, as these models are continuously learning and updating after launch. As of today, FDA has not authorized any medical devices that use genAI or LLM.\n\nPractical learning resources\n\nResources for learning about ChatGPT and generative AI are abundant, including AI companies’ documentation (108–110), online courses from Vanderbilt University and IBM on Coursera (41, 111), Harvard University’s tutorial for generative AI (112), and the University of Michigan’s guides on using generative AI for scientific research (113). These resources are invaluable for veterinarians seeking to navigate the evolving landscape of AI in their practice. Last but not least, readers are advised to engage ChatGPT with well-structured prompts, such as: ‘I’m a veterinarian with no background in programming. I’m interested in learning how to use generative AI tools like ChatGPT. Can you recommend some resources for beginners?’ (see Supplementary material).\n\nThe ongoing dialog\n\nIn the 2023 Responsible AI for Social and Ethical Healthcare (RAISE) Conference held by the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Harvard Medical School, several principles on the judicious application of AI in human healthcare were highlighted (114). These principles could be effectively adapted to veterinary medicine. Integrating AI into veterinary practices should amplify the benefits to animal welfare, enhance clinical outcomes, broaden access to veterinary services, and enrich the patient and client experience. AI should support rather than replace veterinarians, preserving the essential human touch in animal care.\n\nTransparent and ethical utilization of patient data is paramount, advocating for opt-out mechanisms in data collection processes while safeguarding client confidentiality. AI tools in the veterinary field ought to be envisioned as adjuncts to clinical expertise, with a potential for their role to develop progressively, subject to stringent oversight. The growing need for direct consumer access to AI in veterinary medicine promises advancements but necessitates meticulous regulation to assure pet owners about data provenance and the application of AI.\n\nThis review discussed the transformative potential of ChatGPT across clinical, educational, and research domains within veterinary medicine. Continuous dialog, awareness of limitations, and regulatory oversight are crucial to ensure generative AI augments clinical care, educational standards, and academic ethics rather than compromising them. The examples provided in the Supplementary material encourage innovative integration of AI tools into veterinary practice. By embracing responsible adoption, veterinary professionals can harness the full potential of ChatGPT to make the next paradigm shift in veterinary medicine.\n\nAuthor contributions\n\nCC: Conceptualization, Project administration, Resources, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review & editing, Investigation.\n\nFunding\n\nThe author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

That process could take at least two years.\n\nBoris Johnson, the former mayor of London who campaigned for the UK’s departure from the EU, is tipped by bookmakers as Cameron’s likely successor.\n\nJohnson, who was greeted by a booing crowd when he left his home on Friday morning, thanked voters for their decision, pledged that the UK would remain committed to Europe and urged unity.\n\n“I think the electorate have searched in their hearts and answered as honestly as they can,” he said. “They have decided to vote to take back control from a European Union that has become too remote.”\n\nFormer PM: There will be costs\n\nFormer British Prime Minister Tony Blair told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer that UK voters would learn over the next 24 months that leaving Europe will not solve their economic troubles, ease their apprehensions or make Britain more independent in a meaningful way.\n\n“I literally cannot think of a big decision that I was not able to take because of Europe,” Blair said. “There is so much anger at the moment that the anger replaces the more rational answers.”\n\nBlair noted that the United States was facing the same type of political fracturing, brought on by economic turmoil, globalization and anger at immigration.\n\n“Getting out of Europe is not the answer,” he said, noting the UK sells half of its goods and services to the EU. “We are going to have to negotiate ourselves back into that market and it will be much more difficult than these people understand.”\n\nPossible Scottish independence vote\n\nIn Scotland, where support was overwhelmingly in favor of remaining in the EU, Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s First Minister and leader of the dominant Scottish National Party, said the outcome threw into doubt the future of her country’s place in the UK.\n\nShe said the Scottish government will begin preparing legislation for a new independence referendum if the Scottish Parliament decides it wants to hold one. Scots voted down a bid for independence from the UK in 2014.\n\n“Democratically unacceptable,” said Sturgeon in describing the fact that Scotland would be pulled out of the European Union despite the majority of the Scottish people voting to stay in.\n\nMORE: What does Brexit mean for you?\n\nSinn Fein calls for Irish unity\n\nThe Sinn Féin party in Northern Ireland called for a referendum on Irish unity, which could take Northern Ireland out of the UK and join it with the Republic of Ireland, an EU member.\n\nVoters in Northern Ireland voted for the UK to remain in the EU.\n\nSinn Féin President Gerry Adams said the Brexit result could portend tougher border rules – with barriers and custom posts – between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, because it will be the only land border between the EU and the UK.\n\nAdams said such a result would be unacceptable given the vote result in Northern Ireland and could undermine the cooperative relationships and that have developed between the two Irelands since the Good Friday agreement.\n\n“My issue is the north of Ireland is going to be dragged out of the EU on the decision made by people on another island,” said Adams, whose political party is dedicated to the reunification of Ireland.\n\n“We’re calling for a poll, a referendum, on Irish unity, on the border. This (the Brexit vote) has the potential to set back the good work that’s been done in terms of the peace process, building harmony, building infrastructure.”\n\n‘Dying’ institution\n\nAs European leaders faced their own crises, German Chancellor Angela Merkel stressed the “need to make sure that European people feel that the EU wants to improve all our lives.”\n\nShe said she greatly regretted the UK’s decision, but added, “The EU is strong enough to find the right answers today.”\n\nFrench President Francois Hollande called it a “painful choice which I deeply regret for the UK and Europe.”\n\nItaly’s finance minister, Pier Carlo Padoan, warned of a domino effect amid calls for further exit votes.\n\nFar-right Dutch politician Geert Wilders congratulated the UK on its decision and called for a Dutch referendum on EU membership.\n\n“We want to be in charge of our own country, our own money, our own borders and our own immigration policy,” he was quoted as saying in a statement on his website.\n\nMarine Le Pen, the leader of France’s National Front party who plans to run for the French presidency next year, also congratulated the Brexit side.\n\nHer party has suggested the French will also hold an “out” referendum if she assumes the presidency.\n\nPassions continued to run high in the UK in the hours after the vote, with UK Independence Party (UKIP) leader and Leave campaigner Nigel Farage declaring the EU a “dying” institution.\n\n“We’ve given ourselves the chance to rejoin the world,” he told journalists. “June 23rd needs to become a national bank holiday and we will call it Independence Day.”\n\nU.S. President Barack Obama said that while the UK’s relationship with Europe was changing, the ties that bound the UK to the United States and the United States to Europe would remain.\n\n“I do think yesterday’s vote speaks to ongoing changes and challenges that are raised by globalization, but the UK’s relationship with the EU will change. What will not change is the special relationship that exists between our two nations,” Obama said. “That will endure. And the EU will remain one of our indispensable partners.”\n\nMORE: Full coverage of the UK referendum\n\nNATO: UK will stay a strong ally\n\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg voiced reassurances that the United Kingdom will remain a strong and committed NATO ally despite the vote.\n\n“Today, as we face more instability and uncertainty, NATO is more important than ever as a platform for cooperation among European allies and between Europe and North America,” said Stoltenberg. “A strong, united and determined NATO remains an essential pillar of stability in a turbulent world and a key contributor to international peace and security.”\n\nVoters react\n\nThe referendum followed one of the most divisive political campaigns in recent memory. Polls consistently showed voters split down the middle, with the outcome too close to call ahead of the vote.\n\nNews of the decision sparked strong emotions, with those in favor and those against reflecting on a campaign marred by allegations of lies, distrust and hate.\n\n“This is so sad,” said Daniel Trilling on Twitter. “Millions of people aren’t going to feel any more in control of their lives or their country because of this vote.”\n\n“People vote on emotion,” Twitter user @cemanthe posted. “This was won on false promises and emotive texts about immigration. Not on facts.”\n\n“I am SO happy this morning,” wrote another, Gemma.\n\nAn online petition calling for a second referendum gathered more than 120,000 signatures within hours of being posted.\n\nLeading political figures gave mixed reactions.\n\nTony Blair, the former UK prime minister, called the decision a divided result.\n\n“It’s going to be a complicated process but it’s important to bring our country together and stabilize our country,” he told CNN’s Becky Anderson. “It’s still a resilient country and it’s a strong country.”\n\nSadiq Khan, the mayor of largely pro-EU London, said the decision was a “clear message” and urged calm.\n\n‘Taking back control’\n\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk said the decision was “historic, but not a moment for hysterical reactions.”\n\nDonald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee in the U.S. presidential election, hailed the UK’s decision to “reassert control over their own politics, borders and economy.”\n\nIn a news conference Friday as he attended the official opening of a remodeled golf resort bearing his name in Turnberry, Scotland, Trump called the decision of the voters “a great thing.”\n\n“They’re angry over borders, they’re angry over people coming into the country and taking over. Nobody even knows who they are,” he said. “They’re angry about many, many things. They took back control of their country.”\n\nUKIP’s Farage told CNN’s Nima Elbagir that the economic fears in the wake of the EU departure were overstated, and that he expected an even better relationship with the United States. He said the vote was a repudiation of bullying tactics by corporate and political powers to keep the UK in the EU.\n\n“(We were) threatened by everybody that if we didn’t stay part of this political union, dreadful things would happen to us, and what happened were the little people, the regular people, the ordinary people said, ‘No, this is wrong,’” Farage said.\n\n“When you really think about it, what we’ve done isn’t actually that radical. … We want to be a democratic nation. We want to make our own laws in our own parliament, have our own supreme court, and control our own border. If you think about, there’s now 183 countries around the world that have independence days. What we did yesterday was become 184th.”\n\nOpinion: Why Brexit vote should worry Trump\n\nMarkets plunge\n\nThe effects of the vote outcome were immediately felt in markets and economies around the world.\n\nIn New York, the Dow ended the day down more than 611 points, to close at 17,399. London’s FTSE index shed $164 billion of its value in the first 10 minutes of trading, but regained ground later in the day.\n\nThe NASDAQ index fell more than 4% and into a correction, or down 10% from recent highs.\n\nThe British pound at one point plunged more than 12% to below $1.34, its lowest level since 1985. Japan’s Nikkei tanked 6.7% and Hong Kong’s main index dropped 3.7%.\n\nBank of England Governor Mark Carney said the body is “well prepared” and “won’t hesitate” to take additional measures as markets adjust.\n\nThe “UK financial system is resilient,” he added.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nThe British pound plunged in value.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

One of them, a police source, said that the department had collected more than enough evidence to prosecute Weinstein. But the other said that Gutierrez’s statements about her past complicated the case for the office of the Manhattan District Attorney, Cyrus Vance, Jr. After two weeks of investigation, the D.A.’s office decided not to file charges. The office declined to comment on this story but pointed me to its statement at the time: “This case was taken seriously from the outset, with a thorough investigation conducted by our Sex Crimes Unit. After analyzing the available evidence, including multiple interviews with both parties, a criminal charge is not supported.”\n\n“We had the evidence,” the police source involved in the operation told me. “It’s a case that made me angrier than I thought possible, and I have been on the force a long time.”\n\nGutierrez, when contacted for this story, said that she was unable to discuss the incident. Someone close to the matter told me that, after the D.A.’s office decided not to press charges, Gutierrez, facing Weinstein’s legal team, and in return for a payment, signed a highly restrictive nondisclosure agreement with Weinstein, including an affidavit stating that the acts he admits to in the recording never happened.\n\nWeinstein’s use of such settlements was reported by the Times and confirmed to me by numerous people. A former employee with firsthand knowledge of two settlement negotiations that took place in London in the nineteen-nineties recalled, “It felt like David versus Goliath . . . the guy with all the money and the power flexing his muscle and quashing the allegations and getting rid of them.”\n\n6.\n\nThe Times story disclosed a complaint to the Weinstein Company’s office of human resources, filed on behalf of a temporary front-desk assistant named Emily Nestor in December, 2014. Her own account of Weinstein’s conduct is being made public here for the first time. Nestor was twenty-five when she started the job and, after finishing law school and starting business school, was considering a career in the movie industry. On her first day in the position, Nestor said, two employees told her that she was Weinstein’s “type” physically. When Weinstein arrived at the office, he made comments about her appearance, referring to her as “the pretty girl.” He asked how old she was, and then sent all of his assistants out of the room and made her write down her telephone number.\n\nWeinstein told her to meet him for drinks that night. Nestor invented an excuse. When he insisted, she suggested an early-morning coffee the next day, assuming that he wouldn’t accept. He did, and told her to meet him at the Peninsula hotel in Beverly Hills, where he was staying. Nestor said that she had talked with friends in the entertainment industry and employees in the company who had warned her about Weinstein’s reputation. “I dressed very frumpy,” she said.\n\nNestor told me that the meeting was “the most excruciating and uncomfortable hour of my life.” After Weinstein offered her career help, she said, he began to boast about his sexual liaisons with other women, including famous actresses. “He said, ‘You know, we could have a lot of fun,’ ” Nestor recalled. “ ‘I could put you in my London office, and you could work there and you could be my girlfriend.’ ” She declined. He asked to hold her hand; she said no. In Nestor’s account of the exchange, Weinstein said, “Oh, the girls always say no. You know, ‘No, no.’ And then they have a beer or two and then they’re throwing themselves at me.” In a tone that Nestor described as “very weirdly proud,” Weinstein added “that he’d never had to do anything like Bill Cosby.” She assumed that he meant he’d never drugged a woman. “It’s just a bizarre thing to be so proud of,” she said. “That you’ve never had to resort to doing that. It was just so far removed from reality and normal rules of consent.”\n\n“Textbook sexual harassment” was how Nestor described Weinstein’s behavior to me. “It’s a pretty clear case of sexual harassment when your superior, the C.E.O., asks one of their inferiors, a temp, to have sex with them, essentially in exchange for mentorship.” She recalled refusing his advances at least a dozen times. “ ‘No’ did not mean ‘no’ to him,” she said. “I was very aware of how inappropriate it was. But I felt trapped.”\n\nThroughout the breakfast, she said, Weinstein interrupted their conversation to yell into his cell phone, enraged over a spat that Amy Adams, a star in the Weinstein movie “Big Eyes,” was having in the press. Afterward, Weinstein told Nestor to keep an eye on the news cycle, which he promised would be spun in his favor. Later in the day, there were indeed negative news items about his opponents, and Weinstein stopped by Nestor’s desk to be sure that she’d seen them.\n\nBy that point, Nestor recalled, “I was very afraid of him. And I knew how well connected he was. And how if I pissed him off then I could never have a career in that industry.” Still, she told a friend about the incident, and he alerted the company’s office of human resources, which contacted her. (The friend did not respond to a request for comment.) Nestor had a conversation with company officials about the matter but didn’t pursue it further: the officials said that Weinstein would be informed of anything she told them, a practice not uncommon in businesses the size of the Weinstein Company. Several former Weinstein employees told me that the company’s human-resources department was utterly ineffective; one female executive described it as “a place where you went to when you didn’t want anything to get done. That was common knowledge across the board. Because everything funnelled back to Harvey.” She described the department’s typical response to allegations of misconduct as “This is his company. If you don’t like it, you can leave.”\n\nNestor told me that some people at the company did seem concerned. Irwin Reiter, a senior executive who had worked for Weinstein for almost three decades, sent her a series of messages via LinkedIn. “We view this very seriously and I personally am very sorry your first day was like this,” Reiter wrote. “Also if there are further unwanted advances, please let us know.” Last year, just before the Presidential election, he reached out again, writing, “All this Trump stuff made me think of you.” He described Nestor’s experience as part of Weinstein’s serial misconduct. “I’ve fought him about mistreatment of women 3 weeks before the incident with you. I even wrote him an email that got me labelled by him as sex police,” he wrote. “The fight I had with him about you was epic. I told him if you were my daughter he would have not made out so well.” (Reiter declined to comment for this article, but his lawyer, Debra Katz, confirmed the authenticity of the messages and said that Reiter had made diligent efforts to raise these issues, to no avail. Katz also noted that Reiter “is eager to coöperate fully with any outside investigation.”)\n\nThough no assault occurred, and Nestor left after completing her temporary placement, she was profoundly affected by the experience. “I was definitely traumatized for a while, in terms of feeling so harassed and frightened,” she said. “It made me feel incredibly discouraged that this could be something that happens on a regular basis. I actually decided not to go into entertainment because of this incident.”\n\n7.\n\nEmma de Caunes, a French actress, met Weinstein in 2010, at a party at the Cannes Film Festival. A few months later, he asked her to a lunch meeting at the Hôtel Ritz, in Paris. In the meeting, Weinstein told de Caunes that he was going to be producing a movie with a prominent director, that he planned to shoot it in France, and that it had a strong female role. It was an adaptation of a book, he said, but he claimed he couldn’t remember the title. “But I’ll give it to you,” Weinstein said, according to de Caunes. “I have it in my room.”\n\nDe Caunes replied that she had to leave, since she was already running late for a TV show she was hosting—Eminem was appearing on the show that afternoon, and she hadn’t written her questions yet. Weinstein pleaded with her to retrieve the book with him, and finally she agreed. As they got to his room, she received a telephone call from one of her colleagues, and Weinstein disappeared into a bathroom, leaving the door open. She assumed that he was washing his hands.\n\n“When I hung up the phone, I heard the shower go on in the bathroom,” she said. “I was, like, What the fuck, is he taking a shower?” Weinstein came out, naked and with an erection. “What are you doing?” she asked. Weinstein demanded that she lie on the bed and told her that many other women had done so before her.\n\n“I was very petrified,” de Caunes said. “But I didn’t want to show him that I was petrified, because I could feel that the more I was freaking out, the more he was excited.” She added, “It was like a hunter with a wild animal. The fear turns him on.” De Caunes told Weinstein that she was leaving, and he panicked. “We haven’t done anything!” she remembered him saying. “It’s like being in a Walt Disney movie!”\n\nDe Caunes told me, “I looked at him and I said—it took all my courage, but I said, ‘I’ve always hated Walt Disney movies.’ And then I left. I slammed the door.” She was shaking on the stairs going down to the lobby. A director she was working with on the TV show confirmed that she arrived at the studio distraught and that she recounted what had happened. Weinstein called relentlessly over the next few hours, offering de Caunes gifts and repeating his assertion that nothing had happened.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nThe New York Times published an investigation into Harvey Weinstein's sexual harassment on October 5, 2017.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Courtesy TV Asahi\n\nThe start of the release on Thursday afternoon sparked a fiery tirade from China which described the operation as a “selfish and irresponsible act.”\n\nChina’s customs department then announced it would stop importing all aquatic products originating from Japan – meaning the ban could potentially limit other oceanic products besides seafood such as sea salt and seaweed.\n\nThe move was aimed at preventing “the risk of radioactive contamination of food safety caused by Japan’s Fukushima nuclear contaminated water discharge,” and to protect the health of Chinese consumers, the customs department said in its statement.\n\nJapan has argued throughout the building controversy that discharging the treated water is safe and urgently needed to free up space at the crippled nuclear power plant.\n\nThe discharge began 1 p.m. local time (midnight ET), according to state-owned electricity firm Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO).\n\nThe treated radioactive wastewater will be highly diluted and released slowly over decades, said Japanese authorities. Courtesy TV Asahi\n\nThe company said it expects to discharge only around 200 or 210 cubic meters of treated wastewater. From Friday, it plans to then continuously release 456 cubic meters of treated wastewater over a 24-hour period and a total of 7,800 cubic meters over a 17-day period.\n\nTEPCO said that the operation would be suspended immediately and an investigation conducted if any abnormalities are detected in the discharge equipment or the dilution levels of the treated wastewater.\n\nIt will send a boat later Thursday into the harbor to collect samples to monitor and ensure the discharged treated wastewater meets international safety standards.\n\nJapan’s devastating 2011 earthquake and tsunami caused water within the Fukushima nuclear plant to be contaminated with highly radioactive material. Since then, new water has been pumped in to cool fuel debris in the reactors, while ground and rainwater have leaked in, creating more radioactive wastewater.\n\nThe plan to release the water has been in the works for years, with authorities warning in 2019 that space was running out to store the material and they had “no other options” but to release it in a treated and highly diluted form.\n\nA controversial decision\n\nWhile some governments have expressed support for Japan, others have strongly opposed the wastewater release, with many consumers in Asia hoarding salt and seafood amid fears of future contamination.\n\nThe US has backed Japan, and Taiwan has agreed that the amount of tritium being released should have “minimal” impact.\n\nHowever, China and the Pacific Islands have been vocal in their opposition, arguing the release could have broad regional and international impact, and potentially threaten human health and the marine environment.\n\nBefore China announced the seafood ban on Thursday, its foreign affairs ministry said the wastewater release would “pass on the risks to the whole world and extend the pain to future generations of humankind.”\n\nChinese social media was also awash in anger and dismay on Thursday, with a hashtag about the release gaining more than 800 million views on Weibo in just a few hours.\n\nMany users supported the seafood ban, while others called on authorities to take it a step further. “We should ban all Japanese products,” read one top comment.\n\nMany people in China continue to hold ambivalent feelings toward Japan. Despite the popularity of Japanese products and culture in China, calls to boycott all things Japanese are not uncommon whenever old grievances, triggered by current bilateral disputes, re-emerge.\n\nIn 2012, a series of anti-Japanese protests in cities across China turned violent after Japan decided to nationalize a group of islands in the East China Sea claimed by both Tokyo and Beijing.\n\nThe total ban on Japanese aquatic products and seafood expands on previous regulations that had already halted imports from Fukushima and nine other regions of Japan. Earlier this week, Hong Kong announced a similar ban on food imported from parts of Japan.\n\nBoth places – mainland China and Hong Kong – represent Japan’s top two biggest export markets for seafood, according to Japanese custom data, spelling potential trouble for the Japanese fishing industry.\n\nDespite the backlash, Japanese authorities and their international supporters, including the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog, argue the release is safe.\n\nOver the years, the wastewater has been continually treated to filter out all the removable harmful elements, then stored in tanks. Much of the water is treated a second time, according to TEPCO.\n\nWhen the wastewater is finally released, it will be heavily diluted with clean water so it has only very low concentrations of radioactive material. It will travel through an undersea tunnel about 1 kilometer (0.62 miles) off the coast, into the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThird parties will monitor the discharge during and after its release – including the UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).\n\nThe IAEA has staff stationed in a newly-opened Fukushima office and will monitor the situation for years to come, it said.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nThe Japanese government allocated $200 million to compensate the fishing industry and $340 million for local economic mitigation.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA. Japan announced its plan to release treated Fukushima wastewater into the sea.\nB. South Korea banned seafood imports from the Fukushima area.\nC.

She previously worked at Business Insider covering the military and global conflicts.\n\nThe short tenure of UK Prime Minister Liz Truss, seen here at a press conference on October 14, has been dominated by economic and political instability. Daniel Leal-WPA/Getty Images\n\nThe United Kingdom, not to mention the Conservative Party currently running it, is having a bumpy fall. So bumpy, in fact, that new prime minister Liz Truss has announced she will resign, after only six weeks in office.\n\n“I cannot deliver the mandate on which I was elected,” she said Thursday in brief remarks.\n\nTruss’s rapid fall from power came after she introduced Trussonomics, a plan for massive tax cuts aimed at Britain’s wealthiest, and then reversed course and apologized for all the economic turmoil the proposal created.\n\nThat proposed “mini budget,” which also included a rollback of corporate tax hikes and a break on planned cost increases for national insurance, had sent the British financial markets into a weeks-long tailspin. On top of a deepening cost-of-living crisis, Truss’s plan sent foreign investors fleeing from the British economy, driving the country’s currency to a record-low value against the dollar.\n\nThat economic chaos precipitated a political crisis: Truss’s grip on power slipped fast, as did public esteem for her Conservative Party.\n\nTruss had spent the past week trying to steady the economy and her premiership. On Monday, the UK’s new Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt announced a near-complete reversal of Trussonomics. That day, Truss told the BBC she would “accept responsibility and say sorry for the mistakes that have been made” and told interviewer Chris Mason that she intended to lead the Conservative Party through the next general election.\n\nHowever, the damage had already been done: She became the least popular prime minister in the history of polling. The Conservatives, or Tories as they’re commonly known, announced they will select their next leader — and therefore leader of the UK — by next Friday.\n\nIt’s an exceptionally fast timeline for the contest, which will be decided by Conservative members of Parliament and party members only. Quite a few names are already being floated, including some familiar ones: Rishi Sunak, who lost to Truss in the most recent contest, sure, but also Boris Johnson, who’s already being encouraged to return by his supporters.\n\nBut lurking underneath the immediate questions about leadership are bigger ones, about how much damage has been done to the Conservative Party as a whole.\n\n“This is end of times for the Conservatives unless they can get themselves back to some position of competence and some position of stability, which at the moment is looking very, very difficult,” Matthew Goodwin, a professor of politics at the University of Kent, told Vox earlier this week.\n\nTruss’s signature policy became her downfall\n\nTruss’s political crisis started with an economic one.\n\nOn September 23, Truss’s former chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng introduced the UK’s biggest tax cuts in 50 years, estimated at about 45 billion pounds over five years. The following Monday, investors soundly rejected the new economic plan, dubbed “Trussonomics” in reference to Reaganomics, the supply-side economic policies passed under Ronald Reagan in the 1980s. Global markets responded to the policy by selling off UK-backed assets and pushing the UK’s currency, the pound, to a valuation of $1.03, its lowest-ever value against the dollar, before it inched up later in the week.\n\nThe announcement of Kwarteng and Truss’s new plan also triggered a sell-off in government bonds — typically considered quite safe investments — which was so extreme that the Bank of England, the UK’s central bank, stepped in and purchased 65 billion pounds worth of bonds “to restore orderly market conditions” and float the country’s pension scheme.\n\nOne reason Trussonomics was so unnerving was the idea that the tax cuts would be financed by further borrowing. The UK already has a significant public debt burden — without new taxes, the UK’s Office for Budget Responsibility warned, public debt would balloon to 320 percent of Britain’s GDP in 50 years, up from 96 percent, or 2.4 trillion pounds, now.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) agreed, issuing an astonishing and nearly unprecedented rebuke against the tax cuts, which devalued the pound even further. “The nature of the UK measures will likely increase inequality,” the global lender said, urging the government to “consider ways to provide support that [are] more targeted and reevaluate the tax measures, especially those that benefit high-income earners.”\n\nIn the past week, Truss’s government had been trying to stanch the bleeding. Truss fired Kwarteng on October 14 and on Monday, Hunt, aiming to ease the economic crisis, made public the reversal of Truss’s economic plan, weeks earlier than planned.\n\n“We are a country that funds our promises and pays our debts,” Hunt said, rebuking Truss and Kwarteng’s intention to pay for their tax cuts by borrowing, and the very real possibility that their plan would eventually necessitate a cut in social services.\n\nHunt defended the reversal in Parliament later that day, with Truss sitting behind him, her silence telegraphing the rapid decline of her power and stature.\n\nThat day, Mark Blyth, director of the William Rhodes Center for International Economics and Finance at Brown University, told Vox via email that “she’s in charge, but she is clearly not in charge.” Hunt “defenestrated her. He is running the country. It’s like the shittiest Game of Thrones episode ever.”\n\nTruss’s tax cuts worked against her own government — and Conservative voters\n\nTruss inherited a bad economy and cost-of-living crisis from her predecessor. But “there might never have been a good time to push through tax cuts,” Nikhil Sanghani, managing director for research at the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (OMFIF), told Vox in an earlier interview.\n\nOn top of high inflation caused in part by the Covid-19 stimulus, stagnant wages, interest rate increases to combat the inflation, a weaker-than-expected economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic, and outrageous energy prices caused by Russia’s war in Ukraine amid one of the hottest summers on record, Truss’s tax plan was, he said, “the nail in the coffin in terms of, ‘Will there be a recession?’”\n\nTruss and Kwarteng proposed the policy as a way to jump-start the sluggish economy — essentially, trickle-down economics in the 21st century. But adding money to the pockets of the rich and large corporations with the assumption that they’ll use it in alignment with policy directives flies in the face of widely accepted economic theory. Moreover, injecting more money into an economy already suffering from an inflation crisis is illogical and contrary to the efforts of the Bank of England, which has raised interest rates seven times since December to help reduce the rate of inflation — now around 10 percent.\n\nTaxing income is another way to tackle inflation and provides the government with revenue to fund its programs, like pensions for the aging population and the National Health Service. Instead, the government “decide[d] to do massive tax cuts that may not be even stimulatory given that the skew on who gets the money makes the Trump tax cuts look like socialism,” Blyth said. “The people who get all the money will not spend it because they are already rich, and the people who need money to spend will get next to nothing and will then get slammed with a doubling of energy bills and a huge rise in their mortgage costs.”\n\nAlthough the government’s policy reversal seems to have rallied markets, it’s unclear what the lasting effect will be, particularly since there are so many mitigating factors like global inflation and the war in Ukraine straining the economy. It has, however, clearly highlighted that the Conservative Party is in trouble.\n\nAnd it’s not clear how the Tories will navigate that.\n\nWhat happens next with the prime minister contest — and the Conservative Party?\n\nThe future of the Conservative Party is in doubt, and its issues are a lot bigger than Truss.\n\nSome questions will be resolved in the next week. The party’s steering committee is meeting Thursday evening to hammer out the rules for the next leadership contest, and the party has promised it will all be wrapped up by October 28. (The last contest, after Johnson announced his resignation, took two months to complete.) In the final stage, Tory Party members may vote online.\n\nLikely contenders include Rishi Sunak, the former chancellor of the exchequer who went head-to-head with Truss last time; and Penny Mordaunt, another minister who was popular among her fellow conservative members of Parliament in the earlier stages of the previous contest. And though Hunt may run, and snap polling suggests that Britons approve of his decision to overturn Truss’s policies, that doesn’t mean he’s the obvious choice to replace Truss, since most voters won’t really know who he is or have had time to form an opinion on his policies.\n\nThere’s also already speculation — bolstered by calls from his allies — that Johnson may try to stage a return.\n\nBut whoever the next leader is will have to navigate longer-term questions about the Tories’ identity — and their appeal to the UK more broadly.\n\nTruss’s fall is partially of her own doing, but she was also operating within a party that‘s failed to coalesce under a united vision for the country post-Brexit. The Conservatives won their historic majority in 2019 by bringing new voters into the party. But without the unifying goal of getting Brexit done, the party has a serious issue with internal factionalization.\n\n“Conservatives are now very divided,” Goodwin said. “They have very different views on where they want to take the country. This is not like the US Republican Party that has been largely, almost completely realigned around [a] Trumpist message. This is a much more factional Conservative Party, with different wings — there’s a Boris Johnson wing, there’s a Liz Truss wing, there’s a One Nation liberal conservative wing, and that makes it difficult for the party to find a figure that everybody can agree on, to find policies that everyone can agree on.”\n\nNow public opinion is at an all-time low for Truss and her party. YouGov polls over the past nine months have put Labour firmly in the lead for the next government. After a series of mishandled crises under Tory leadership — from a rocky Brexit to former Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Covid-19 scandals and ensuing resignation to the cost-of-living and currency crises now — it seems that voters are ready to boot the Conservative Party.\n\nThe Tories have a constitutional mandate for several more years, but opposition leaders are clamoring for an early election amid this turmoil.\n\nLabour’s (also admittedly unpopular) leader Keir Starmer said his party had a platform ready to go if needed.\n\n“There’s a manifesto that is going to be ready whenever an election is called,” he said Thursday. “We’ve moved our teams onto a general election footing. And I’ve got in place all the grids I need for a general election. So we’re very, very prepared, should there be a general election.”\n\nTruss, at least, won’t be leading the Conservatives then — her unpopularity rivals that of only one other Briton, according to Goodwin. “She’s basically in what I would call Prince Andrew territory,” he said, referencing the disgraced brother of King Charles III, who was caught up in the Jeffrey Epstein scandal. “And you generally don’t tend to come back from Prince Andrew territory.”\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nJeremy Hunt reversed most mini-budget policies three weeks later.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

That process could take at least two years.\n\nBoris Johnson, the former mayor of London who campaigned for the UK’s departure from the EU, is tipped by bookmakers as Cameron’s likely successor.\n\nJohnson, who was greeted by a booing crowd when he left his home on Friday morning, thanked voters for their decision, pledged that the UK would remain committed to Europe and urged unity.\n\n“I think the electorate have searched in their hearts and answered as honestly as they can,” he said. “They have decided to vote to take back control from a European Union that has become too remote.”\n\nFormer PM: There will be costs\n\nFormer British Prime Minister Tony Blair told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer that UK voters would learn over the next 24 months that leaving Europe will not solve their economic troubles, ease their apprehensions or make Britain more independent in a meaningful way.\n\n“I literally cannot think of a big decision that I was not able to take because of Europe,” Blair said. “There is so much anger at the moment that the anger replaces the more rational answers.”\n\nBlair noted that the United States was facing the same type of political fracturing, brought on by economic turmoil, globalization and anger at immigration.\n\n“Getting out of Europe is not the answer,” he said, noting the UK sells half of its goods and services to the EU. “We are going to have to negotiate ourselves back into that market and it will be much more difficult than these people understand.”\n\nPossible Scottish independence vote\n\nIn Scotland, where support was overwhelmingly in favor of remaining in the EU, Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s First Minister and leader of the dominant Scottish National Party, said the outcome threw into doubt the future of her country’s place in the UK.\n\nShe said the Scottish government will begin preparing legislation for a new independence referendum if the Scottish Parliament decides it wants to hold one. Scots voted down a bid for independence from the UK in 2014.\n\n“Democratically unacceptable,” said Sturgeon in describing the fact that Scotland would be pulled out of the European Union despite the majority of the Scottish people voting to stay in.\n\nMORE: What does Brexit mean for you?\n\nSinn Fein calls for Irish unity\n\nThe Sinn Féin party in Northern Ireland called for a referendum on Irish unity, which could take Northern Ireland out of the UK and join it with the Republic of Ireland, an EU member.\n\nVoters in Northern Ireland voted for the UK to remain in the EU.\n\nSinn Féin President Gerry Adams said the Brexit result could portend tougher border rules – with barriers and custom posts – between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, because it will be the only land border between the EU and the UK.\n\nAdams said such a result would be unacceptable given the vote result in Northern Ireland and could undermine the cooperative relationships and that have developed between the two Irelands since the Good Friday agreement.\n\n“My issue is the north of Ireland is going to be dragged out of the EU on the decision made by people on another island,” said Adams, whose political party is dedicated to the reunification of Ireland.\n\n“We’re calling for a poll, a referendum, on Irish unity, on the border. This (the Brexit vote) has the potential to set back the good work that’s been done in terms of the peace process, building harmony, building infrastructure.”\n\n‘Dying’ institution\n\nAs European leaders faced their own crises, German Chancellor Angela Merkel stressed the “need to make sure that European people feel that the EU wants to improve all our lives.”\n\nShe said she greatly regretted the UK’s decision, but added, “The EU is strong enough to find the right answers today.”\n\nFrench President Francois Hollande called it a “painful choice which I deeply regret for the UK and Europe.”\n\nItaly’s finance minister, Pier Carlo Padoan, warned of a domino effect amid calls for further exit votes.\n\nFar-right Dutch politician Geert Wilders congratulated the UK on its decision and called for a Dutch referendum on EU membership.\n\n“We want to be in charge of our own country, our own money, our own borders and our own immigration policy,” he was quoted as saying in a statement on his website.\n\nMarine Le Pen, the leader of France’s National Front party who plans to run for the French presidency next year, also congratulated the Brexit side.\n\nHer party has suggested the French will also hold an “out” referendum if she assumes the presidency.\n\nPassions continued to run high in the UK in the hours after the vote, with UK Independence Party (UKIP) leader and Leave campaigner Nigel Farage declaring the EU a “dying” institution.\n\n“We’ve given ourselves the chance to rejoin the world,” he told journalists. “June 23rd needs to become a national bank holiday and we will call it Independence Day.”\n\nU.S. President Barack Obama said that while the UK’s relationship with Europe was changing, the ties that bound the UK to the United States and the United States to Europe would remain.\n\n“I do think yesterday’s vote speaks to ongoing changes and challenges that are raised by globalization, but the UK’s relationship with the EU will change. What will not change is the special relationship that exists between our two nations,” Obama said. “That will endure. And the EU will remain one of our indispensable partners.”\n\nMORE: Full coverage of the UK referendum\n\nNATO: UK will stay a strong ally\n\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg voiced reassurances that the United Kingdom will remain a strong and committed NATO ally despite the vote.\n\n“Today, as we face more instability and uncertainty, NATO is more important than ever as a platform for cooperation among European allies and between Europe and North America,” said Stoltenberg. “A strong, united and determined NATO remains an essential pillar of stability in a turbulent world and a key contributor to international peace and security.”\n\nVoters react\n\nThe referendum followed one of the most divisive political campaigns in recent memory. Polls consistently showed voters split down the middle, with the outcome too close to call ahead of the vote.\n\nNews of the decision sparked strong emotions, with those in favor and those against reflecting on a campaign marred by allegations of lies, distrust and hate.\n\n“This is so sad,” said Daniel Trilling on Twitter. “Millions of people aren’t going to feel any more in control of their lives or their country because of this vote.”\n\n“People vote on emotion,” Twitter user @cemanthe posted. “This was won on false promises and emotive texts about immigration. Not on facts.”\n\n“I am SO happy this morning,” wrote another, Gemma.\n\nAn online petition calling for a second referendum gathered more than 120,000 signatures within hours of being posted.\n\nLeading political figures gave mixed reactions.\n\nTony Blair, the former UK prime minister, called the decision a divided result.\n\n“It’s going to be a complicated process but it’s important to bring our country together and stabilize our country,” he told CNN’s Becky Anderson. “It’s still a resilient country and it’s a strong country.”\n\nSadiq Khan, the mayor of largely pro-EU London, said the decision was a “clear message” and urged calm.\n\n‘Taking back control’\n\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk said the decision was “historic, but not a moment for hysterical reactions.”\n\nDonald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee in the U.S. presidential election, hailed the UK’s decision to “reassert control over their own politics, borders and economy.”\n\nIn a news conference Friday as he attended the official opening of a remodeled golf resort bearing his name in Turnberry, Scotland, Trump called the decision of the voters “a great thing.”\n\n“They’re angry over borders, they’re angry over people coming into the country and taking over. Nobody even knows who they are,” he said. “They’re angry about many, many things. They took back control of their country.”\n\nUKIP’s Farage told CNN’s Nima Elbagir that the economic fears in the wake of the EU departure were overstated, and that he expected an even better relationship with the United States. He said the vote was a repudiation of bullying tactics by corporate and political powers to keep the UK in the EU.\n\n“(We were) threatened by everybody that if we didn’t stay part of this political union, dreadful things would happen to us, and what happened were the little people, the regular people, the ordinary people said, ‘No, this is wrong,’” Farage said.\n\n“When you really think about it, what we’ve done isn’t actually that radical. … We want to be a democratic nation. We want to make our own laws in our own parliament, have our own supreme court, and control our own border. If you think about, there’s now 183 countries around the world that have independence days. What we did yesterday was become 184th.”\n\nOpinion: Why Brexit vote should worry Trump\n\nMarkets plunge\n\nThe effects of the vote outcome were immediately felt in markets and economies around the world.\n\nIn New York, the Dow ended the day down more than 611 points, to close at 17,399. London’s FTSE index shed $164 billion of its value in the first 10 minutes of trading, but regained ground later in the day.\n\nThe NASDAQ index fell more than 4% and into a correction, or down 10% from recent highs.\n\nThe British pound at one point plunged more than 12% to below $1.34, its lowest level since 1985. Japan’s Nikkei tanked 6.7% and Hong Kong’s main index dropped 3.7%.\n\nBank of England Governor Mark Carney said the body is “well prepared” and “won’t hesitate” to take additional measures as markets adjust.\n\nThe “UK financial system is resilient,” he added.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nThe British pound plunged in value.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

The reality is that mRNA technology remains under-tested, and we are not going to spend taxpayer dollars repeating the mistakes of the last administration, which concealed legitimate safety concerns from the public,\" Nixon said.\n\nHe added that \"the move signals a shift in federal vaccine funding priorities toward platforms with better-established safety profiles and transparent data practices. HHS remains committed to advancing pandemic preparedness through technologies that are evidence-based, ethically grounded, and publicly accountable.\" The official did not provide any additional details.\n\nJennifer Nuzzo, the director of Brown University's Pandemic Center, said the decision was \"disappointing, but unsurprising given the politically-motivated, evidence-free rhetoric that tries to paint mRNA vaccines as being dangerous.\"\n\n\"While there are other means of making flu vaccines in a pandemic, they are slower and some rely on eggs, which may be in short supply,\" Nuzzo added in an email. \"What we learned clearly during the last influenza pandemic is there are only a few companies in the world that make flu vaccines, which means in a pandemic there won't be enough to go around. If the U.S. wants to make sure it can get enough vaccines for every American who wants them during a pandemic, it should invest in multiple types of vaccines instead of putting all of our eggs in one basket.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe cancellation comes even though Moderna says a study involving 300 healthy adults had produced \"positive interim\" results and the company \"had previously expected to advance the program to late-stage development.\"\n\n\"While the termination of funding from HHS adds uncertainty, we are pleased by the robust immune response and safety profile observed in this interim analysis of the Phase 1/2 study of our H5 avian flu vaccine and we will explore alternative paths forward for the program,\" Stéphane Bancel, Moderna's chief executive officer, said in a statement. \"These clinical data in pandemic influenza underscore the critical role mRNA technology has played as a countermeasure to emerging health threats.\"\n\nThe administration's move drew sharp criticism from outside experts.\n\n\"This decision puts the lives and health of the American people at risk,\" said Dr. Ashish Jha, the dean of the Brown School of Public Health, who served as President Biden's COVID-19 response coordinator.\n\n\"Bird Flu is a well known threat and the virus has continued to evolve. If the virus develops the ability to spread from person to person, we could see a large number of people get sick and die from this infection,\" Jha said. \"The program to develop the next generation of vaccines was essential to protecting Americans. The attack by the Administration on the mRNA vaccine platform is absurd.\"\n\nMichael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, agreed.\n\n\"This decision will make our country far less prepared to respond to the next influenza pandemic,\" he said in an email. \"This is a dangerous course to follow.\"\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the H5N1 flu virus has spread to 1,072 dairy herds, more than 173 million poultry, and caused 70 human cases. While the virus has had a high mortality rate in other countries, so far H5N1 has only caused one death in the U.S. and has not shown any signs of spreading easily from one person to another. But infectious disease experts are concerned that the more the virus spreads, the greater the chance it could mutate into a form that would spread from person to person, which would increase the risk of a pandemic.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nThe Iranian government issued an intercity travel ban and closed schools, universities, national parks, and non-essential businesses on March 26.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

In the next three years, Huawei, the world’s second largest smartphone vendor, will look to bring HarmonyOS to more devices, including smartphones, he said.\n\nYu said, without offering any proof, that HarmonyOS is “more powerful and secure than Android.” He said HarmonyOS’ IPC performance is five times that of Google’s Fuchsia. The top executive also claimed that HarmonyOS’ microkernel has “one-thousandth the amount of code in the Linux kernel.”\n\n“A modularized HarmonyOS can be nested to adapt flexibly to any device to create a seamless cross-device experience. Developed via the distributed capability kit, it builds the foundation of a shared developer ecosystem,” the company said in a statement, adding that it began to explore developing its own operating system “as early as 10 years ago.”\n\nThe company said it intends to continue to use Android moving forward, but HarmonyOS is officially its back-up plan if things go south. “We will prioritize Android for smartphones, but if we can’t use Android, we will be able to install HarmonyOS quickly,” Yu said.\n\nThe availability of the mobile operating system, which is open source, will be limited to China for now, though the company has plans to bring it to international markets at a later stage, he said.\n\nThe company said it has worked on security and trustworthiness aspects of the operating system from the ground up. It said HarmonyOS uses formal verification methods to “reshape security.” Formal verification methods are an effective mathematical approach to validate system correctness from the source, while traditional verification methods, such as functional verification and attack simulation, “are confined to limited scenarios,” the company claimed.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $475 on your TechCrunch All Stage pass Build smarter.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\n\nThe announcement today comes months after the U.S. government put Huawei and more than 60 affiliates in an entity list, restricting U.S. firms from maintaining a business relationship with the Chinese giant. The U.S. government has accused Huawei of stealing trade secrets, and said it poses a risk to national security. Huawei has denied these accusations and pursued legal means to fight back.\n\nIn the aftermath, Google, Intel and other U.S.-based companies that contribute much of the technology and solutions that go into a smartphone suspended their business with Huawei, thereby severely questioning the company’s future prospects.\n\nThe ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China has already started to impact Huawei’s bottom line. The company’s performance in the quarter that ended in June was weak, compared to several previous quarters.\n\nWhat remains unclear is the kind of impact the U.S.’ accusations have had on the Chinese giant’s brand image worldwide. According to research firm Counterpoint, about half of all Huawei smartphones ship outside China.\n\nHuawei was poised to become the world’s biggest vendor by shipment — something it would have achieved — “if not for the trade war,” Yu said.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nHuawei announced a deployment timeline for HarmonyOS on various devices between 2020 and 2022.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Japan is the first country that was attacked with an atomic bomb in the world, and the prime minister of the country made this decision,\" said Kenichi Sato, 68.\n\nMultiple meltdowns\n\nWith around 1,000 steel containers holding the water, TEPCO has said it needs to clear space for the removal of highly dangerous radioactive nuclear fuel and rubble from the wrecked reactors.\n\nThree of the reactors at the Fukushima-Daiichi facility in northeastern Japan went into meltdown following a massive earthquake and tsunami that killed around 18,000 people in 2011.\n\nSince then, TEPCO has collected 1.34 million cubic metres of water that was contaminated as it cooled the wrecked reactors, along with groundwater and rain that has seeped in.\n\nTEPCO will carry out four releases of the treated water from Thursday until March 2024. The first will last about 17 days, though it is expected to take around 30 years for all of the wastewater to be discharged.\n\nJapan says that all radioactive elements have been filtered out except the tritium, levels of which are harmless and lower than what is discharged by operational nuclear power plants -- including in China.\n\nThis is backed by most experts.\n\n\"When released into the Pacific, the tritium is further diluted into a vast body of water and would quickly get to a radioactivity level which is not discernibly different from normal seawater,\" said Tom Scott from the University of Bristol.\n\nSushi safety\n\nNot everyone is convinced, with environmental group Greenpeace saying that the filtration process is flawed, and China and Russia suggesting the water be vaporised and released into the atmosphere instead.\n\nChina has accused Japan of treating the Pacific like a \"sewer\", and even before the release, Beijing banned food imports from 10 out of 47 Japanese prefectures and imposed radiation checks.\n\nHong Kong and Macau, both Chinese territories, followed suit this week.\n\nRestaurants in Beijing and Hong Kong serving sushi and sashimi are already reeling from the restrictions.\n\n\"About 80 percent of the seafood products we use come from Japan,\" Hong Kong caterer Jasy Choi, who runs a small kitchen for takeaway Japanese food, told AFP.\n\nAnalysts said that while China may have genuine safety concerns, its strong reaction is also motivated at least in part by its economic rivalry and frosty relations with Japan.\n\nThe South Korean government, which is seeking to improve ties with Japan, has not objected, although many ordinary people are worried and have staged protests.\n\nSocial media posts in China and South Korea have included false claims about the release, including doctored images of deformed fish with claims they were linked to Fukushima.\n\nPeople in the Japanese fishing industry oppose the release, worrying that governments and consumers will shun their seafood.\n\n\"I am worried about the future,\" protestor Ruiko Muto, 70, told AFP in Miharu near the power plant.\n\n\"We can't pass on the responsibility of what happened during our generation to the generation of our children and to future generations.\"\n\n(AFP)\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nThe Chinese government criticized Japan’s plan to release wastewater.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

It is the latest chapter in the country's nearly 42 years of instability and bitter conflict.\n\nAfghans have lived through foreign invasions, civil war, insurgency and a previous period of oppressive Taliban rule. Here are some key events and dates from the past four decades.\n\nThe Soviet war years\n\nDecember 1979\n\nFollowing upheaval after a 1978 Afghan coup, the Soviet military invades Afghanistan to prop up a pro-Soviet government.\n\n1980\n\nBabrak Karmal is installed as Afghanistan's Soviet-backed ruler.

Groups in China and South Korea have also raised concern, making it a political and diplomatic issue.\n\nBut the Japanese government and TEPCO say the water must be released to make room for the plant's decommissioning and to prevent accidental leaks. They say the treatment and dilution will make the wastewater safer than international standards and its environmental impact will be negligibly small. But some scientists say long-term impact of the low-dose radioactivity that remains in the water needs attention.\n\nThe water release begins more than 12 years after the March 2011 nuclear meltdowns, caused by a massive earthquake and tsunami. It marks a milestone for the plant's battle with an ever-growing radioactive water stockpile that TEPCO and the government say have hampered the daunting task of removing the fatally toxic melted debris from the reactors.\n\nThe pump activated Thursday afternoon would send the first batch of the diluted, treated water from a mixing pool to a secondary pool, where the water is then discharged into the ocean through an undersea tunnel. The water is collected and partly recycled as cooling water after treatment, with the rest stored in around 1,000 tanks, which are already filled to 98% of their 1.37-million-ton capacity.\n\nThose tanks, which cover much of the plant complex, must be freed up to build the new facilities needed for the decommissioning process, officials said.\n\nPrime Minister Fumio Kishida said it is indispensable and and cannot be postponed. He noted an experimental removal of a small amount of the melted debris from the No. 2 reactor is set for later this year using a remote-controlled giant robotic arm.\n\nTEPCO executive Junichi Matsumoto said Thursday's release was to begin with the least radioactive water to ensure safety.\n\nFinal preparation for the release began Tuesday, when just one ton of treated water was sent from a tank for dilution with 1,200 tons of seawater, and the mixture was kept in the primary pool for two days for final sampling to ensure safety, Matsumoto said. A batch of 460 tons was to be sent to the mixing pool Thursday for the actual discharge.\n\nBut Fukushima's fisheries, tourism and economy — which are still recovering from the disaster — worry the release could be the beginning of a new hardship.\n\nFukushima's current fish catch is only about one-fifth its pre-disaster level, in part due to a decline in the fishing population. China has tightened radiation testing on Japanese products from Fukushima and nine other prefectures, halting exports at customs for weeks, Fisheries Agency officials said.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nA TEPCO staff member activated a seawater pump and an operator confirmed the release.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

This column by former Mayor John Norquist, originally published in February of last year, explains why this would damage Wisconsin manufacturing.\n\nThe problem with imposing tariffs is that the most likely imports to be restricted are products Wisconsin needs and doesn’t manufacture.\n\nFor example, consider the American steel industry. For decades it has relentlessly lobbied the federal government to impose tariffs and quotas on its international competition. What happens if higher steel tariffs are imposed? The effect would vary from state to state. Indiana produces more steel than any other state. So even though Indiana has many more jobs devoted to making finished products from steel, it does actually make steel and at least its steel producers could raise prices and therefore financially benefit from restrictions on imports of steel. Of course the Indiana businesses buying steel would pay higher prices; so high that their customers might not stay with them. Wisconsin, by contrast, has no steel mills, but has a large base of manufacturers who make finished steel products. So a Trump tariff on steel would be painful to the Wisconsin economy.\n\nPresident Trump repeatedly attacks trade as a threat to American jobs. His rhetoric has been almost purely protectionist since first announcing his campaign. Blaming foreigners for job losses resonates with many Americans especially when supporters of trade are quiet. Arguments for trade seem complicated and are difficult to make in the heat of elections. Of course Trump is not the only one to warn against trade.did it.changed her pro-trade position during the campaign. Almost no prominent politicians make the case anymore for free tradeand Rep.(R- Janesville) have been exceptions to the rule.\n\nThe spread of trade fear usually originates with older industries that are in decline, often for reasons that have less to do with trade than with industries clinging to outmoded business practices or technology. The raw metal, textile and maritime industries are examples of businesses that continually lobby for protection from foreign competitors. But probably the most obsessed lobbyist has been the steel industry. Author James Bovard in his book Fair Trade Fraud describes the industry’s intense tactics to gain tariff protection; How the steel manufacturers involve themselves in campaigns and full court lobbying of Congress. Instead of trying to serve their customers they push for help to raise prices on them.\n\nIf you read the steel industry’s press releases they always claim to be on the verge of extinction, victims of economic warfare waged against the U.S. by “enemies” such as Japan, France, the UK, Sweden, Brazil and sometimes even Canada. This despite the fact that the proportion of steel consumed in the U.S. that is also made in the U.S. has not dropped below 60 percent since the 19th century. Steel is heavy and it’s expensive to ship overseas which acts like a natural tariff on steel.\n\nThe Steel Lobby has had success at establishing some tariffs and quotas. They may be about to gain much more. Trump named steel industry lobbyist Robert Lighthizer as U.S. Trade Representative. And when campaigning in Ohio and Pennsylvania Trump repeatedly indicated he’ll seek trade protection for US steel producers. This is bad news for Milwaukee manufacturers who use steel to make valuable products, including Master Lock, Harley Davidson and Briggs and Stratton. Steel is not made in Wisconsin so raising its price will only hurt the many manufacturers here who buy it. Tariffs will also raise prices for construction including that of state and local government for streets, roads, buildings and bridges. Will anyone speak out? Will Wisconsin’s Congressional delegation stand up for the interests of the private and public sector in the state, who will both be hurt?\n\nThe issue will be hard to take on because in the 2016 election almost no one defended trade. Trump and Sanders blamed trade for US job losses even though job growth has been sustained in every month since January 2010. Clinton backed off from her defense of trade early in her battle with Sanders. With Trump’s victory and his appointment of Lighthizer, higher duties on steel may be just around the corner.\n\nHouse Speaker Ryan and Western Wisconsin Congressman Ron Kind ( D- La Crosse) have a history of supporting free trade. Will they adhere to their position and if they do will others follow? Democratic Congressional representatives Gwen Moore of Milwaukee and Madison’s Mark Pocan will likely be pressured by organized labor to support tariffs even if the tariffs hurt Wisconsin. And Republican Congressmen will feel pressure to side with their Republican President. None of this pressure will be sympathetic to the negative effect of trade barriers on Wisconsin manufacturers. Moore should consider that steel tariffs will not only hurt Milwaukee businesses, but also the Port of Milwaukee. One of the most profitable operations at the Port handles imported steel.\n\nWe’ve seen this scenario before. In March 2002 the George W. Bush administration imposed tariffs that averaged 30 percent on steel produced in Norway, Switzerland, Japan, South Korea and the European Community. Manufacturers who buy and use steel complained, pointing out that there are 57 jobs making products from steel for every job making steel itself. Those jobs are at risk, they said, “if users have to pay more for steel and raise prices,” because the finished goods made in America will be less competitive. During the 2000 Presidential campaign Bush promised protection to steel makers in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia and as Bloomberg reported, Bush’s team felt boxed in by their promises and so levied the tariffs.\n\nSeveral companies, including Milwaukee Wrought Washer and Milwaukee Paper Machinery, were forced to suspend some of their operations when they lost access to steel they needed from overseas. The problem wasn’t just price, but availability, as foreign steel makers couldn’t ship product until they knew it could be legally delivered. Milwaukee Paper Machinery, which exports equipment that makes food and drink containers, uses some alloys of high-grade steel that aren’t even made in America. They had to get it from Finland and the Finns couldn’t send it while the Bush’s trade restrictions were pending. Without the steel they were forced to suspend much of their production. Milwaukee Wrought Washer similarly was forced to lay off workers, who were ironically enough represented by the United Steelworkers Union, which at the national level supported the restrictions that cost their Milwaukee members work. As the Milwaukee Business Journal reported, the price hikes induced by the Bush tariff hit many Wisconsin businesses hard. “It’s ridiculous,” said Irv Palmer , president of Manutec Inc., a steel fabricator at 2475 W. Hampton Ave., Milwaukee. “ We just can’t believe the increases we are seeing. There’s some gouging going on .”\n\nPresident Bush’s move ultimately damaged relations with international trade partners, contributed to a temporary domestic steel shortage and allowed U.S. producers to ramp up their prices to the detriment of American businesses that rely on steel, according to a 2003 study by Laura Baughman and Dr. Joseph Francois of the Trade Partnership Worldwide economic consulting group. After a year and a half of facing intense domestic and international pressure, Bush came to the right conclusion and lowered the tariffs.\n\nPresident Trump used trade to help win the Presidency and soon his actions may cause Wisconsin manufacturers and their workers to lose market share. Let’s hope Wisconsin’s delegation defends Wisconsin and the nation’s interests by opposing trade protection.\n\nJohn Norquist served as Mayor of Milwaukee from 1988 to 2004.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nPresident Donald Trump proposed tariffs on steel and aluminum.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said Tuesday that the release of more than 1 million metric tons of wastewater — equivalent to more than 500 Olympic-size swimming pools — will take place in a safe manner.\n\n“We expect the discharge to begin on Aug. 24 if weather and sea conditions do not hinder it,” Kishida said after a cabinet meeting in Tokyo, asking the plant’s operator, Tokyo Electric Power Co., to prepare for the release.\n\nJapan said it will send treated radioactive water from Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant into the Pacific Ocean on Aug. 24, despite local and global opposition. (Video: Naomi Schanen/The Washington Post)\n\nAfter a two-year review, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) concluded last month that Japan’s plan meets international safety standards and would have “negligible” radiological impact on people and the environment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“The government is committed to taking full responsibility until the disposal of the treated water is completed, even if it takes decades to complete,” Kishida said Tuesday.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe water, filtered to remove radioactive elements and highly diluted to lower the concentration of tritium, will be released into the Pacific Ocean in a process expected to take more than 30 years. The concentration of tritium, a radioactive material that is extremely difficult to separate from water, will drop to background ocean levels after the dilution, Japanese authorities say.\n\nFor years, the contaminated water has been stored in large metal tanks near the plant, the site of one of the worst nuclear disasters in history. But Japan is running out of space to build more tanks to accommodate the contaminated groundwater and rainwater that are still exiting the site.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStarting Thursday, the treated water will be discharged at a maximum rate of 132,000 gallons a day through an underwater tunnel off the coast of Japan. External observers, including the IAEA, will monitor the release process.\n\nThe IAEA said Tuesday that it will maintain “its impartial, independent, and objective safety review during the discharge phase.” The agency, which has an office at the plant, said it will continue to assess the relevant activities and publish independent data.\n\nDespite such assurances, environmental groups have questioned the safety of releasing the contaminated water and urged Tokyo to drop the plan.\n\n“Instead of engaging in an honest debate about this reality, the Japanese government has opted for a false solution — decades of deliberate radioactive pollution of the marine environment — during a time when the world’s oceans are already facing immense stress and pressures,” said Shaun Burnie, senior nuclear specialist at Greenpeace East Asia.\n\nThe pending discharge has been highly politicized by neighboring countries. China has been adamantly opposed to the release, which comes at a time of heightened geopolitical tensions between Tokyo and Beijing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“China has pointed out on many occasions that ocean discharge is not the safest or most prudent option to dispose of the nuclear-contaminated water. Japan simply chose it to lower economic costs,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said Monday. “This will pose unnecessary risks to neighboring countries and the rest of the world,” he said, urging Japan to call off the plan.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe plan has also ignited debates in South Korea, which has banned seafood imports from the Fukushima area, even though South Korea’s own assessment of the water-release plan also found it meets international standards.\n\nA senior South Korean government official said Tuesday that Seoul does not necessarily support Japan’s wastewater plan but sees “no scientific or technical problems.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“If the actual discharge deviates from the plan, even just a little bit, we will deem it a threat to the safety and health of our people, and immediately ask Japan to stop,” said Park Gu-yeon, vice minister of government policy coordination.\n\nBut opposition politicians have raised concerns that South Korean waters may be affected by the release, accusing President Yoon Suk Yeol of overlooking the health risks to mend diplomatic ties with Tokyo.\n\n“The Yoon Suk Yeol administration is turning a blind eye to Japan’s dumping of nuclear-contaminated water into the sea,” said Kang Sun-woo, a spokeswoman for the main opposition Democratic Party.\n\nFukushima’s fishing and agricultural industries are also worried about potential reputational harm for their products, which still carry the stigma of radioactive exposure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Our position has not changed and we continue to be opposed,” Masanobu Sakamoto, head of the National Federation of Fisheries Cooperative Associations, said Monday after meeting with Kishida.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n“Our understanding about the safety of the treated water has deepened, but scientific safety and safety from a social point is different. Once the water is released, there will be reputational damage,” he said.\n\nFishing season in Fukushima is due to start Sept. 1, and the Japanese government has pledged to monitor the water quality and collect data every day following the release.\n\nIn Tokyo, about 230 people gathered in front of the prime minister’s office Tuesday to protest the plan, holding signs and chanting slogans such as “Listen to the fishermen” and “The release will impact future generations.”\n\nAccording to a recent Kyodo News poll, 88.1 percent of respondents expressed concern that the release will hurt Japan’s image abroad. The Japanese government has said it will allocate $200 million to compensate the fishing industry for any reputational impact, and $340 million to mitigate the impact on the local economy.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nPrime Minister Fumio Kishida announced Japan would begin discharging treated radioactive water from the Fukushima Daiichi plant into the sea as early as Thursday.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

The AI chatbot has had a far-reaching impact on how we work and study.\n\nChatGPT has made it much simpler to manage complex tasks like crafting and editing articles or creating nutrition plans. The chatbot can deliver results in seconds. ChatGPT can even generate detailed construction plans or computer programs in a matter of minutes — assignments that take architects and coders many weeks of hard work.\n\nWhen US tech company OpenAI launched ChatGPT one year ago on November 30, 2022, it sparked a veritable revolution. The chatbot uses machine learning and was trained on a massive body of text data. It has since been programmed to search the internet for pictures and documents after receiving a query.\n\nMillions of people started using ChatGPT immediately after its launch, according to OpenAI. Now, one year later, even more have made use of the platform.\n\nIn August alone, the ChatGPT website received some 1.43 billion visits, according to Similarweb, an online traffic analyst. These days, however, many users tap into ChatGPT's neural network via other apps instead of through its dedicated website. The total number of ChatGPT users is therefore likely to be significantly higher.\n\nHow will ChatGPT impact the labor market?\n\nChatGPT will likely have a direct impact on the world of work. Investment bank Goldman Sachs for instance estimates that artificial intelligence (AI) systems such as ChatGPT could lead to the automation of up to 300 million jobs worldwide. Academic and creative professions would be most affected.\n\nThe dark side of the shiny AI tool ChatGPT To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nAnd while this may sound like bad news, it does not have to be. While Goldman Sachs says the \"impact of AI on the labor market is likely to be significant, most jobs and industries are only partially exposed to automation and are thus more likely to be complemented rather than substituted by AI.\"\n\nDaniel, a software developer employed by a large corporation, agrees with this optimistic assessment. He does not want to reveal his full name, however, citing competition among tech companies.\n\n\"You can't give a detailed programming assignment [to ChatGPT] and expect perfect results,\" Daniel told DW. \"It works best for me if I take ChatGPT's answers as a suggestion and then continue to build on that to create something better in dialogue with the AI platform.\"\n\nAnd so far, ChatGPT results are not always reliable. Even if they can look convincing at first glance, they sometimes amount to utter nonsense. OpenAI has said it plans to iron out such AI \"hallucinations\" in the next one to two years.\n\nSome tech experts, however, doubt such \"hallucinations\" will ever disappear. This means if individuals use ChatGPT to answer very important questions, they should carefully check the results.\n\nGerman international broadcaster DW is also experimenting with AI. But \"generative AI will not replace the work of our journalists,\" according to DW Editor-in-Chief Manuela Kasper-Claridge.\n\nWhat about plagiarism?\n\nUniversities are somewhat concerned about ChatGPT and the risk of plagiarism. German universities, for example, have not yet established a set of common rules for dealing with ChatGPT-generated material.\n\n\"While there is consensus that the use of such tools should not be banned, a critical approach should be encouraged,\" Martin Wan of the German Rector's Conference's digitalization unit told DW. \"In terms of academic integrity, this includes being transparent about the use of such tools and not passing off ChatGPT-generated texts as one's own work.\"\n\nMartin Wan says academics should be cautious about how they use ChatGPT Image: Jürgen Schulzki\n\nWan says while one may use such system to \"compile the latest research findings\" one should bear in mind they are still \"hallucinating\" and should be cautious about AI-generated content.\n\nIt therefore seems unlikely that ChatGPT could be used to commit large-scale plagiarism. \"Even when AI generators provide something akin to sources, this is rarely like a scientific bibliography,\" Wan told DW. \"You realize that relatively quickly once you get into a subject.\"\n\nBut ChatGPT can also be utilized for studying. Dom, a student, told DW he primarily uses the platform to better understand complex topics. \"It's like having someone sitting next to you that you can ask. I know it's not entirely accurate, but it gives me a point of reference,\" Dom said. \"I wouldn't have passed the last exam without ChatGPT.\"\n\nIs artificial intelligence helpful or harmful?

But rumors surrounding recent changes in OpenAI's leadership, including the firing and rehiring of Sam Altman, suggest that the company is already working on a new AI system that could overshadow ChatGPT.\n\nThis article was originally written in German.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nMillions of people started using ChatGPT immediately after its launch.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

There were 28 weather and climate disasters in 2023, surpassing the previous record of 22 in 2020, tallying a price tag of at least $92.9 billion. This total annual cost may rise by several billion when we’ve fully accounted for the costs of the December 16-18 East Coast storm and flooding event that impacted states from Florida to Maine.\n\n## 2023 Highlights\n\nIn 2023, the U.S. experienced 28 separate weather and climate disasters costing at least 1 billion dollars. That number puts 2023 into first place for the highest number of billion-dollar disasters in a calendar year and included:\n\n- 1 winter storm/cold wave event (across the northeast U.S. in early-February).\n- 1 wildfire event (firestorm destroying town of Lahaina on Maui Island of Hawaii).\n- 1 drought and heat wave event (focused across the central and southern U.S.).\n- 4 flooding events (in California, Florida, and across the eastern and northeastern U.S.).\n- 2 tornado outbreaks (across the central and eastern U.S.).\n- 2 tropical cyclones (Idalia in Florida and Typhoon Mawar in Guam).\n- 17 severe weather/hail events (across many parts of the country).\n\n2023 was also deadly, causing at least 492 direct or indirect fatalities—the 8th most disaster-related fatalities for the contiguous U.S. since 1980.\n\nDamages from the 2023 disasters totaled $92.9 billion. (All cost estimates are adjusted based on the Consumer Price Index, 2023). The costliest 2023 events were the Southern / Midwestern Drought and Heat Wave ($14.5 billion) and the Southern and Eastern Severe Weather in early March ($6.0 billion). Adding the 2023 events to the record that began in 1980, the U.S. has sustained **376 weather and climate disasters** with the overall damage costs reaching or exceeding $1 billion. The cumulative cost for these 376 events exceeds **$2.660 trillion**.\n\n## 2023 costs in historical context\n\nAs with all years of the 2020s decade, 2023 was another very active year, featuring a high frequency, high cost, and large diversity of extreme events that affect people's lives and livelihoods. 2023 (red line) is the fourth consecutive year (2020-2023) in which 18 or more separate billion-dollar disaster events have impacted the U.S., marking a consistent pattern that is becoming the new normal. The 1980–2023 annual average (black line) is 8.5 events (CPI-adjusted); the annual average for the most recent 5 years (2019–2023) is 20.4 events (CPI-adjusted).\n\nOver the last seven years (2017-2023), 137 separate billion-dollar disasters have killed at least 5,500 people and cost >$1 trillion in damage. One of the drivers of this cost is that the U.S. has been impacted by landfalling Category 4 or 5 hurricanes in five of the last seven years, including Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria, Michael, Laura, Ida, and Ian. The U.S. was spared a major hurricane impacting a major metropolitan area in 2023, as Category 3 Hurricane Idalia made landfall in the less populated Big Bend region of Florida.\n\nIn broader context, the total cost of U.S. billion-dollar disasters over the last 5 years (2019-2023) is **$603.1 billion**, with a 5-year annual cost average of **$120.6 billion**, the latter of which is more than double the 44-year inflation-adjusted annual average cost. The U.S. billion-dollar disaster damage costs over the last 10-years (2014-2023) were also historically large: at least **$1.2 trillion **from 173 separate billion-dollar events.\n\nIt is important to keep in mind that these estimates do not reflect the total cost of U.S. weather and climate disasters, only those associated with events more than $1 billion in damages. That means they are **a conservative estimate** of how much extreme weather costs the United States each year. However, these billion-dollar events do account for most of the damage from all recorded U.S. weather and climate events (NCEI; Munich Re), and they are becoming an increasingly larger percentage of the total damage costs from weather-related events at all scales and loss levels.\n\nThe U.S. losses from billion-dollar disasters over the last seven years (2017-2023) are more than $1 trillion and have further skewed the total distribution of extreme weather costs. From 1980-2000, about **75%** of all disaster-related costs were due to billion-dollar disasters, and by 2010, the percentage had risen to about **80%**. By 2023, it has risen to >**85% of all disaster-related costs**, or $2.660 trillion out of $3.050 trillion.\n\n## Increasing trend of high-cost disasters: exposure, vulnerability, and climate change\n\nThe number and cost of weather and climate disasters are increasing in the United States due to a combination of increased exposure (i.e., more assets at risk), vulnerability (i.e., how much damage a hazard of given intensity—wind speed, or flood depth, for example—causes at a location), and the fact that climate change is increasing the frequency of some types of extremes that lead to billion-dollar disasters (Fifth U.S. National Climate Assessment (2023).\n\nIn other words, the increase in population and material wealth over the last several decades are an important cause for the rising costs. These trends are further complicated by the fact that much of the growth has taken place in vulnerable areas like coasts, the wildland-urban interface, and river floodplains. Vulnerability is especially high where building codes are insufficient for reducing damage from extreme events. This is part of the reason that the 2010s decade is far costlier than the 2000s, 1990s, or 1980s (all inflation adjusted to 2023 dollars).\n\nThe cost per capita (see right y-axis in chart below) is also rising for the U.S. as a whole meaning that the costs of the billion-dollar disasters is rising more sharply than general population growth. The chart shows the 5-year-average disaster cost per capita was about $150 (inflation-adjusted) per U.S. resident in the early-2000’s. The 5-year average disaster cost per capita then increased above $400 per person in the late 2010’s and has remained at a high level in recent years. The cost per capita data can also be examined at state and regional level for more detail.\n\nWe also know from research using other kinds of climate and weather data that climate change is supercharging the increasing frequency and intensity of certain types of extreme weather that lead to billion-dollar disasters—most notably the rise in vulnerability to drought, lengthening wildfire seasons in the Western states, and the potential for extremely heavy rainfall becoming more common in the eastern states. Sea level rise is worsening hurricane storm surge flooding. (Read more about changes in climate and weather extremes in the Fifth U.S. National Climate Assessment (2023)__.__ Given those trends, it’s likely that human-caused climate change is having an influence on the rising costs of billion-dollar disasters.\n\nGiven all these compounding hazard risks, there is an increased need to focus on where we build, how we build, and investing in infrastructure updates that are designed for a 21st-century climate.\n\n## Notable U.S. billion-dollar disasters of 2023\n\nAmong the many weather and climate-related disasters to affect the U.S. in 2023, the following caused the most damaging impacts and heavily impacted many communities:\n\n### Southern / Midwestern Drought and Heat Wave: 247 deaths, $14.5 billion\n\nDrought conditions impacted numerous Southern and Midwestern states. The agriculture sector in this particular area was also impacted, including damage to field crops from lack of rainfall and heat. Ranchers were forced to sell-off livestock early in some regions due to high feeding costs.\n\nFor the second straight year, portions of the Mississippi River experienced record-low water levels impacting river commerce. This also allowed salt water from the Gulf of Mexico to migrate northward, along the bottom of the Mississippi River, impacting water quality in southern Louisiana.\n\n### Central Tornado Outbreak and Eastern Severe Weather in early March 31-April 1: 33 deaths, $5.7 billion\n\nA destructive tornado outbreak on March 31 produced over 150 preliminary tornadoes across many southern and central states. This was the largest outbreak in a 24-hour period for the month of March. The surveyed tornado ratings so far include: 41 EF-0, 41 EF-1, 33 EF-2, 11 EF-3, and 1 EF-4 tornado. The strongest tornado from this event occurred in Keota, Iowa and was rated an EF-4 with maximum wind speeds of 170 mph (274 kph). Damage surveys pinpointed significant damage in parts of western Little Rock, Arkansas as an EF-3 injured 54 and led to one fatality in Pulaski County. Another EF-3 tornado injured 26 near Wayne, Tennessee while an EF-3 tornado near Covington, Tennessee injured 28 and led to four fatalities. In addition, large hail and damaging winds spread a swath of damage from Texas to Ohio impacting homes, vehicles, businesses, government buildings and infrastructure. In total, there were more than 20 fatalities and more than 200 injuries reported during this tornado outbreak.\n\n### Hawaii firestorm, August 8: 100 deaths, $5.6 billion\n\nIn the contiguous U.S., the 2023 Western wildfire season was below average, but Canada and the island of Maui in Hawaii suffered unprecedented wildfire impacts and damage. On Maui, the deadliest wildfire in the U.S. in over a century devastated the historic town of Lahaina. Winds from Hurricane Dora exacerbated the wildfire as it rapidly spread, destroying thousands of homes, vehicles and businesses in its path.\n\n## 1980-2023 costs and fatalities by disaster type\n\nThe distribution of damage from U.S. billion-dollar disaster events from 1980 to 2023 is dominated by tropical cyclone losses. Tropical cyclones have caused the most damage ($1,379.3 billion) and have the highest average event cost ($22.2 billion per event). Severe storms ($455.2 billion), drought ($352.9 billion),and inland flooding ($196.6 billion) have also caused considerable damage based on the list of billion-dollar events.\n\nSevere storms have caused the highest *number *of billion-dollar disaster events (186), but they have the lowest average event cost ($2.4 billion), not surprising given their localized nature. Tropical cyclones and flooding represent the second and third most frequent event types (62 and 44), respectively. Tropical cyclones are responsible for the highest number of deaths (6,897), followed by drought/heatwave events (4,522) and severe storms (2,094).\n\nIn 2016-2018, the U.S. was impacted by 6 separate billion-dollar hurricanes (i.e., Matthew, Harvey, Irma, Maria, Florence, Michael) with 3,318 fatalities and an inflation-adjusted loss total of $400.8 billion. As a comparison, the U.S. also experienced a series of active hurricane seasons from 2003-2005 where 9 separate billion-dollar hurricanes (including Katrina, Rita, and Wilma in 2005) made landfall, with 2,225 fatalities and an inflation-adjusted loss total of $352.9 billion.\n\n## Climatology of billion-dollar disasters\n\n### Disasters by region\n\nThe South, Central and Southeast regions of the United States, including the Caribbean U.S. territories, have suffered the highest cumulative damage costs, reflecting the severity and widespread vulnerability of those regions to a variety of weather and climate events.\n\nIn addition to the highest number of billion-dollar disasters experienced, __Texas also leads the U.S. in total cumulative costs__ (~$**402 billion**) from billion-dollar disasters since 1980. __Florida is the second-leading state__ in total costs since 1980 (~**$389 billion**), largely the result of destructive hurricane impacts. Louisiana’s total costs are the 3rd highest (~$**304 billion**) from billion-dollar disasters.\n\nThe map above shows how the impact of the 2023 Southern and Central Drought combined with the many severe storm events caused more than one dozen states to have $2-5 billion in damage costs EACH. The costliest hazard overall was severe storm events with $54.0 billion in damage. Dozens of states across the nation sustained relatively high levels of damage from hail, derechos and tornadoes. Four separate billion-dollar flood events also were impactful across California, Florida and the Northeast.\n\n### Billion-dollar disasters by month\n\nThe 44-year climatology of U.S. billion-dollar disasters offers a view of risk from extreme events, which are often seasonal in nature. For example, during the spring months (March-May) severe storms (green blocks), including tornadoes, hail, and high winds, often occur in many Central and Southeast states, but they taper off in the second half of the year. During the spring months there is also greater potential for major river flooding (i.e., deep blue events in chart above). U.S. springtime flooding from snowmelt and/or heavy rainfall is a persistent hazard that affects many towns and agriculture regions within the Missouri and Mississippi River basins, among others. During the fall season, Gulf and Atlantic coast states must be vigilant about hurricane season particularly during August and September (i.e., yellow events in chart above).\n\nAlso, the peak of the Western U.S. wildfire season occurs during the fall months of September, October and November (i.e., orange events in chart above). California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana and Colorado often experience enhanced wildfire risk and related poor air quality for weeks to months. Western wildfire risk is also becoming more hazardous, as 17 of the 20 largest California wildfires by acreage and 18 of the 20 most destructive wildfires by number of buildings destroyed have occurred since the year 2000. In four of the last seven years (2017, 2018, 2020 and 2021), California has experienced historically large and costly wildfires, with losses well exceeding $70.0 billion.\n\nIn total, each region of the U.S. faces a unique combination of recurring hazards, as billion-dollar disaster events have affected every state since 1980. The chart above highlights how the frequency of billion-dollar disasters differs across both time and space. The combined historical risk of U.S. severe storms and river flooding events places the spring and summer seasons in the high-risk category for simultaneous extreme weather and climate events, while hurricanes, wildfires and drought dominate the fall season.\n\n## Compound extremes\n\nThe increase in disasters creates 'compound extremes' (e.g., billion-dollar disaster events that occur at the same time or in sequence), which are also an increasing problem for recovery. As noted in the recent Fifth National Climate Assessment (2023)__,__ \"climate change is also increasing the risk of multiple extremes occurring simultaneously in different locations that are connected by complex human and natural systems. For instance, simultaneous megafires across multiple western states and record back-to-back Atlantic hurricanes in 2020 caused unprecedented demand on federal emergency response resources.\"\n\nOther examples include multiple hurricane landfalls (Hurricanes Ian and Nicole) in Florida within a span of several weeks in 2022. And most recently, in 2023, when Central states were impacted by back-to-back severe storm outbreaks compounding the disaster recovery process.\n\nOver the last six years (2018-2022), there were just 18 days on average between billion-dollar disasters compared to 82 days in the 1980s. Shorter time intervals between disasters often mean less time and resources available to respond, recover and prepare for future events. This increased frequency of events produces cascading impacts that are particularly challenging for vulnerable socioeconomic populations.\n\nExplore the billion-dollar disasters database from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information.\n\n## Comments\n\nNOAA employees do not maintain individual social media accounts in their professional capacity.

The model has rapidly gained popularity, igniting discussions across social media platforms and becoming a trending topic. Users have shared various memes and opinions, praising its capabilities and disruptive impact on the AI industry.\n\nDeepSeek-R1’s associated application has surged in downloads, becoming the most downloaded free AI app on the US Apple App Store. It achieved the top spot in India across all app categories, surpassing major players such as ChatGPT and Google Gemini. Sensor Tower data highlights that the app climbed from rank 102 on January 25 to rank 1 by January 27, maintaining its position the following day.\n\nThe app has also performed exceptionally well in the productivity app category, leaping from rank 132 on January 18 to the top position by January 27, displacing ChatGPT. On Android’s Play Store, DeepSeek-R1 has shown significant improvement, climbing from rank 447 on January 16 to rank 15 by January 28, trailing Google Gemini by just one position.\n\nPowered by a reasoning-based AI model with 670 billion parameters, DeepSeek-R1 stands as the largest open-source language model to date. Experts have drawn comparisons between its performance and OpenAI’s GPT-4, particularly in tasks related to mathematics, coding, and reasoning. What sets DeepSeek apart is its cost-effective development process—while OpenAI reportedly spent over $100 million on GPT-4, DeepSeek achieved similar capabilities for just $6 million by leveraging less advanced hardware combined with Nvidia A100 chips.\n\nBeyond the United States, the app has gained immense popularity worldwide. It has become the most downloaded application in countries such as the UK, Australia, Singapore, and Canada. However, its expansion across Europe has been relatively slower, indicating potential challenges in broader global adoption.\n\nAlso Read :- Nakul Jain Steps Down as Paytm Payments Services CEO\n\nChina’s growing expertise in artificial intelligence is evident in DeepSeek’s success. The company’s rise aligns with Beijing’s strategic focus on transitioning from traditional manufacturing to cutting-edge technologies. Despite international restrictions on advanced chip exports to China, DeepSeek has demonstrated an ability to innovate using available resources, raising questions about the effectiveness of such trade limitations.\n\nLike other AI models developed in China, DeepSeek incorporates safeguards to steer clear of politically sensitive subjects. When prompted about the 1989 Tiananmen Square incident, for instance, the app responded with a disclaimer—reflecting the constraints imposed by government regulations. While this censorship may hinder its acceptance in certain international markets, the model maintains high accuracy in other domains by integrating reliable data sources.\n\nThe rapid ascent of DeepSeek signals a notable shift in the AI industry. By combining affordability, scalability, and advanced reasoning capabilities, the company has emerged as a strong competitor to major industry players. Its rise not only disrupts the global AI landscape but also underscores the increasing influence of Chinese tech startups on the international stage.\n\nBe a part of Elets Collaborative Initiatives.

From New York to Wuhan, attention and resources are being directed to fight the spread of COVID-19, a disease caused by the novel coronavirus (officially, SARS-CoV-2). On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared the situation a pandemic.[1] Healthcare systems in even the most advanced countries are being overwhelmed. As the pandemic[2] spreads, the coronavirus will disproportionately impact the world’s most vulnerable, among them refugees, asylum seekers, and internally displaced people (IDPs). These populations must be included in the global response to the virus. This is essential to protecting not only these communities, but societies at large.\n\nThe scale and speed of the pandemic underscore how deeply interconnected the world’s populations are. Nevertheless, at precisely the moment when global solidarity and cooperation are essential, many nations are turning inward as they seek to protect their citizens. But a virus does not respect borders. Nor does it discriminate. A truly effective response, not to mention a morally correct one, also must not discriminate.\n\n“A virus does not respect borders. Nor does it discriminate. A truly effective response, not to mention a morally correct one, also must not discriminate.”\n\nThe world’s more than 70 million forcibly displaced people—including refugees, asylum seekers, IDPs, and other forced migrants—are among the most vulnerable. Already, their displacement leaves them disadvantaged in many ways. The impact of the epidemic both exacerbates and is exacerbated by the conditions in which they live. A series of factors make them extremely vulnerable to the spread of the virus.\n\nThe first factor is population density. Many refugees and internally displaced people live in cramped conditions, including formal camps, informal settlements, or population-dense urban spaces. Multiple families are often forced to share the same bathroom, the same cooking, and the same bathing facilities – if they have access at all. Some are forced to share the same tent. In some countries, asylum seekers and irregular migrants are placed in detention, often in appalling conditions. The ease with which the coronavirus spreads makes these living situations potentially disastrous.\n\nSecond, the forcibly displaced generally have difficulty accessing basic services—especially healthcare. When they have access, it tends to be to primary healthcare. Intensive care – the kind of care that COVID-19 patients need when they develop acute respiratory distress syndrome – is scarce to nonexistent, especially in camp settings. In addition, those fleeing conflict or natural disasters often struggle with underlying health conditions, including malnutrition, psychosocial stress, and other infectious diseases like TB. These conditions make them more vulnerable to the virus.\n\nThird, the limited access to reliable information for displaced communities will complicate efforts to respond. Misinformation, mistrust of authorities, the absence of communication networks, and language barriers can all prevent accurate and far-reaching messaging. Without critical information about the coronavirus, the displaced may not only risk spreading the infection, but find themselves in violation of new policies. At risk of deportation, asylum seekers without legal status are often reticent to trust local authorities, much less reveal themselves once they get sick.\n\nFourth, the humanitarian supply chain may be challenged by the outbreak. Relief workers may reduce or cut contact with displaced communities to help prevent spread of the virus. Many humanitarian actors will not have the training or resources to respond to such an unprecedented crisis. Governments are restricting the travel of international personnel and the movement of vital supplies. Steps to close borders, halt transportation, and shutter businesses are interrupting supply. The resulting shortages of goods could have devastating consequences in many humanitarian contexts.\n\nFinally, as governments, NGOs, and international organizations redirect their attention and resources to combat the pandemic, the financing needed to respond to ongoing humanitarian and displacement crises is at risk of falling dramatically. Already, responses to many of these crises are acutely underfunded. The lasting economic impact of the pandemic on the global economy will only aggravate this problem just as aid agencies find themselves increasingly overwhelmed.\n\nCertainly, many of the challenges that displaced people face will be shared by vulnerable and marginalized citizens in every country affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, we must recognize the unique circumstances of refugees, asylum seekers, IDPs, and other forced migrants in light of the threat an outbreak presents. What follows is a snapshot of how these and other issues are playing out across major humanitarian and displacement crises. The information and analysis in this report reveal key principles and recommendations that should be part of any effective humanitarian response to the pandemic.\n\nAsia\n\nChina was the original epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic. The outbreak of COVID-19 there raised concerns that the virus would spread to other parts of the region, including to south Asia—home to some of the world’s largest populations of refugees and IDPs. Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh, Afghan refugees in Pakistan, and millions of IDPs inside Afghanistan itself shelter in overcrowded and underserved camps and informal settlements. The coronavirus has the potential to wreak havoc in these settings.\n\nAfghan Refugees and Internally Displaced People\n\nAlmost 40 years of conflict have forcibly displaced huge numbers of Afghans. Millions have fled the country and are living in neighboring countries such as Iran, representing one of the largest protracted refugee situations in the world. Iran is a hotbed for COVID-19, now reporting the fourth highest number of deaths in the world.[3] The Iranian government faced criticism for its delay in acknowledging and responding to the seriousness of the outbreak.[4] Not until March 26—with 29,406 cases confirmed and 2,234 deaths—did the government issue an intercity travel ban and close schools, universities, national parks, and non-essential businesses.[5][6] For the more than 3 million Afghans living in Iran, the situation is most dire. Most had difficulty accessing basic services like healthcare even before the current outbreak. Tens of thousands are returning to Afghanistan.\n\nHowever, decades of war have devastated the health system in Afghanistan. Although more than 420 new health facilities have been established since 2014, the healthcare sector remains vastly under resourced.[7] There are approximately three doctors for every 10,000 patients.[8] While Afghanistan is in the midst of fragile peace negotiations, the level of violence remains remarkably high and the population’s humanitarian needs are massive. More than 2.5 million Afghans are internally displaced. Of the 120 COVID-19 cases that have been confirmed in Afghanistan,[9] a significant number had recently come from Iran.[10] They had entered through the city of Herat, where there is no health facility adequately equipped to deal with this illness. Government officials have recommended social distancing measures and even instituted a daytime curfew in Herat, but their recommendations have largely gone unheeded. On March 24, Afghanistan’s health ministry warned that half of the country’s almost 39 million people might be infected.[11]\n\nRohingya Refugees\n\nHealth authorities in Bangladesh are gearing up for a possible COVID-19 outbreak in Rohingya refugee camps. There are nearly 900,000 refugees living in the camps in Cox’s Bazar and more than 400,000 Bangladeshis living in close proximity to them. Cramped living conditions, poor water quality, and patchy access to healthcare in the camps leave refugees vulnerable to disease. A recent humanitarian risk assessment of the Rohingya response warned, “the potential mortality and morbidity risk associated with COVID-19 is likely to surpass global averages.”[12]\n\n“Cramped living conditions, poor water quality, and patchy access to healthcare in the camps leave refugees vulnerable to disease.”\n\nBangladesh’s Ministry of Health is developing a preparedness and response plan in coordination with UN agencies. Hundreds of health workers in the camp area are receiving training to improve disease outbreak detection and prevention.[13] However, UN officials privately warn that they anticipate major problems in managing the spread of the virus inside their own international workforce, much less across the refugee population. The government of Bangladesh is allowing only essential services to reach the camps, undermining efforts to address food insecurity and cyclone preparedness. Meanwhile, health workers there lack personal protective equipment such as gloves and masks. Donors and UN agencies must step up to supply these critical items.\n\nCommunicating with displaced populations about the COVID-19 outbreak will be challenging given refugees’ mistrust of authorities and the absence of formal, credible communications networks. The government continues to restrict phone and internet access in the camps while rumors and false information often spread quickly. This is likely to hinder efforts to prevent and prepare for the spread of the virus. The government of Bangladesh should therefore lift internet and phone restrictions and empower Rohingya civil society organizations that have formed in the camps in order to improve the quality and reach of essential information.[14]\n\nRohingya refugees living in the mega-camp in Bangladesh.

In many cases, this has meant blocking all incoming flights or screening and quarantining passengers of certain nationalities or arriving from specific countries. Though perhaps effective in combating the disease’s spread, these measures have also prevented the delivery of much-needed humanitarian staff and cargo to respond to ongoing crises in these countries. The potential resulting shortages of goods and technical capacity could have devastating consequences in many humanitarian contexts across the continent, where there are more than 17.7 million IDPs and over 6.3 million refugees.\n\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 could also undermine critical peacekeeping efforts in sub-Saharan Africa. Many countries that contribute troops to the United Nations (UN) peacekeeping missions are experiencing outbreaks of the novel coronavirus. As a result, and in order to curb the spread of the disease, the UN recently requested that nine troop-contributing countries delay the regular rotation of their soldiers in and out of peacekeeping missions.[15] In some cases, this could require currently deployed troops to stay in place. The pause in rotations could also lead to continued gaps in critical mission capability. Africa will be disproportionately impacted, as seven of these UN peacekeeping missions operate in conflict and humanitarian crisis zones across the continent.\n\nThe Horn of Africa\n\nEven before the outbreak of COVID-19, countries in the Horn of Africa were grappling with long-standing instability; conflict and the threat of terrorism; and the exacerbating impact of climate change and locust swarms on severe food insecurity. Now, they have registered their first cases of COVID-19—as of March 29, Somalia had three, Ethiopia had 19, and Kenya had 38 confirmed cases.[16] Kenya also confirmed its first death—a 66-year-old Kenyan man who also suffered from diabetes.[17] Meanwhile, the region is home to approximately 5.3 million IDPs and 2.5 million refugees, who are likely to be hit hardest.[18]\n\nAbsent robust public education campaigns about the coronavirus, rumors and false information are spreading rapidly. Fast and accurate information is critical in areas where the health infrastructure is weak and does not have the capacity to face an outbreak. In Ethiopia, which is host to more than 900,000 refugees and more than 2.6 million IDPs,[19] popular sentiment has violently turned against foreigners, who are being blamed for spreading the disease.[20] In Ethiopia’s western Oromia region—where intercommunal violence has displaced thousands—a months-long government-imposed shutdown of phone and internet services is further restricting the ability to provide information on the virus.[21] In addition to limiting information on COVID-19, this inhibits communication among families, doctors, and their patients.\n\nHealth experts are concerned that the outbreak in Somalia, with an IDP population of more than 2.6 million and more than 16,000 refugees, could be among the worst in the world.[22] Decades of conflict have ravaged the country’s health system and other institutions and governance is weak. Al-Shabaab, an Islamic militant group affiliated with al-Qaeda, controls large swaths of territory, limiting the state’s reach and humanitarian workers’ access to populations in need.[23] Because there are no kits to test for COVID-19 in the country, samples must be sent to South Africa for analysis, significantly delaying results and thus the ability to track the disease.[24]\n\nThe government in Somalia has halted international flights, closed schools, and prohibited large public gatherings, but the measures are not well-enforced.[25] To date, Al-Shabaab does not appear to have implemented measures in the regions it controls. Meanwhile, Somalia’s sizable displaced population is particularly at risk.[26] Humanitarian workers warn that the consequences could be devastating for the 3,000 families living in Nabadoon camp, outside Somalia’s capital of Mogadishu.[27] There, a lack of access to clean water, healthcare, and information, as well as cramped living conditions, will facilitate the spread of disease should an outbreak occur. In addition, continued conflict will complicate efforts to reach affected populations as the virus spreads.\n\nCentral Africa\n\nNigeria, where over 2 million people are internally displaced in the country’s northeast, was the first central African state to report cases of the virus. As of March 29, there were 97 confirmed cases of COVID-19.[28] Neighboring Cameroon had confirmed 91 cases, as it grapples with a series of crises that have forced 922,000 of its citizens into internal displacement.[29] Both governments have more capacity than many of their neighbors and could play a leadership role in responding to the pandemic. The Nigerian government should be applauded for working with UN leadership in the country to coordinate response efforts there. Unfortunately, other governments across the region have not done likewise.\n\nCountries like Chad and the Central African Republic (CAR) were reporting three cases in each country as of March 29; however, given the limitations of their health systems, it is uncertain if these are indicative of the actual trend.[30] The outbreak’s impact could be disastrous if the coronavirus spreads beyond the capital cities, especially for the displaced populations in both countries. There are more than half a million IDPs in CAR and 171,000 IDPs in Chad, as well as 468,000 refugees from neighboring countries.[31] These vulnerable populations have little access to clean water or healthcare facilities.\n\nMen stand outside a house in a district that welcomes internally displaced people (IDP) from northern Burkina Faso.

The coronavirus has the potential to put immense pressure on already strained national health services and healthcare provided by humanitarian actors. The situation in Burkina Faso provides a window into the nature of the challenge that could confront neighboring Mali and Niger. There are currently 207 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Burkina Faso. Eleven deaths have been reported, including that of Marie Rose Compaore, the second vice-president of the National Assembly. It is only a matter of time before the disease spreads to the country’s more than half a million IDPs.[32]\n\nAs of March 29, Mali and Niger had both reported 18 cases of COVID-19. However, the lack of infrastructure in both countries prevents both the effective detection and containment of the disease. Moreover, the internally displaced populations in both countries—171,000 people in Mali, and 187,000 in Niger—are not in camps and frequently relocate because of spreading violence.[33] This could increase the likelihood of the virus reaching them and other groups on the move.\n\nAcross the region, humanitarian funding is in short supply and displaced populations already lacks access to health services, water, and sanitation. Basic measures recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and World Health Organization—such as stringent hand washing with soap and water and social distancing—are largely impractical in this context. The UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) had planned to host a donor conference for the Sahel in mid-June to secure badly needed funding for the emergency. However, the conference has now been postponed because of COVID-19.\n\nThe Democratic Republic of Congo\n\nIn the Great Lakes Region, 30 people in Uganda, 60 in Rwanda, and 65 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) had tested positive for COVID-19 as of March 29, 2020.[34] With over 5 million displaced persons (the vast majority of whom are IDPs), the DRC has the largest number of displaced people in the region.[35] The first week of March 2020 marked the end of the DRC’s two-year-long Ebola outbreak. But the celebrations were cut short by the arrival of the novel coronavirus. As the DRC grapples with the spread of this new pandemic, it is important that health facilities built to respond to the Ebola outbreak be repurposed to treat cases of COVID-19. While discussions to that effect have already begun, very little action has been taken. NGOs are beginning to integrate messaging about the coronavirus into their current programs. However, planning and implementation must be accelerated.\n\nSouth Sudan\n\nFollowing years of civil war, nearly one-third of South Sudan’s population remains displaced—there are about 1.47 million IDPs in South Sudan and 2.2 million refugees in neighboring countries.[36] With more than half the population facing acute food insecurity and poor health infrastructure, South Sudan is highly vulnerable to the spread and harmful effects of infectious diseases. No cases of COVID-19 had been reported in the country as of publication of this report, but several cases had been confirmed in neighboring countries. To prevent and prepare for a possible outbreak, South Sudan has suspended all international flights and locked down its land borders to all but cargo buses, food trucks, and fuel tanks.[37]\n\nThe presence of a large UN peacekeeping mission with significant staff rotations in South Sudan adds an additional potential vector for the disease to spread to the country. Almost 200,000 IDPs live in Protection of Civilian sites on or near peacekeeping bases.[38] The UN and troop contributing countries are taking steps to limit the potential for exposure, including a temporary freeze on staff travel into South Sudan.[39]\n\nThe Americas\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has already had significant implications for major humanitarian hotspots across the Americas. To date, the response by governments has varied widely. Countries like Peru, Guatemala, and Colombia implemented strong measures early to combat the spread of the virus.[40] However, Mexico and Brazil have been slow to adopt mitigation measures, even dismissing the severity of the crisis.[41] In Central America, many countries have adopted stricter border policies but have acquiesced to demands from the United States to continue receiving deported nationals. Many countries in South America have closed their borders to the movement of people, including for displaced Venezuelans.\n\nThe U.S. Border\n\nThe United States now leads the world in confirmed coronavirus cases.[42] Before the outbreak of COVID-19, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) had returned over 60,000 asylum seekers to northern Mexico to await their U.S. immigration court dates there. This was done under the Trump administration’s Migration Protection Protocols (MPP), known as the “Remain in Mexico” program.[43] These asylum seekers—mostly from Central America, Cuba, and Venezuela—were returned to unsafe conditions in Mexico, and left to await their hearings in ill-equipped shelters and informal open-air encampments where disease could spread rapidly. In addition, there were 15,000 individuals waiting to seek asylum outside U.S. ports of entry as of February 2020. These individuals—three quarters of whom are Mexican—were living in the same grim conditions as those impacted by the MPP program.[44]\n\nOn March 21, the U.S. government mandated port and border closures in response to the pandemic. No exceptions are being made for asylum seekers or unaccompanied minors. The border closure empowers DHS to immediately turn back to Mexico or repatriate to their home countries other than Mexico all asylum seekers without due process—a clear violation of U.S. obligations under domestic and international law.[45] These measures were instituted well after introduction of the virus to the United States. They have impeded the ability of humanitarian workers to bring critical supplies to Mexico. In addition, some of the shelters housing asylum seekers on the Mexican side of the border have been forced to close because of the virus.[46]\n\nAs a result of the border closures, the United States has already begun to turn away or repatriate all migrants lacking documents authorizing their entry—including asylum seekers and unaccompanied minors—to countries including Mexico,[47] Guatemala,[48] Honduras,[49] and Ecuador. Authorities are not screening individuals to determine if they are victims of human trafficking or have credible fears of persecution in their home countries. Nor are they taking precautions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. The Mexican government has agreed to accept most Central American returnees (though not unaccompanied minors).[50] It is not clear if the United States or Mexico intends to arrange the deportation of others, such as Venezuelans or Cubans, in lieu of allowing them to seek asylum in the United States.\n\nMoreover, many of the NGOs that typically play a crucial monitoring role at the U.S. border have been forced to reduce or cease operations in light of efforts to reduce the spread of COVID-19 within the United States. This makes it crucial that the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) monitor returns and conditions along the border. Despite U.S. government restrictions on travel and commerce, the delivery of critical humanitarian supplies to Mexico should be considered “essential” and allowed to continue.\n\nThe rule closing the border is predicated on the false assumption that the only possible alternative to turning away asylum seekers is detaining them in unsafe, overcrowded border facilities for lengthy periods of time. In fact, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agency could instead expeditiously parole asylum seekers into the United States, where the vast majority have ties to families, friends, or faith-based communities.[51] In the weeks ahead, U.S. border officials should allow people to follow the U.S. legal process to request asylum and provide screening and referral to health facilities if necessary. Asylum seekers should then be released to homes and NGO-run shelters, through parole or other community-based alternatives to detention, where they can appropriately socially distance and be permitted to continue their cases in immigration court when the courts resume operations.[52] CBP should screen unaccompanied minors and send then to the Office of Refugee Resettlement which must, according to a new court order, quickly plan to release them to sponsors.[53]\n\nMexico\n\nMexico is both a transit and destination country for displaced people. Asylum seekers and other forced migrants come primarily from Central America, but also from South America and Africa. They are often at higher risk of exposure to the coronavirus because of their living conditions. Many are detained in detention centers known as “migratory stations,” stay in privately-run shelters while they await their asylum claims in Mexico to be processed, or, as described above, live in informal camps on the northern border while they await their court hearings in the United States.\n\nMexico has 848 registered cases of COVID-19.[54] Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador was criticized for long ignoring the crisis, even traveling across the country and holding gatherings with large crowds. Now, the government has begun to take steps to contain the virus, such as calling for Mexicans to stay in their homes for a month[55] and limiting tourism.[56] It is also working to reduce overcrowding among the migrant and forcibly displaced populations in migratory stations across the country.[57] However, the government continues to accept the return of Mexicans deported from the United States despite inadequate health screenings prior to deportation. Grim conditions and the absence of healthcare and other services in the informal camps where they often stay are perhaps of greatest concern.\n\nThe Mexican authorities must more aggressively encourage practices to prevent the spread of the coronavirus and President López Obrador should lead by example. In migratory stations, specifically, Mexico’s National Migration Institute (INAMI) should continue to implement mitigation measures and reduce the number of detained migrants when possible, with support from independent civil society organizations. The Mexican government has indicated that it would suspend the processing of asylum requests until April 20. However, it should resume these operations as soon as possible. In the interim, Mexico should ensure that asylum seekers whose claims are on hold have access to adequate shelter and healthcare, including testing for COVID-19. Mexico should not be expected to accept asylum seekers returned under the MPP program until basic safeguards can be put in place to protect the health of returnees.\n\nCentral America\n\nThe countries of Central America grapple with extreme violence and lack institutional capacity to respond to a pandemic. Civilians eager to escape violence have no recourse, prevented from fleeing because of border closures. Meanwhile, hundreds of Central Americans are deported from the United States each week.\n\nGuatemala has confirmed 34 cases COVID-19.[58] On March 16, the government suspended all international flights and closed the borders for 15 days.[59] On March 17, it announced the temporary suspension of transfers of Hondurans and Salvadorans from the United States to Guatemala under the Asylum Cooperation Agreement (ACA). (The United States has used the ACA to bar asylum seekers from applying for protection in the United States, instead sending them to Guatemala.) The Guatemalan government initially announced that it would suspend the acceptance of Guatemalan nationals deported by the Unites States. However, it reversed this decision in a just a matter of days and deportations of Guatemalans have resumed. The Guatemalan government is warning its citizens that they will be immediately deported if they attempt to go to the United States.[60]\n\nIn El Salvador, President Nayib Bukele announced that the country would bar entry to all foreigners, except accredited diplomats and legal permanent residents. President Bukele announced the creation of a special hospital for patients with COVID-19 and called for a halt of deportations from Mexico and the United States on March 18.[61] Nonetheless, deportation flights to El Salvador have continued.[62] As of March 29, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras all received U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) air flights from the United States.[63]\n\nThe Guatemalan government should remain firm in its decision to halt transfers of asylum seekers under the ACA. Even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was unreasonable to forcibly send Salvadorans and Hondurans asylum seekers to a country, Guatemala, that cannot provide them with adequate safety and security. In cases of deportation of Guatemalan, Salvadoran, or Honduran migrants who have not made claims to asylum, the United States should adopt comprehensive screenings prior to departures to ensure safety of other deportees and to avoid overwhelming these countries’ fragile health systems during this public health crisis. Guatemalans, Salvadorans, and Hondurans who test positive should not be deported.\n\nThe Venezuela Crisis\n\nUnder the regime of President Nicolás Maduro, Venezuelans have suffered years of economic collapse, institutional failure, and political turmoil. Hyperinflation, generalized violence, and political repression are rife in a country where the vast majority live in poverty. In February 2020, the UN World Food Program stated that 9.3 million people in Venezuela—about one-third of the population—faced food insecurity.[64] As more than 4.9 million people have fled the country, over 1 million children have been left without their parents.[65]\n\nAs of March 29, 2020, there were 119 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Venezuela. Although World Health Organization records do not indicate any deaths, Venezuelan officials have confirmed at least one death.[66] A “social quarantine” has been established nation-wide, and military forces have been deployed throughout the country to enforce restrictions on movement. Nevertheless, not all citizens are complying, as small crowds continue to line up to obtain food and other essential goods. On March 24, the government ordered stricter isolation measures in the three states—Caracas, Miranda, and Vargas—that account for 70 percent of COVID-19 cases.[67] The country’s years-long economic crisis has left its health system and other institutions in complete collapse.[68] Hospitals lack adequate facilities, medical personnel, supplies, and medication.[69] For the public, face masks, soap, and even water for hand-washing[70] are either unavailable or unaffordable.[71]\n\nNicolás Maduro has called on the United States to lift its sanctions on the country in order to open access to foreign investments and finance that could help fund a response. Human rights groups, and EU leaders,[72] as well as the UN Secretary-General[73] and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights[74] have echoed these calls. On March 26, the United States indicted Maduro with narco-terrorism and other serious charges in a move it could use to justify additional sanctions.[75] Maduro also tried and failed to secure a $5 billion loan from a special emergency fund of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).[76] President Xi Jinping of China sent 4,000 diagnosis kits,[77] and Cuba sent a medical brigade to help.[78] Meanwhile, Maduro’s long-held opposition to international aid organizations will further heighten the likelihood that the outbreak does outsized damage.\n\nThe pandemic risks exacerbating the pre-existing humanitarian crisis inside Venezuela—a crisis that has already compelled millions from Venezuelans to seek refuge in other countries.[79] As the situation deteriorates, more Venezuelans are likely to try to flee to neighboring Colombia and Brazil. Faced with official border closings, they may instead resort to taking dangerous unofficial routes out of the country, known as trochas, that are often controlled by armed groups. Those who are able to cross irregularly will, in turn, have trouble accessing the care they need in their host countries, and thus risk further spreading the virus.\n\nVenezuelans in Colombia\n\nAs of March 29, the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 inside Colombia had risen to 608, with six deaths reported.[80] That day, after several temporary “quarantine drills” in parts of the country, a 19-day nation-wide lockdown went into effect.[81] As of March 17, the government had closed the country’s borders. Colombia is host to the largest number of displaced Venezuelans, by far—according to official reports, more than 1.7 million Venezuelans were in Colombia as of December 31, 2019. Since the start of the displacement crisis, the Colombian government has maintained a relatively generous response.[82] However, as the international response to the Venezuelan displacement crisis remains acutely underfunded and Colombia faces its own economic challenges, the situation has begun to stress the country’s public services—including the healthcare system. The coronavirus pandemic is likely to exacerbate these challenges.\n\nThe impact of the pandemic on displaced Venezuelans living in Colombia is likely to be severe. First, despite the fact that Venezuelans have the right to free emergency healthcare in Colombia regardless of their immigration status, many cannot access that care because facilities lack capacity or because health workers are unaware of Venezuelans’ rights or even discriminate against them. Those who have regular status and are able to obtain insurance may have an easier time accessing care, and a broader range of care. Nevertheless, the majority of Venezuelans in Colombia have been unable to regularize their status. The number of Venezuelans with irregular status is only expected to increase as a result of the border closing. As indicated above, Venezuelans desperate for aid may instead resort to using informal channels to enter Colombia.[83]\n\nMany Venezuelans—including the pendulares who still live in Venezuela and cross frequently into Colombia to purchase goods or attend school—rely heavily on aid provided by international organizations and NGOs near the border. However, as part of the measures to close the border, the Colombian government ordered NGOs in the area to cut their capacity by half.[84] Moreover, on March 16, the Colombian Department of Health announced that gatherings of more than 50 people would be prohibited.[85] The restriction will inevitably impact organizations’ ability to operate in centers where Venezuelans shelter or gather to seek aid.\n\nTwo young Venezuelans with face marks cross the Rumichaca Bridge on the border between Colombia and Ecuador.

According to the latest official figures, Peru is host to the second largest number of Venezuelans (861,000 as of February 7, 2020).[86] As of December 31, 2019, Ecuador is host to 366,596 Venezuelans.\n\nOn March 15, Ecuador—where 1,823 cases and 48 deaths have now been reported—closed its borders to all foreign travelers.[87] Gatherings of more than 30 people were also banned.[88] In Peru, where 671 cases have been confirmed,[89] Peruvian President Martín Vizcarra also declared a state of emergency on March 15 and initially shut the country’s borders for 15 days.[90] Four days later, the government imposed a nationwide curfew and ban on private vehicles.[91]On March 25, President Vizcarra extended a state of emergency and nationwide quarantine through April 12.[92]\n\nThese border closures affect Venezuelans on the move from Colombia to Ecuador, Peru, and other third countries. For Venezuelans already inside these host countries, limited access to healthcare, loss of their livelihoods, and limits on movement and available services will put them at higher risk of infection or complications.\n\nOn March 18, Brazil ordered a partial closing of its border with Venezuela for 15 days.[93] President Bolsonaro has been criticized for his lax response to the pandemic, raising fears that the toll inside the country will be high.[94]Already, by March 25, there were 2,271 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 47 deaths. The latest official figures indicate that Brazil was host to more than 250,000 Venezuelans as of November 30, 2019, though the current number is likely much higher. Despite the government’s attempts to relocate Venezuelans who have crossed into the country, the majority remain concentrated in remote, impoverished areas along the northern border, where resources and infrastructure are sparse.[95] The inevitable damage from the coronavirus is thus likely to affect Venezuelans inside the country even as the border closing hinders others from accessing the critical healthcare they lack in Venezuela.\n\nEurope\n\nEurope has been hard hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. At the end of 2018, there were nearly 2.5 million refugees and 646,060 asylum seekers in the European Union (EU) alone.[96] As of March 17, just 10 cases had been reported among refugees and asylum seekers, all of them in Germany. Already, however, countries had begun to close their borders to asylum seekers. By March 16, Greece, Hungary, Belgium, and the Netherlands had shut their asylum offices.[97] In other countries, including Italy, asylum services have significantly slowed. Due to health and travel restrictions imposed to contain the spread of the coronavirus, NGOs have had to suspend search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean Sea for those attempting to cross from war-torn Libya.[98] Meanwhile, nationalist leaders and politicians—from Italy to Spain—have seized upon the outbreak as a false basis for xenophobic, anti-refugee rhetoric and policies.[99]\n\nItaly\n\nAs of March 29, 2020, there were 92,472 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy and 10,023 deaths—more deaths than in any other country. More than ten days after ordering a strict, nationwide lockdown, with the number of deaths surging, the Italian government called in the military on March 20 to enforce its approach.[100] On March 22, the Prime Minister ordered all non-essential businesses and factories to close and prohibited all non-essential movement within the country.[101] Even as the number of new cases in Italy began to slow, the government was expected to extend containment measures beyond the initial April 3 deadline.[102]\n\nThe impact on refugees and asylum seekers has been significant.[103] At the end of 2018, there were nearly 300,000 refugees and asylum seekers in Italy. Heeding lockdown and “social distancing” orders is difficult for these individuals, who often work in informal jobs, live in close quarters, and rely on government and NGO assistance. On March 12, the government suspended interviews for refugee status determination (RSD) and hearings for appeals of rejected asylum requests given court closures. By law, foreigners in Italy have access to healthcare. In practice, many asylum seekers fear going to hospitals if undocumented, or face discrimination or language barriers. All this will make it harder to detect the virus in a highly vulnerable population.\n\nGreece\n\nAs of March 29, Greece confirmed 1,156 coronavirus cases and 38 deaths.[104] While this is less than several other European countries, the Greek government is concerned that if it does not act quickly, it could follow the trajectory of Italy. Greece has therefore enacted a country-wide lockdown, closing hotels and suspending most international flights.[105] The Ministry of Migration and Asylum has suspended all administrative services until April 13 at the earliest. This includes registering asylum seekers, conducting interviews, adjudicating cases, and reviewing appeals.\n\nThe shutdown of the entire Greek asylum system leaves all asylum seekers in a precarious position. Arguably, no population in Greece is more vulnerable to the coronavirus than the more than 40,000 asylum seekers trapped on the Aegean Islands.[106] Conditions are appalling in the Reception and Identification Centers (RICs) where asylum seekers are required to live. The official RICs and their overflow areas are squalid and overcrowded, hosting approximately eight times their capacity. These areas lack basic hygiene facilities, have very few latrines, and provide minimal medical care at best. There is no running water, making frequent hand washing impractical.\n\nMigrants living in the Moria camp sew handmade protective face masks on the Greek island of Lesbos, as the country is under lockdown to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus. Photo by MANOLIS LAGOUTARIS/AFP/Getty Images.\n\nNGOs on the islands report that no significant steps have been taken to prepare the camps for an outbreak of the coronavirus. Instead, the government instituted a curfew and prohibited NGOs from entering the camps for at least 14 days.[107] These measures reduce essential services in the camps, including food distributions, childcare, and servicing latrines. Relief groups have been calling on the Greek government to evacuate camp residents to facilities across the country in order to save the lives of asylum seekers and Greek citizens alike.[108] The EU has now echoed this call to evacuate the most vulnerable asylum seekers in the camps to other areas on the islands,[109] a crucial first step to protect asylum seekers and limit the likely spread in the camps.\n\nThe Middle East\n\nThe Middle East is fast becoming an epicenter of the coronavirus crisis. Cases have escalated dramatically in Lebanon and Iran. New infections have emerged in more than half a dozen other countries in the region including Iraq and Afghanistan. At least 12 million refugees and IDPs live in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Turkey. Borders throughout the Middle East are porous, with refugees, economic migrants, and others often traveling along informal routes. Another challenge to an effective coronavirus response is the region’s weak or broken public health systems.\n\nHowever, the situation also differs significantly between countries. Turkey, with over 3.4 million Syrian refugees, has a robust healthcare system and the government is somewhat better positioned to respond to an outbreak and employ basic containment tools like contact tracing. On the other hand, Iraq and Lebanon have severely weak public health systems and are not able to adequately monitor what is going on and provide a robust public health response.\n\nThe Syria Crisis\n\nSyria’s brutal war entered its tenth year last month. More than 5.6 million have fled Syria since 2011, and over 6.5 million remain displaced inside the country.[110] The majority of Syrian refugees in neighboring countries and internally displaced Syrians lack the most basic needs, including access to healthcare. Even the most basic guidance on social distancing and personal hygiene will be difficult to follow where refugees and IDPs often live in overcrowded and unhygienic camps and informal settlements.\n\nThe situation in the northwest of Syria is of particular concern. It will be extremely challenging to launch an effective response to a coronavirus outbreak in places like Idlib province. While no confirmed cases of Coronavirus have been announced in Idlib, this appears to be largely due to the lack of testing kits. At least three people who showed symptoms of COVID-19 died in the past week, and there are several other patients with the virus symptoms who are quarantined inside hospitals, a doctor and a representative of a medical organization in Idlib told Refugees International. More than 1 million people are staying in overcrowded and unhygienic camps where it is very challenging to impose social distancing.[111] Very few people are staying home. The economic situation is such that if people do not work, they do not have the means to feed their families. Moreover, there is no authority inside Idlib that has the means to enforce preventive measures, and the various fighting factions on the ground appear to have other priorities.\n\nSyrians are seen on the mud covered road between tents at a refugee camp after heavy rain in Idlib, Syria. Syrian refugees, who have been living in the camp, face flooding, mud, and puddles due to lack of infrastructure and sewerage network.

The facilities that remain will have little of the equipment required to treat coronavirus patients, such as ventilators, or to protect healthcare workers from infection as they go about their duties. On March 25, WHO delivered 300 testing kits to the northwest.[112] The main challenge is that the whole area has only around 100 ventilators. Efforts to screen populations with infrared non-contact thermometers are also necessary. Any type of support for the general capacity of what remains of the medical system in northwest Syria could make a significant difference.\n\nOutside of Syria, more needs to be done now to help prepare the camps and communities that host Syrian refugees in neighboring countries. Countries like Lebanon, host to more than 1 million Syrian refugees, are already experiencing significant outbreaks that are taxing their national healthcare systems. Jordan hosts the second largest Syrian refugee population per capita in the world. Because these refugees are unlikely to be a top priority for the national authorities, the international humanitarian community must step in to fill the gaps, in collaboration with host governments.\n\nIraq\n\nDecades of conflict and widespread violence have wreaked havoc on the lives of millions of civilians in Iraq. According to UNHCR, more than 6.5 million people—approximately 18 percent of the population—are currently in need of humanitarian assistance, including 3 million children.[113] Nearly 2 million people remain displaced inside the country, the majority of whom have taken refuge in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI). Moreover, Iraq is host to around 300,000, mostly Syrian, refugees.[114] Many live inside camps where poor conditions and outdated infrastructure could exacerbate the spread of the coronavirus.[115]\n\nAs of March 29, 547 cases of confirmed coronavirus had been reported in Iraq.[116] However, the real number was likely much higher. The country’s health system, undermined by decades of sanctions, neglect, corruption and violence, suffers from significant gaps including shortages of supplies, equipment, and staff.[117] To prevent further spread of the virus, the Baghdad and KRI governments imposed a curfew and cancelled all domestic flights. However, security forces are struggling to enforce the lockdown as thousands of pilgrims from across the country visit shrines in the capital.[118] In addition, humanitarian actors have reported that curfews and movement restrictions are impacting the delivery of assistance to people in need.[119]\n\nHumanitarian groups in Iraq have developed a COVID-19 preparedness and response planning in the camps. Moreover, UN agencies are supporting Iraq with testing capacities and the procurement of personal protective equipment for health partners. Donors and humanitarian organizations should increase their efforts to support Iraq and the KRI government’s response. They should offer personnel support to fill staff shortages and provide the necessary supplies and equipment.\n\nYemen\n\nThe WHO announced that, so far, there are no confirmed cases of coronavirus in Yemen.[120] However, a virus outbreak will almost certainly have a devastating effect. Yemen hosts what may be the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, with more than 24 million people in need of assistance, and nearly 3.65 million internally displaced.[121] A relentless war has decimated the country’s healthcare system. In the past few years, Yemen has witnessed the worst cholera epidemic in recent history.[122]\n\nLast week, both the Houthi rebels and Yemen’s internationally recognized government banned international flights in an attempt to keep the country free of the coronavirus.[123] The ban includes chartered medical evacuations. Despite the halt to passenger flights, the UN-led Yemen aid operation continues for the moment, with the vast majority of staff being Yemeni. The UN confirmed that seaports remain open for cargo. Yemen is largely reliant on cargo arriving by sea for imports of food, fuel, and other consumer essentials critical to civilian welfare.\n\nThe WHO is supporting the national health authorities to prepare for the coronavirus with medical supplies, testing kits, training, and information campaigns. However, some international relief teams have scaled back to essential staff only. A fingerprint-driven digital registration system for aid recipients to limit aid fraud has been paused.[124] Top priority, life-saving assistance such as food, water, sanitation, and health services will continue, but some less critical aid programs will be slowed. The international humanitarian community must step in to help Yemen’s medical personnel to prepare for a virus outbreak. It should particularly provide medical facilities with testing kits, medical equipment, and supplies in addition to personnel protective gear to help protect healthcare workers.\n\nRecommendations\n\nThe challenge of containing and mitigating the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic across the world’s most vulnerable, displaced populations is breathtaking in scope. Each humanitarian crisis will require a strategy tailored to the specific needs and circumstances of the displaced population in question – a strategy that is workable in a context that will undoubtedly include significant resource constraints. That said, there are common elements across the countries and continents reviewed above, which lend themselves to key principles and recommendations that should be part of any effective humanitarian response to the pandemic.\n\nThe response must be inclusive: The response to COVID-19 must be inclusive if it is to be effective. International assistance to address the pandemic must reach all vulnerable populations, including the refugees, asylum seekers, and the internally displaced. Governments receiving U.S. assistance for COVID-19 should ensure that the forcibly displaced living in both camp and non-camp settings are included in prevention and mitigation efforts. By the same token, aid for refugees and internally displaced people to address the COVID-19 pandemic should be made available to host communities in refugee-hosting areas. In short, the aim should be to improve systems for all persons regardless of nationality.\n\nEnhance communications and the flow of information: Governments and international aid groups should develop information campaigns to ensure displaced communities have accurate and current information about the coronavirus and response efforts. Where possible, they should work with local civil society and displaced persons themselves to ensure language and means of communications are easily accessible and widely disseminated. Governments should lift any phone and internet restrictions in and around displaced communities.\n\nDeploy medical personnel, supplies, and personal protective equipment: Donors and international aid groups should prioritize the deployment of qualified medical personnel to refugee, asylum seeker, and IDP-dense areas, along with personal protective equipment and other medical supplies such as gloves and masks for humanitarian health workers to ensure their safety in addressing COVID-19 outbreaks in displacement camps. Appropriate training for existing health care personnel must occur, particularly for treatment of severe cases with limited ICU access.\n\nPrioritize hygiene and other WASH-related interventions: Donors and international aid groups should improve access to water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) facilities for refugee and internally displaced populations – especially those living in camps or camp-like settings. This should include the distribution of essential personal hygiene items including soap and disposable towels. The response should also recognize best practices for response for particularly vulnerable populations, such as women and girls.\n\nFocus on decongestion and isolation and quarantine capacities: Donors, host governments, and international aid groups should prioritize decongestion and building isolation and quarantine capacities in camps and camp-like settings. Services like food distribution and education should be restructured to avoid large gatherings. Donors and others should take steps now to support establishment of capabilities within displaced communities for implementation of isolation and quarantine procedures in accordance with best medical and public health advice and practices. Given the extremely high density of certain settings, novel strategies for “shielding” may need to be carefully attempted.\n\nBuild up testing and surveillance capabilities: Donors and international aid groups should prioritize deployment of rapid testing capability in adequate quantity to refugee and IDP settings. With respect to surveillance, the good news is that many formal camps already have epidemiological surveillance systems already in place. These need to be strengthened and adapted to screen for COVID-19, especially for all new arrivals in the camps.\n\nStop detentions and deportations of asylum seekers: Public health officials universally agree that detention in crowded facilities increases the risk of transmission for asylum seekers and immigrants in custody, along with immigration and border officials. Governments should put in place alternatives to detention polices and ensure that all migrants have access to testing and healthcare regardless of status. Deportation of any individuals without prior medical testing risks exporting the virus into countries unprepared to deal with mass outbreaks because of pre-existing crises and substantial vulnerable and marginalized populations with little access to limited healthcare systems.\n\nProtect those who fear persecution from forced return: Any restrictions that governments impose on travel should include provisions that safeguard individuals from forced return to torture or persecution. Moreover, extraordinary policy measures that impose unusual burdens for those seeking asylum should be lifted as soon as circumstances permit. In times of national emergency, protecting vulnerable people from gross abuses of their basic rights can become far more challenging for governments, but it is at those very times when our commitment to such rights is decisively measured.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nRefugees International would like to thank the following people for their contributions to this report:\n\nTony Banbury , President and CEO of the International Foundation for Electoral Systems\n\n, President and CEO of the International Foundation for Electoral Systems Chris Beyrer , Desmond M.

Britons have criticized the EU for its handling of a range of issues, resent the loss of power to the Brussels-based institution and are divided among themselves about the institution they first joined in 1973.\n\nMore broadly, a Pew Research Center survey conducted this spring found that publics in a number of other EU countries share the British desire for a less, not more, centralized Europe, and that the debate about the future of the EU will not subside just because the UK has now voted.\n\nThe EU has never been as popular in the UK as it has been among other EU members. Just 44% of the public in the UK has a favorable view of the EU, compared with a median of 50% who hold a favorable opinion in five other EU nations surveyed by Pew Research Center. Support for the EU is down in the UK from a high of 52% in 2014. British views of the EU have consistently been lower than those on the continent for nearly a decade.\n\nThe British have long thought that the EU was inefficient and intrusive and has mishandled the challenges facing Europe. In a 2014 Pew Research Center survey, 64% of the British thought the EU was inefficient and does not understand the needs of its citizens. Six-in-ten said it was intrusive. In this year’s survey, 70% in the UK disapprove of the EU’s handling of the refugee issue and 55% said the same about the EU’s dealing with economic issues.\n\nThe vote to leave reflects the desire of nearly two-thirds of the UK public to bring back some EU powers from Brussels to London. Fully 65% of the British said before the referendum that they wanted some EU powers to be returned to their national government. This included 73% of those ages 50 and older, 70% of men, 68% of those with a secondary education or less, 93% of UK Independence Party supporters, 77% of Conservative Party adherents and 49% of Labour Party backers.\n\nThe Brexit vote exposes a rift in public opinion between the Scottish and people in the rest of the United Kingdom. The Scottish voted to stay in the EU by an overwhelming margin of 62% to 38%, putting a new Scottish independence referendum on the table. Pew Research Center data show that the Scottish are more likely than those in England, Northern Ireland and Wales to have a favorable opinion of the EU (53% versus 43% respectively).\n\nScotland also disagrees with the rest of the UK on two issues central to the Brexit debate: the economy and immigration. The Scottish feel more threatened by the prospect of global economic instability than their counterparts in the rest of the UK. Roughly six-in-ten say it is a major threat to their country, while only 48% say the same in England, Northern Ireland and Wales. Meanwhile, the rest of the UK feels more threatened by the large number of refugees leaving countries such as Iraq and Syria (54% major threat). Just 41% of Scottish people agree.\n\nThe rest of Europe sees Brexit as pivotal for the well-being of the EU. Before the referendum, a median of 70% said that they thought it would be a bad thing for the EU if the UK were to leave. This included 89% of the Swedes, 75% of the Dutch and 74% of the Germans.\n\nThe debate in other EU member states about the future of the institution may just be getting started. A majority of the Greeks (68%) and pluralities of the Dutch (44%), Germans (43%), Italians (39%) and French (39%) all want some EU power returned to their national governments. Both the Dutch and the French have a history of holding referendums on major and not-so-major issues, and Euroskeptic parties in both countries have already voiced support for a public vote on their relationship with the EU.\n\nNOTE (April 2017): After publication, the weight for the Netherlands data was revised to correct percentages for two regions. The impact of this revision on the Netherlands data included in this blog post is very minor and does not materially change the analysis. For a summary of changes, see here. For updated demographic figures for the Netherlands, please contact info@pewresearch.org.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nOver three million Brits called for a do-over.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA. Northern Ireland and Scotland voted to remain in the EU.\nB. David Cameron announced his resignation as Prime Minister.\nC. The UK voted to leave the EU in a June 23 referendum.\nD.

Satellite data from Brazil's National Institute of Space Research shows that there have been more than 74,000 fires this year, many of them in the Amazon. The demonstrations are \"in defense of the Amazon and our future,\" according to organizers.\n\nOver the past few days, international pressure has been steadily growing on Bolsonaro over his handling of the issue, especially from European leaders. A spokesman for Britain's newly installed prime minister, Boris Johnson, said he was \"deeply concerned\" about the fires and \"the impact of the tragic loss of these precious habitats.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron plans to highlight the Amazon crisis at this weekend's G-7 summit in Biarritz, France, after sending out a tweet describing them as \"an international crisis\" and declaring: \"Our house is burning. Literally. The Amazon rain forest — the lungs which produces 20% of the planet's oxygen — is on fire.\"\n\nMacron raised the pressure on Brazil on Friday, issuing a statement accusing Bolsonaro of lying to him about his position on climate change and announcing that France has withdrawn its support for the Mercosur trade deal between the European Union and a South American bloc that includes Brazil. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar warned that Ireland would pull out of the Mercosur agreement if Brazil did not take action to protect the rainforest, according to Reuters.\n\nBolsonaro has made clear that he considers the Amazon rainforest — 60% of which is in Brazil — to be an issue of national sovereignty, and he makes no secret of his resentment at what he deems to be foreign interference driven by a desire to hold back Brazilian agrobusiness from competing in international markets.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption AP AP\n\nIn recent weeks, he has alienated Germany and Norway, the two main contributors to the Amazon Fund, which supports forest preservation initiatives, prompting them to withhold tens of millions of dollars.\n\nHis approach has won applause from his supporters on the far right, but is also causing widespread fears among Brazilians that it is proving highly damaging to the country's international standing and may prompt a backlash that could impact exports.\n\n\"The image of the burning forest ignites public opinion and incinerates Brazil's reputation,\" wrote Ana Lucia Azevedo, a columnist for O Globo. She warns that the crisis is wrecking \"the prestige and credibility\" acquired by Brazil after 2005, when deforestation rates dipped sharply.\n\nAnother commentator, Vinicius Torrer Freire, wrote: \"Within a few months, especially in recent weeks, he has knocked down two decades of improvements in Brazil's international image regarding the environment.\"\n\nBolsonaro argues that it is possible simultaneously to develop the Amazon and preserve the forest. His critics point to his record of relentlessly undermining institutions responsible for preserving and monitoring the Amazon.\n\nSince taking office in January, he has severely weakened government environmental enforcement organizations, by cutting budgets and laying off staff. When Brazil's National Institute of Space Research released satellite data showing a sharp month-on-month rise in deforestation over last year, Bolsonaro dismissed this as \"lies\" and replaced the director with a military official.\n\nLatin America Brazil's Amazon Rainforest Is Disappearing Under President Jair Bolsonaro Brazil's Amazon Rainforest Is Disappearing Under President Jair Bolsonaro Listen · 7:57 7:57\n\nHis approach is causing deep concern among professionals fighting to protect the forest, who argue that these moves send the wrong message to illegal deforesters.\n\n\"They feel emboldened to carry out more deforestation,\" said Fluvio Mascarenhas, who works for the Chico Mendes Institute for the Conversation of Biodiversity — a government monitoring agency — in the western state of Acre.\n\nIn a recent interview with NPR, Mascarenhas expressed profound concern about the impact of Bolsonaro's policies.\n\n\"Every time you look at a satellite image of the forest, you see another little piece is missing,\" he said.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nPresident Bolsonaro announced a 60-day ban on setting fires for land clearing and deployed 44,000 soldiers to seven states.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA. Brazilian authorities are investigating 70 farmers and land grabbers in Pará for allegedly organizing an August 10 'Day of Fire.'\nB.

Being that the launch of their OS comes at a time where the company is facing a ban from America, and potential complete restriction from using Operating Systems like Android by Google, and Windows by Microsoft, most people are seeing Huawei’s announcement as a way of them showing the world they’re ready for any eventualities.\n\nThe first product running HarmonyOS is a TV. It isn’t your normal smart TV. It even has an AI powered pop-up selfie camera.\n\nWhen you think of it, Huawei isn’t launching a TV just for the fun of showing off their new OS. No. Many smartphone companies are currently getting into the TV business. We’ve seen Xiaomi with their incredibly priced TVs, and more recently OnePlus has been teasing their upcoming TV. Unlike the others Huawei’s Honor TV won’t be running Android TV OS.\n\nHonor Vision features a 4K Ultra-HD 55-inch LCD TV with a maximum brightness of 400 nits. The screen to body ratio is 94% because of the extra tiny bezels, but somehow there’s six 10-watt speakers and support for wireless communication with Bluetooth 5.0. There is three HDMI 2.0 inputs, one HDMI Arc port, one USB 2.0 jack, an AV port, DTMB, S/PDIF and, an Ethernet connector.\n\nLike Google Fuchsia OS, HarmonyOS is a microkernel-based OS and can run on multiple device types including smartwatches, televisions, smart displays, car kits, and smartphones.\n\nWith the TV you get Honor Magic allowing you to link your phone, and control the TV using it. There’s ability to cast your phone to the screen using DLNA or Miracast standards. The low latency, Huawei say, should allow for screen share gaming from phone to screen. Plus with Huawei Share, one can send a 600MB file in just 20 seconds.\n\nFor a new OS built from the ground up, Huawei’s HarmonyOS is totally ready with a lot of smart features. It is meant to be a full smart hub experience:\n\nYou can make video calls directly from it using the pop-up selfie camera\n\nFace recognition for kids where it sets brightness and reduces blue light emission\n\nBuilt-in YoYo Smart Assistant for voice commands, and setting of routines\n\nVideo bell integration to see who’s at the door.\n\nFamily Message board to share important notices with people in the house\n\nStreaming assistant to help you find streaming platforms for content you want\n\nThe TV is already on sale in China starting at ~$537 for the 16GB variant and $680 for the 32GB model. Of course, it probably won’t be selling outside China any time soon.\n\nI am impressed with Huawei’s work on a brand new OS. I am happy they took the open source road, and I believe they can get more developers on board much faster than other companies like Microsoft who tried and failed. The good thing (or bad, depending on how you view it) is this: If America completely bans Huawei from accessing Android and Windows and other stuff, China can retaliate forcing all Chinese companies to get an alternative, and Huawei has an alternative that’s ready.\n\nRelated\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nHuawei released a TV running HarmonyOS.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

The reality is that mRNA technology remains under-tested, and we are not going to spend taxpayer dollars repeating the mistakes of the last administration, which concealed legitimate safety concerns from the public,\" Nixon said.\n\nHe added that \"the move signals a shift in federal vaccine funding priorities toward platforms with better-established safety profiles and transparent data practices. HHS remains committed to advancing pandemic preparedness through technologies that are evidence-based, ethically grounded, and publicly accountable.\" The official did not provide any additional details.\n\nJennifer Nuzzo, the director of Brown University's Pandemic Center, said the decision was \"disappointing, but unsurprising given the politically-motivated, evidence-free rhetoric that tries to paint mRNA vaccines as being dangerous.\"\n\n\"While there are other means of making flu vaccines in a pandemic, they are slower and some rely on eggs, which may be in short supply,\" Nuzzo added in an email. \"What we learned clearly during the last influenza pandemic is there are only a few companies in the world that make flu vaccines, which means in a pandemic there won't be enough to go around. If the U.S. wants to make sure it can get enough vaccines for every American who wants them during a pandemic, it should invest in multiple types of vaccines instead of putting all of our eggs in one basket.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe cancellation comes even though Moderna says a study involving 300 healthy adults had produced \"positive interim\" results and the company \"had previously expected to advance the program to late-stage development.\"\n\n\"While the termination of funding from HHS adds uncertainty, we are pleased by the robust immune response and safety profile observed in this interim analysis of the Phase 1/2 study of our H5 avian flu vaccine and we will explore alternative paths forward for the program,\" Stéphane Bancel, Moderna's chief executive officer, said in a statement. \"These clinical data in pandemic influenza underscore the critical role mRNA technology has played as a countermeasure to emerging health threats.\"\n\nThe administration's move drew sharp criticism from outside experts.\n\n\"This decision puts the lives and health of the American people at risk,\" said Dr. Ashish Jha, the dean of the Brown School of Public Health, who served as President Biden's COVID-19 response coordinator.\n\n\"Bird Flu is a well known threat and the virus has continued to evolve. If the virus develops the ability to spread from person to person, we could see a large number of people get sick and die from this infection,\" Jha said. \"The program to develop the next generation of vaccines was essential to protecting Americans. The attack by the Administration on the mRNA vaccine platform is absurd.\"\n\nMichael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, agreed.\n\n\"This decision will make our country far less prepared to respond to the next influenza pandemic,\" he said in an email. \"This is a dangerous course to follow.\"\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the H5N1 flu virus has spread to 1,072 dairy herds, more than 173 million poultry, and caused 70 human cases. While the virus has had a high mortality rate in other countries, so far H5N1 has only caused one death in the U.S. and has not shown any signs of spreading easily from one person to another. But infectious disease experts are concerned that the more the virus spreads, the greater the chance it could mutate into a form that would spread from person to person, which would increase the risk of a pandemic.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nThe Italian government called in the military to enforce its lockdown and ordered non-essential businesses to close by March 22.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert at causal reasoning."}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n### CONTEXT\n[Doc 1]\nTitle: From Aggressive Overtures to Sexual Assault: Harvey Weinstein’s Accusers Tell Their Stories\nContent: Two sources close to the police investigation of Weinstein said that they had no reason to doubt Gutierrez’s account of the incident. One of them, a police source, said that the department had collected more than enough evidence to prosecute Weinstein. But the other said that Gutierrez’s statements about her past complicated the case for the office of the Manhattan District Attorney, Cyrus Vance, Jr. After two weeks of investigation, the D.A.’s office decided not to file charges. The office declined to comment on this story but pointed me to its statement at the time: “This case was taken seriously from the outset, with a thorough investigation conducted by our Sex Crimes Unit. After analyzing the available evidence, including multiple interviews with both parties, a criminal charge is not supported.”\n\n“We had the evidence,” the police source involved in the operation told me. “It’s a case that made me angrier than I thought possible, and I have been on the force a long time.”\n\nGutierrez, when contacted for this story, said that she was unable to discuss the incident. Someone close to the matter told me that, after the D.A.’s office decided not to press charges, Gutierrez, facing Weinstein’s legal team, and in return for a payment, signed a highly restrictive nondisclosure agreement with Weinstein, including an affidavit stating that the acts he admits to in the recording never happened.\n\nWeinstein’s use of such settlements was reported by the Times and confirmed to me by numerous people. A former employee with firsthand knowledge of two settlement negotiations that took place in London in the nineteen-nineties recalled, “It felt like David versus Goliath . . . the guy with all the money and the power flexing his muscle and quashing the allegations and getting rid of them.”\n\n6.\n\nThe Times story disclosed a complaint to the Weinstein Company’s office of human resources, filed on behalf of a temporary front-desk assistant named Emily Nestor in December, 2014. Her own account of Weinstein’s conduct is being made public here for the first time. Nestor was twenty-five when she started the job and, after finishing law school and starting business school, was considering a career in the movie industry. On her first day in the position, Nestor said, two employees told her that she was Weinstein’s “type” physically. When Weinstein arrived at the office, he made comments about her appearance, referring to her as “the pretty girl.” He asked how old she was, and then sent all of his assistants out of the room and made her write down her telephone number.\n\nWeinstein told her to meet him for drinks that night. Nestor invented an excuse. When he insisted, she suggested an early-morning coffee the next day, assuming that he wouldn’t accept. He did, and told her to meet him at the Peninsula hotel in Beverly Hills, where he was staying. Nestor said that she had talked with friends in the entertainment industry and employees in the company who had warned her about Weinstein’s reputation. “I dressed very frumpy,” she said.\n\nNestor told me that the meeting was “the most excruciating and uncomfortable hour of my life.” After Weinstein offered her career help, she said, he began to boast about his sexual liaisons with other women, including famous actresses. “He said, ‘You know, we could have a lot of fun,’ ” Nestor recalled. “ ‘I could put you in my London office, and you could work there and you could be my girlfriend.’ ” She declined. He asked to hold her hand; she said no. In Nestor’s account of the exchange, Weinstein said, “Oh, the girls always say no. You know, ‘No, no.’ And then they have a beer or two and then they’re throwing themselves at me.” In a tone that Nestor described as “very weirdly proud,” Weinstein added “that he’d never had to do anything like Bill Cosby.” She assumed that he meant he’d never drugged a woman. “It’s just a bizarre thing to be so proud of,” she said. “That you’ve never had to resort to doing that. It was just so far removed from reality and normal rules of consent.”\n\n“Textbook sexual harassment” was how Nestor described Weinstein’s behavior to me. “It’s a pretty clear case of sexual harassment when your superior, the C.E.O., asks one of their inferiors, a temp, to have sex with them, essentially in exchange for mentorship.” She recalled refusing his advances at least a dozen times. “ ‘No’ did not mean ‘no’ to him,” she said. “I was very aware of how inappropriate it was. But I felt trapped.”\n\nThroughout the breakfast, she said, Weinstein interrupted their conversation to yell into his cell phone, enraged over a spat that Amy Adams, a star in the Weinstein movie “Big Eyes,” was having in the press. Afterward, Weinstein told Nestor to keep an eye on the news cycle, which he promised would be spun in his favor. Later in the day, there were indeed negative news items about his opponents, and Weinstein stopped by Nestor’s desk to be sure that she’d seen them.\n\nBy that point, Nestor recalled, “I was very afraid of him. And I knew how well connected he was. And how if I pissed him off then I could never have a career in that industry.” Still, she told a friend about the incident, and he alerted the company’s office of human resources, which contacted her. (The friend did not respond to a request for comment.) Nestor had a conversation with company officials about the matter but didn’t pursue it further: the officials said that Weinstein would be informed of anything she told them, a practice not uncommon in businesses the size of the Weinstein Company. Several former Weinstein employees told me that the company’s human-resources department was utterly ineffective; one female executive described it as “a place where you went to when you didn’t want anything to get done. That was common knowledge across the board. Because everything funnelled back to Harvey.” She described the department’s typical response to allegations of misconduct as “This is his company. If you don’t like it, you can leave.”\n\nNestor told me that some people at the company did seem concerned. Irwin Reiter, a senior executive who had worked for Weinstein for almost three decades, sent her a series of messages via LinkedIn. “We view this very seriously and I personally am very sorry your first day was like this,” Reiter wrote. “Also if there are further unwanted advances, please let us know.” Last year, just before the Presidential election, he reached out again, writing, “All this Trump stuff made me think of you.” He described Nestor’s experience as part of Weinstein’s serial misconduct. “I’ve fought him about mistreatment of women 3 weeks before the incident with you. I even wrote him an email that got me labelled by him as sex police,” he wrote. “The fight I had with him about you was epic. I told him if you were my daughter he would have not made out so well.” (Reiter declined to comment for this article, but his lawyer, Debra Katz, confirmed the authenticity of the messages and said that Reiter had made diligent efforts to raise these issues, to no avail. Katz also noted that Reiter “is eager to coöperate fully with any outside investigation.”)\n\nThough no assault occurred, and Nestor left after completing her temporary placement, she was profoundly affected by the experience. “I was definitely traumatized for a while, in terms of feeling so harassed and frightened,” she said. “It made me feel incredibly discouraged that this could be something that happens on a regular basis. I actually decided not to go into entertainment because of this incident.”\n\n7.\n\nEmma de Caunes, a French actress, met Weinstein in 2010, at a party at the Cannes Film Festival. A few months later, he asked her to a lunch meeting at the Hôtel Ritz, in Paris. In the meeting, Weinstein told de Caunes that he was going to be producing a movie with a prominent director, that he planned to shoot it in France, and that it had a strong female role. It was an adaptation of a book, he said, but he claimed he couldn’t remember the title. “But I’ll give it to you,” Weinstein said, according to de Caunes. “I have it in my room.”\n\nDe Caunes replied that she had to leave, since she was already running late for a TV show she was hosting—Eminem was appearing on the show that afternoon, and she hadn’t written her questions yet. Weinstein pleaded with her to retrieve the book with him, and finally she agreed. As they got to his room, she received a telephone call from one of her colleagues, and Weinstein disappeared into a bathroom, leaving the door open. She assumed that he was washing his hands.\n\n“When I hung up the phone, I heard the shower go on in the bathroom,” she said. “I was, like, What the fuck, is he taking a shower?” Weinstein came out, naked and with an erection. “What are you doing?” she asked. Weinstein demanded that she lie on the bed and told her that many other women had done so before her.\n\n“I was very petrified,” de Caunes said. “But I didn’t want to show him that I was petrified, because I could feel that the more I was freaking out, the more he was excited.” She added, “It was like a hunter with a wild animal. The fear turns him on.” De Caunes told Weinstein that she was leaving, and he panicked. “We haven’t done anything!” she remembered him saying. “It’s like being in a Walt Disney movie!”\n\nDe Caunes told me, “I looked at him and I said—it took all my courage, but I said, ‘I’ve always hated Walt Disney movies.’ And then I left. I slammed the door.” She was shaking on the stairs going down to the lobby. A director she was working with on the TV show confirmed that she arrived at the studio distraught and that she recounted what had happened. Weinstein called relentlessly over the next few hours, offering de Caunes gifts and repeating his assertion that nothing had happened.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nWomen in media created an anonymously editable Google spreadsheet titled “SHITTY MEDIA MEN” to list men in media and allegations of inappropriate behavior.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

In the chaos, law enforcement officials said, one woman was shot and killed by Capitol Police.\n\nThe violent scene — much of it incited by the president’s incendiary language — was like no other in modern American history, bringing to a sudden halt the congressional certification of Joe Biden’s electoral victory.\n\nWith poles bearing blue Trump flags, a mob that would eventually grow into the thousands bashed through Capitol doors and windows, forcing their way past police officers unprepared for the onslaught. Lawmakers were evacuated shortly before an armed standoff at the House chamber’s entrance. The woman who was shot was rushed to an ambulance, police said, and later died. Canisters of tear gas were fired across the Rotunda’s white marble floor, and on the steps outside the building, rioters flew Confederate flags.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“USA! USA!” chanted the would-be saboteurs of a 244-year-old democracy.\n\nThe Senate stopped its proceedings, and the House doors were closed. In a notification, U.S. Capitol Police said no one would be allowed to come or go from the building as they struggled to regain control. “Stay away from exterior windows, doors. If outside, seek cover,” police warned.\n\nAll 1,100 members of the D.C. National Guard were activated, and Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) imposed a citywide curfew. From 6 p.m. Wednesday to 6 a.m. Thursday, Bowser said, no one other than essential personnel would be allowed outdoors in the city.\n\nThe mob had arrived hours earlier, charging past the metal barricades on the property’s outer edge. Hundreds, then thousands followed them. Some scaled the Capitol’s walls to reach entrances; others climbed over one another.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy day’s end, four people would be dead: one from gunfire and three from medical emergencies that officials have yet to explain.\n\nOn the building’s east side, police initially pushed the pro-Trump demonstrators back but soon gave up and fell back to the foot of the main steps. Within a half-hour, fights broke out again, and police retreated to the top of the stairs as screaming Trump supporters surged closer. After police perimeters were breached, the elated crowd began to sing the national anthem.\n\nFor an hour, they banged on the doors, chanting, “Let us in! Let us in!” Police inside fired pepper balls and smoke bombs into the crowd but failed to turn them away. After each volley, the rioters, who were mostly White men, would cluster around the doors again, yelling, arguing, pledging revolution.\n\nSometime after 2:10 p.m., a man used a clear plastic riot shield to break through the windows on a first floor to the south side of the building, then hopped in with a few others. Once inside, police suspect, rioters opened doors to let in more of their compatriots.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Capitol Police officer yelled from a higher stairway at the intruders, ordering them to stop, but when they didn’t, the officer fired at a man coming at him, two law enforcement officials said. Amid shouts and people rushing to get away from the sound of gunfire, rioters saw a woman in their group collapse. Police believe she was unarmed, a law enforcement official said, but the officer who shot her did not know that. Capitol Police had already been warned by D.C. police that many in the crowds were secretly carrying weapons.\n\n“They shot a girl!” someone yelled as a group of Trump supporters ran out of the southeast entrance.\n\nA team of paramedics with a gurney soon arrived and a Capitol Police officer stepped aside to let them pass. “White female, shot in the shoulder,” the officer said as they hurried past. They emerged minutes later.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the gurney was a woman later identified as Ashli Babbitt. Dressed in jeans, the 35-year-old gazed vacantly to one side, her torso and face covered in blood. Babbitt, a California native and an Air Force veteran, was a staunch supporter of the president.\n\nAs the gurney was loaded into the back of the ambulance, pro-Trump rioters swarmed around it, screaming, “Murderers!”\n\nCapitol Police officers with long guns pushed them back, and the ambulance drove off.\n\nInside, where the lawmakers had donned gas masks kept under their chairs, Rep. Jamie B. Raskin (D-Md.) could only think of his family as he and other lawmakers hid from the mob. Reeling from the loss of his 25-year-old son last week, Raskin had taken one of his daughters and his son-in-law to the Capitol to watch the debates unfold over certification of Biden’s election, he said, “because we wanted to be together.” Raskin was helping lead Democrats’ arguments against Republican objectors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I thought I could show them the peaceful transfer of power in the United States of America,” Raskin told C-SPAN earlier. “What was really going through my mind was their safety because they were not with me in the chamber, and I just wanted us all to get back together.”\n\nRep. Abigail Spanberger (D-Va.) said members were told that chemical irritants had been released in Statuary Hall and, for a moment, braced for the possibility that they would be exposed to tear gas. Capitol Police barricaded the doors with tables and bookshelves.\n\nSpanberger, a former CIA case officer, said that it was a crisis she would only expect to see unfold in fragile, faraway places.\n\n“This is what we see in failing countries,” she said. “This is what leads to a death of democracy.”\n\nThe shooting and the breach triggered an instant call for help across Washington to other law enforcement agencies. At the U.S. Secret Service, headquarters sent out an emergency alert to all gun-carrying Secret Service personnel to report to headquarters in preparation to help secure the Capitol.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, dozens of other rioters streamed into the building, where they smashed windows and vandalized offices amid furious clashes with officers desperate to maintain control.\n\n“MURDER THE MEDIA,” read a message written on one door.\n\n“WE WILL NOT BACK DOWN,” read another left in the office of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who also refused to back down, later directing her colleagues to return and finish validating Biden’s victory.\n\nRep. Karen Bass, a Democrat from California, shared a photo on Twitter of a long-haired man in a Trump hat carrying a rostrum adorned with the gold-colored seal of the speaker.\n\n“Arrest this man,” she demanded.\n\nAt 3:30 p.m., more law enforcement in riot gear arrived at the Capitol.\n\n“Traitors,” Trump supporters shouted. “What’s your oath?”\n\nBiden condemned what he called an “unprecedented assault” on American democracy, “unlike anything we’ve seen in modern times.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“This is not dissent. It’s disorder. It’s chaos,” he said. “It borders on sedition, and it must end now.”\n\nFor hours, Trump made little effort to quell the violence he had helped instigate, finally sharing a video at 4:17 p.m. in which he told people to “go home” — while continuing to promote the falsehood that he had won the election.\n\n“We love you,” he told them. “You’re very special.”\n\nThe Capitol has been the target of violence before. In 1954, Puerto Rican nationalists opened fire from a House gallery, injuring five lawmakers on the floor below. In 1971, a bomb planted by a radical left-wing group exploded, though no one was harmed. In 1998, a gunman opened fire, killing two Capitol Police officers. But not since the British set fire to the Capitol in 1814 has a mob overrun the ultimate symbol of American freedom.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe fallout on Wednesday was immediate, stunning the world, the country and, perhaps most of all, political Washington. Former presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton joined Republican Sen. Mitt Romney (Utah) in denouncing Trump for provoking the mob, while Twitter, Facebook and Instagram all temporarily banned him from their platforms. Several conservative lawmakers who had planned to object to Biden’s certification announced that they had changed their minds.\n\nShortly after 8 p.m., just an hour or so after hundreds of law enforcement officers had at last finished clearing the mob and removing Trump flags left inside the building, heavily armed FBI agents and police officers in riot gear escorted lawmakers back to work.\n\nAs discussion inside the battered building resumed, the sense of fear that had gripped the nation’s capital for much of the day had yet to subside.\n\nFederal agents were investigating a pickup truck found with weapons, ammunition and potential bombmaking material parked outside the Republican National Committee, according to two people familiar with the inquiry who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it. The truck, parked across the street from the party offices and near the entrance to a Metro station, contained rifles and shotguns and a mass of ammunition, these people said. Federal agents were still trying to determine whether that vehicle and its contents are connected to suspected pipe bombs found earlier in the day.\n\nBy late evening, D.C. Police Chief Robert J. Contee III said officers had arrested at least 52 people, including four for carrying pistols without a license, one for possession of a prohibited weapon and 47 for curfew violations and unlawful entry. Along with the pipe bombs, he said, police discovered a cooler packed with molotov cocktails on the Capitol grounds. In total, 14 D.C. officers were injured Wednesday. One was hospitalized after being pulled into a crowd and assaulted, and another received “significant facial injuries” after being hit with a projectile.\n\nJust past sunset, a man was stabbed at 12th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue NW, near Freedom Plaza, but it was unclear whether the attack was related to the assault at the Capitol, a mile east.\n\nThose who had made it inside the building took on a celebrity status when they came back out. A woman who said she had footage on her phone of Capitol Police pointing guns at rioters was circled by dozens who wanted to see it.

The model has rapidly gained popularity, igniting discussions across social media platforms and becoming a trending topic. Users have shared various memes and opinions, praising its capabilities and disruptive impact on the AI industry.\n\nDeepSeek-R1’s associated application has surged in downloads, becoming the most downloaded free AI app on the US Apple App Store. It achieved the top spot in India across all app categories, surpassing major players such as ChatGPT and Google Gemini. Sensor Tower data highlights that the app climbed from rank 102 on January 25 to rank 1 by January 27, maintaining its position the following day.\n\nThe app has also performed exceptionally well in the productivity app category, leaping from rank 132 on January 18 to the top position by January 27, displacing ChatGPT. On Android’s Play Store, DeepSeek-R1 has shown significant improvement, climbing from rank 447 on January 16 to rank 15 by January 28, trailing Google Gemini by just one position.\n\nPowered by a reasoning-based AI model with 670 billion parameters, DeepSeek-R1 stands as the largest open-source language model to date. Experts have drawn comparisons between its performance and OpenAI’s GPT-4, particularly in tasks related to mathematics, coding, and reasoning. What sets DeepSeek apart is its cost-effective development process—while OpenAI reportedly spent over $100 million on GPT-4, DeepSeek achieved similar capabilities for just $6 million by leveraging less advanced hardware combined with Nvidia A100 chips.\n\nBeyond the United States, the app has gained immense popularity worldwide. It has become the most downloaded application in countries such as the UK, Australia, Singapore, and Canada. However, its expansion across Europe has been relatively slower, indicating potential challenges in broader global adoption.\n\nAlso Read :- Nakul Jain Steps Down as Paytm Payments Services CEO\n\nChina’s growing expertise in artificial intelligence is evident in DeepSeek’s success. The company’s rise aligns with Beijing’s strategic focus on transitioning from traditional manufacturing to cutting-edge technologies. Despite international restrictions on advanced chip exports to China, DeepSeek has demonstrated an ability to innovate using available resources, raising questions about the effectiveness of such trade limitations.\n\nLike other AI models developed in China, DeepSeek incorporates safeguards to steer clear of politically sensitive subjects. When prompted about the 1989 Tiananmen Square incident, for instance, the app responded with a disclaimer—reflecting the constraints imposed by government regulations. While this censorship may hinder its acceptance in certain international markets, the model maintains high accuracy in other domains by integrating reliable data sources.\n\nThe rapid ascent of DeepSeek signals a notable shift in the AI industry. By combining affordability, scalability, and advanced reasoning capabilities, the company has emerged as a strong competitor to major industry players. Its rise not only disrupts the global AI landscape but also underscores the increasing influence of Chinese tech startups on the international stage.\n\nBe a part of Elets Collaborative Initiatives.

He died in the crowd surge in Seoul on Saturday.\n\nFor Steve Blesi, an excruciating wait turned into an unimaginable loss.\n\nHis son Steven Blesi was in the area of the crushing crowd surge in Seoul on Saturday night. After the father, who lives in suburban Atlanta, heard the news about the tragedy, he called and texted frantically. He reached out to friends and government officials. And he went on Twitter, imploring anyone with news to come forward.\n\nOver the next three agonizing hours, some people provided what little information they had. Others pledged prayers. All offered hope.\n\n“Is there anything we can do to help?” one asked.\n\n“Please God, return this man’s son to him unharmed,” another said.\n\nI know you must be beside yourself. Praying your son is found just fine. — Leah (@Makeawish3) October 30, 2022\n\nAt 11:30 p.m., Mr. Blesi and his wife received a phone call from the U.S. Embassy in South Korea.\n\n“When they said, ‘Are you two sitting down?’ I knew what the answer was,” he said. His son, 20, a student at Kennesaw State University in Georgia who was about two months into a study abroad program, was one of the Americans who were among the more than 150 people who died in the Halloween celebration in the Itaewon nightlife district in Seoul. (Anne Gieske, a nursing student at the University of Kentucky studying in Seoul this semester, also died, the school said in a statement on Sunday.)\n\n“It was like it stabbed like a hundred million times simultaneously,” Mr. Blesi said, speaking by phone on Sunday as he drove to pick up his older son, Joey Blesi, from college in Alabama. “It was like your world just collapsing. It was numb and devastating all at the same time.”\n\nImage Steven Blesi, left, and his brother, Joey Blesi. They were best friends, their father said.\n\nAs he made the two-hour drive, Mr. Blesi said he could not stop worrying about Joey. Steven was the more outgoing sibling, he said. Joey was shyer, more introverted.\n\n“Steven and him were best friends,” Mr. Blesi said, “I’m just worried to death about him, about how he becomes a whole heart instead of half a heart.”\n\nSteven Blesi had been waiting for years for an opportunity to study abroad, his father said. He had a passion for international business, specifically in East Asia, but the coronavirus pandemic had kept him from traveling there until this fall.\n\n“My wife is Latin, but he did not want to go to Latin America,” Mr. Blesi said, chuckling. “He was actually learning Korean in addition to Spanish. He wanted to speak more languages than my wife.” On Saturday, initial reports suggested that around 20 foreign nationals had been killed but that none of them were from the United States.\n\n“That gave us hope,” Mr. Blesi said.\n\nHe and his wife remained positive even after he tried calling his son repeatedly and someone else — a police officer — finally answered. Steven Blesi’s phone was among the scores of phones littered across the scene of the deadly crowd surge.\n\n“Well, maybe his phone got knocked out of his hand,” Mr. Blesi recalled thinking. “Maybe he lost his phone.”\n\nMr. Blesi was eventually able to piece together what happened to his son after getting in touch with some of his friends in Seoul. He had just finished taking midterm exams, and he and a group of friends were going out Saturday for a night of fun. They eventually found themselves at the Halloween celebration. A few of Steven Blesi’s friends left the gathering to escape the crowds, but he stayed behind.\n\n“I texted him maybe a half-hour before all this happened, and I said: ‘I know you’re out and about. Be safe,’” Mr. Blesi said. “I never got a reply to that.”\n\nBeyond the grief, Mr. Blesi said that he felt rage toward the authorities who he believes allowed this to happen.\n\nThey should not allow crowds to get that big, he said. “I see politicians out there grieving on Twitter,” he said. “It’s just, to me, publicity on their end. Whereas they should be working to try to ensure rules are in place to not allow this type of crowding to ever happen again.”\n\nMr. Blesi and others who knew his son agreed that his defining feature was the compassion he had for others, especially people who were struggling. He was never afraid to stand up for someone in need, Mr. Blesi said. He loved traveling and basketball, and he and his older brother were both Eagle Scouts.\n\n“He was an adventurous spirit and a loving spirit,” Mr. Blesi said. “That’s the only way I know how to describe him. And the loss is just unbearable.”\n\nAfter he posted the confirmation of his son’s death on Twitter, the responses kept coming.\n\n“May he rest in fun-filled, painless places,” one person said.\n\n“Heartbroken,” said another.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nPresident Yoon Suk-yeol declared a period of national mourning and designated Itaewon a disaster zone.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Qassem Soleimani last week, another chapter in the long story of how drones have been used in conflicts in Iraq. Bulletin Illustration. Soleimani photo courtesy of Khamenei.ir (Creative Commons).\n\nThe Iraqi parliament voted to boot US troops from Iraq. Iran announced it would no longer comply with international restrictions on its nuclear program. US President Donald Trump tweeted that the Pentagon would target 52 Iranian sites, including culturally significant ones, if Iran attacked US personnel. And the US secretary of state referred to “this war” with Iran in a television interview.\n\nThat was just Sunday’s news.\n\nThe event that set off that chain reaction? A likely US drone strike near the Baghdad International Airport late last week that killed top Iranian military leader Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani. Although the circumstances are not entirely clear, it appears a US MQ-9 Reaper launched the strike against the general; the attack was the latest chapter in the long story of drone wars in Iraq.\n\nLike neighboring Syria, Iraq today is a hotbed of unmanned aerial activity. Here are five questions (and answers) about military drones in Iraq.\n\nWhen and how were drones first used in conflicts in Iraq? The saga of drone operations in Iraq is a long one. It likely begins during the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s, when Iran began developing the Mohajer-1 surveillance drone and flying it over the frontlines. (This story was later turned into a 1990 film.)\n\nDuring and after the Gulf War, the US military began flying drones over Iraq, marking the first significant US deployment of modern military drones. Iraqi soldiers famously surrendered to a US Navy RQ-2 Pioneer during this conflict.\n\nIn the late 1990s, former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein launched Iraq’s drone development program, which the United States later used as part of the justification for the invasion of Iraq in 2003. During the course of the ensuing Iraq War, the United States began deploying drones in ever greater numbers. Systems like the Raven, Shadow, ScanEagle, and Gray Eagle that today form the backbone of the US drone fleet all made their operational debut during this period.\n\nWho operates drones in Iraq today? The Iraqi military has its own fleet of drones, but it’s not clear how many of these aircraft are active. A US military report last year found that most of Iraq’s US-made ScanEagles were left unused due to a lapse in maintenance, and only one of Iraq’s 10 Chinese-made CH-4s remained viable.\n\nIn all, eight countries—Iran, Iraq, Israel, Italy, Spain, Turkey, the United States, and the United Kingdom—are believed to have operated drones over Iraq over the past year. The United States, the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, and Turkey likely fly missions in Iraq on a regular basis, while Israel, Iraq, and Iran have conducted intermittent operations.\n\nIn addition to national militaries, a number of armed groups in Iraq have unveiled drones of their own since the rise of Islamic State (ISIS), although it’s not clear whether any of these efforts remain active. ISIS, of course, had a robust drone program in Iraq, relying on a number of Chinese-made off-the-shelf hobbyist drones. Several years ago, Iraqi Shi’ite militias, including the Iranian-backed militia that led protests at the US Embassy last week, displayed Iranian-made systems.\n\nWhy are drones flown in Iraq? From Turkish attacks on Kurdish forces to Iran’s support for Iraq’s counter-ISIS fight, drone operations in Iraq reflect the tangled nature of alliances and conflicts in the Middle East. There are three main drivers for why drones are used in Iraq today:\n\nAttacking ISIS. The United States and its allies have deployed drones in support of operations against ISIS. (In the days since Soleimani’s killing, the Pentagon has suspended operations against ISIS in Iraq and Syria.) The United States, the United Kingdom, and Iraq are reported to have carried out drone strikes against ISIS targets, while Italy and Spain have used drones to conduct reconnaissance and to identify targets for Kurdish and other allied forces on the ground. Iran reportedly stood up a small drone unit in Iraq in 2013 or 2014 to support Iraqi counter-ISIS efforts, though it’s unclear how long it remained active.\n\nAttacking Kurdish groups. Turkey and Iran are believed to have launched separate drone operations against Kurdish groups in Iraq. Turkey launched Operation Claw in early 2019 to target Kurdish militant organizations in northern Iraq. According to a Turkish military statement in December, Turkish drone operations in Claw have resulted in the deaths of 174 people. Meanwhile, Iran has reportedly conducted periodic strikes against Kurdish groups along its border in northeastern Iraq. In July, Iran announced that a recently-formed Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps drone unit had participated in a strike against Iraqi Kurdish groups.\n\nCountering Iran. Israel, and now the United States, have used drones to target Iranian-backed militias in Iraq. In July and August last year Israel reportedly conducted several drone strikes targeting elements of the Popular Mobilization Forces—a coalition of Iraqi paramilitary groups—that are aligned with Iran.\n\nWhich drones are flown in Iraq? Look no further than Iraq to get a sense of how drone technology has proliferated in recent years, with a range of countries and firms producing military-grade systems. At least eight different military drones are operated over Iraq. The United States, the United Kingdom, and Italy operate the General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper, the drone that was likely used in the attack on Soleimani. The United States also uses the General Atomics MQ-1C Gray Eagle and, at various points in recent years, the RQ-11 Raven, RQ-20 Puma, RQ-21 Blackjack, and RQ-7 Shadow, as well. Spain flew the Insitu ScanEagle until December, when it was withdrawn and replaced by the Israeli-made Aeronautics Orbiter. Iraq is equipped with the Insitu ScanEagle and Chinese-made CASC CH-4. Turkey operates the Baykar Makina Bayraktar-TB2 and, potentially, the Turkish Aerospace Industries Anka. Iran reportedly deployed a Qods Mohajer-6 in operations against Kurdish militants last year.\n\nWhere are the drones based? Several militaries use bases in Iraq, Kuwait, and Turkey to launch drone missions in Iraq. Al Asad Air Base in western Iraq is host to US Air Force MQ-9 Reapers and Army MQ-1C Gray Eagles. The Spanish Army drone unit is also based at Al Asad. In Kuwait, Ali Al Salem Air Base is host to US, UK, and Italian MQ-9 Reaper contingents. Several airports in southwestern Turkey could host the Turkish drones that conduct operations over Iraq. The Turkish military has established drone outposts at Batman Air Base, Şırnak Airport, Van Airport, and Hakkari Yüksekova Airport. In past years, Iraq’s CH-4s have been located at Balad Air Base and Al Kut Air Base.\n\nIn certain contexts, military drones offer several technical and tactical advantages over manned aircraft, which is why they are an appealing option for the countries involved in the Iraq conflict. As the Soleimani killing illustrates, though, while the decision to use a drone in an attack may be straightforward, the consequences of doing so are anything but.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nOn December 29, US forces conducted airstrikes at five Kataib Hezbollah facilities in Iraq and Syria, killing at least 25 people.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA. In 2015, the U.S. and five other nations signed a nuclear accord with Tehran.\nB. In 2007, U.S. commandos observed a convoy carrying Gen. Qassem Soleimani in northern Iraq.\nC. On December 27, Kataib Hezbollah attacked the K1 military base near Kirkuk, killing an American contractor and wounding American and Iraqi personnel.\nD. During the 1980s Iran-Iraq War, Muhandis fought on the side of Iran.\n\n/You MUST answer based strictly on the instructions:\n### INSTRUCTIONS:\nBased solely on the provided CONTEXT, evaluate each option for the TARGET EVENT.

That process could take at least two years.\n\nBoris Johnson, the former mayor of London who campaigned for the UK’s departure from the EU, is tipped by bookmakers as Cameron’s likely successor.\n\nJohnson, who was greeted by a booing crowd when he left his home on Friday morning, thanked voters for their decision, pledged that the UK would remain committed to Europe and urged unity.\n\n“I think the electorate have searched in their hearts and answered as honestly as they can,” he said. “They have decided to vote to take back control from a European Union that has become too remote.”\n\nFormer PM: There will be costs\n\nFormer British Prime Minister Tony Blair told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer that UK voters would learn over the next 24 months that leaving Europe will not solve their economic troubles, ease their apprehensions or make Britain more independent in a meaningful way.\n\n“I literally cannot think of a big decision that I was not able to take because of Europe,” Blair said. “There is so much anger at the moment that the anger replaces the more rational answers.”\n\nBlair noted that the United States was facing the same type of political fracturing, brought on by economic turmoil, globalization and anger at immigration.\n\n“Getting out of Europe is not the answer,” he said, noting the UK sells half of its goods and services to the EU. “We are going to have to negotiate ourselves back into that market and it will be much more difficult than these people understand.”\n\nPossible Scottish independence vote\n\nIn Scotland, where support was overwhelmingly in favor of remaining in the EU, Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s First Minister and leader of the dominant Scottish National Party, said the outcome threw into doubt the future of her country’s place in the UK.\n\nShe said the Scottish government will begin preparing legislation for a new independence referendum if the Scottish Parliament decides it wants to hold one. Scots voted down a bid for independence from the UK in 2014.\n\n“Democratically unacceptable,” said Sturgeon in describing the fact that Scotland would be pulled out of the European Union despite the majority of the Scottish people voting to stay in.\n\nMORE: What does Brexit mean for you?\n\nSinn Fein calls for Irish unity\n\nThe Sinn Féin party in Northern Ireland called for a referendum on Irish unity, which could take Northern Ireland out of the UK and join it with the Republic of Ireland, an EU member.\n\nVoters in Northern Ireland voted for the UK to remain in the EU.\n\nSinn Féin President Gerry Adams said the Brexit result could portend tougher border rules – with barriers and custom posts – between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, because it will be the only land border between the EU and the UK.\n\nAdams said such a result would be unacceptable given the vote result in Northern Ireland and could undermine the cooperative relationships and that have developed between the two Irelands since the Good Friday agreement.\n\n“My issue is the north of Ireland is going to be dragged out of the EU on the decision made by people on another island,” said Adams, whose political party is dedicated to the reunification of Ireland.\n\n“We’re calling for a poll, a referendum, on Irish unity, on the border. This (the Brexit vote) has the potential to set back the good work that’s been done in terms of the peace process, building harmony, building infrastructure.”\n\n‘Dying’ institution\n\nAs European leaders faced their own crises, German Chancellor Angela Merkel stressed the “need to make sure that European people feel that the EU wants to improve all our lives.”\n\nShe said she greatly regretted the UK’s decision, but added, “The EU is strong enough to find the right answers today.”\n\nFrench President Francois Hollande called it a “painful choice which I deeply regret for the UK and Europe.”\n\nItaly’s finance minister, Pier Carlo Padoan, warned of a domino effect amid calls for further exit votes.\n\nFar-right Dutch politician Geert Wilders congratulated the UK on its decision and called for a Dutch referendum on EU membership.\n\n“We want to be in charge of our own country, our own money, our own borders and our own immigration policy,” he was quoted as saying in a statement on his website.\n\nMarine Le Pen, the leader of France’s National Front party who plans to run for the French presidency next year, also congratulated the Brexit side.\n\nHer party has suggested the French will also hold an “out” referendum if she assumes the presidency.\n\nPassions continued to run high in the UK in the hours after the vote, with UK Independence Party (UKIP) leader and Leave campaigner Nigel Farage declaring the EU a “dying” institution.\n\n“We’ve given ourselves the chance to rejoin the world,” he told journalists. “June 23rd needs to become a national bank holiday and we will call it Independence Day.”\n\nU.S. President Barack Obama said that while the UK’s relationship with Europe was changing, the ties that bound the UK to the United States and the United States to Europe would remain.\n\n“I do think yesterday’s vote speaks to ongoing changes and challenges that are raised by globalization, but the UK’s relationship with the EU will change. What will not change is the special relationship that exists between our two nations,” Obama said. “That will endure. And the EU will remain one of our indispensable partners.”\n\nMORE: Full coverage of the UK referendum\n\nNATO: UK will stay a strong ally\n\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg voiced reassurances that the United Kingdom will remain a strong and committed NATO ally despite the vote.\n\n“Today, as we face more instability and uncertainty, NATO is more important than ever as a platform for cooperation among European allies and between Europe and North America,” said Stoltenberg. “A strong, united and determined NATO remains an essential pillar of stability in a turbulent world and a key contributor to international peace and security.”\n\nVoters react\n\nThe referendum followed one of the most divisive political campaigns in recent memory. Polls consistently showed voters split down the middle, with the outcome too close to call ahead of the vote.\n\nNews of the decision sparked strong emotions, with those in favor and those against reflecting on a campaign marred by allegations of lies, distrust and hate.\n\n“This is so sad,” said Daniel Trilling on Twitter. “Millions of people aren’t going to feel any more in control of their lives or their country because of this vote.”\n\n“People vote on emotion,” Twitter user @cemanthe posted. “This was won on false promises and emotive texts about immigration. Not on facts.”\n\n“I am SO happy this morning,” wrote another, Gemma.\n\nAn online petition calling for a second referendum gathered more than 120,000 signatures within hours of being posted.\n\nLeading political figures gave mixed reactions.\n\nTony Blair, the former UK prime minister, called the decision a divided result.\n\n“It’s going to be a complicated process but it’s important to bring our country together and stabilize our country,” he told CNN’s Becky Anderson. “It’s still a resilient country and it’s a strong country.”\n\nSadiq Khan, the mayor of largely pro-EU London, said the decision was a “clear message” and urged calm.\n\n‘Taking back control’\n\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk said the decision was “historic, but not a moment for hysterical reactions.”\n\nDonald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee in the U.S. presidential election, hailed the UK’s decision to “reassert control over their own politics, borders and economy.”\n\nIn a news conference Friday as he attended the official opening of a remodeled golf resort bearing his name in Turnberry, Scotland, Trump called the decision of the voters “a great thing.”\n\n“They’re angry over borders, they’re angry over people coming into the country and taking over. Nobody even knows who they are,” he said. “They’re angry about many, many things. They took back control of their country.”\n\nUKIP’s Farage told CNN’s Nima Elbagir that the economic fears in the wake of the EU departure were overstated, and that he expected an even better relationship with the United States. He said the vote was a repudiation of bullying tactics by corporate and political powers to keep the UK in the EU.\n\n“(We were) threatened by everybody that if we didn’t stay part of this political union, dreadful things would happen to us, and what happened were the little people, the regular people, the ordinary people said, ‘No, this is wrong,’” Farage said.\n\n“When you really think about it, what we’ve done isn’t actually that radical. … We want to be a democratic nation. We want to make our own laws in our own parliament, have our own supreme court, and control our own border. If you think about, there’s now 183 countries around the world that have independence days. What we did yesterday was become 184th.”\n\nOpinion: Why Brexit vote should worry Trump\n\nMarkets plunge\n\nThe effects of the vote outcome were immediately felt in markets and economies around the world.\n\nIn New York, the Dow ended the day down more than 611 points, to close at 17,399. London’s FTSE index shed $164 billion of its value in the first 10 minutes of trading, but regained ground later in the day.\n\nThe NASDAQ index fell more than 4% and into a correction, or down 10% from recent highs.\n\nThe British pound at one point plunged more than 12% to below $1.34, its lowest level since 1985. Japan’s Nikkei tanked 6.7% and Hong Kong’s main index dropped 3.7%.\n\nBank of England Governor Mark Carney said the body is “well prepared” and “won’t hesitate” to take additional measures as markets adjust.\n\nThe “UK financial system is resilient,” he added.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nGlobal markets plunged following the Brexit vote.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

There are obviously many, many people coming in with injuries,” he said.\n\nKumar added that he understands the Mandalay hospital is out of power and water. “Their capacity to be able to treat patients would be limited now, which is really sad,” he said.\n\nMeanwhile a seismologist told CNN that the powerful 7.7-magnitude quake that rocked Myanmar is like a “great knife cut into the Earth.”\n\nJames Jackson, from the University of Cambridge in England, said the earthquake was caused by a rupture that lasted for “a full minute,” causing sideways movements on the ground.\n\n“Think of a piece of paper tearing, and it tears at about two kilometers per second,” he said. “It’s moving a fault, which is like a great knife cut in the Earth.”\n\nHe said while Bangkok doesn’t have earthquakes, its tall buildings make the city particularly vulnerable to distant tremors.\n\nFabrice Cotton, a seismologist at the GFZ Center, told CNN that the earthquake was comparable in size to one that struck Turkey in 2023. More than 55,000 people are thought to have been killed in Turkey and Syria during that disaster.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nBy April 3, 2025, the death toll from the earthquake reached 4,390 in Myanmar, with over 5,490 injured.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

The Global Times on Saturday talked to the company and several AI industrial observers to illustrate the phenomenon behind.\"China's cheap, open AI model DeepSeek thrills scientists,\" Nature wrote three days after a large language model called DeepSeek-R1 was released by the Chinese company on January 20. Its performance on certain tasks in chemistry, mathematics and coding is on par with that of OpenAI's o1, the Nature report said.\"How China's new AI model DeepSeek is threatening US dominance,\" a CNBC report on Friday emphasized concerns over DeepSeek's impact on US dominance in AI. It wrote that \"a little-known AI lab out of China has ignited panic throughout Silicon Valley after releasing AI models that can outperform America's best despite being built more cheaply and with less-powerful chips.\"A New York Times report wrote \"The company built a cheaper, competitive chatbot with fewer high-end computer chips than US behemoths like Google and OpenAI, showing the limits of chip export control,\" in a report titled \"How Chinese AI Start-Up DeepSeek Is Competing With Silicon Valley Giants.\"Attention on the Hangzhou-based startup began in December of last year following the launch of its large-scale AI model, \"DeepSeek-V3.\" This new model quickly gained traction among AI enthusiasts, sparking discussions that transcended borders and made their way to international social media platforms and tech forums.As of press time, there was no official response from the team, which media widely seen as \"a mysterious team\" that rarely spoke to media and overtly present themselves.When asked to comment on the external attention surrounding DeepSeek's development of a free, open-source large language model on Saturday, DeepSeek informed the Global Times that it could not provide additional information at this time. They recommended referring to the technical report for a better understanding of its model.According to a notice released by DeepSeek in an open communication group, the company stated that it \"does not engage in external project cooperation, nor does it provide privatization deployment and related support services.\" Additionally, DeepSeek emphasized that it will concentrate on research and development to develop more advanced models, encouraging everyone to \"please look forward to it.\"\"DeepSeek's technological approach challenges the US's dominance and monopoly in AI technology, proving that US' chip restrictions have been ineffective,\" Li Baiyang, an associate professor of intelligence studies with Nanjing University, told the Global Times on Saturday, in explanation why DeepSeek has ignited wide attention from not only China but the Silicon Valley in the US.The US is currently seeking to uphold its dominance in the field of artificial intelligence through various policies and administrative regulations, with a focus on safeguarding its edge in computational and algorithmic capabilities, the expert said.Tian Feng, former dean of the Intelligence Industry Research Institute at Chinese AI software giant SenseTime, described DeepSeek's ability to achieve impressive generative results with lower training costs, along with its complete open-source approach to technology and foundational models as a move likely to \"redefine the development rules for AI.\"It demonstrates comparable advantages to OpenAI's o1 model, along with a training cost of only about $6 million for its V3 model— about one-tenth of what Meta invests in comparable AI models, Tian told the Global Times on Saturday.NVIDIA Senior Research Manager Jim Fan said on X that \"We are living in a timeline where a non-US company is keeping the original mission of OpenAI alive - truly open, frontier research that empowers all. \"According to an anonymous post on Teamblind, a forum for verified Big Tech employees, Meta's AI department is feeling the pressure, according to a report by media outlet The Decoder. The post wrote that Meta is \"in panic mode. Engineers are moving frantically to dissect DeepSeek and copy anything and everything we can from it.\"Meta's Mark Zuckerberg took to Facebook recently to outline his company's response, saying that in 2025, Meta aims to develop an AI assistant that can serve more than a billion people. \"This will be a defining year for AI,\" Zuckerberg wrote, according to the The Decoder report.The approach taken by the Chinese tech start-up has put unprecedented pressure on US AI companies, as it is likely to attract more users and developers globally to participate in high-end AI development, which may weaken the market share and influence of American AI companies, according to Tian.The US stringent measures guard against China in the field of AI, covering various aspects such as chips, talent, computing power, algorithms, and data, and it can be said that \"no means are being spared in their sanctions,\" Li Baiyang said.However, how China's AI innovates testifies its minimal impact, instead, such restrictions have caused many American companies to miss opportunities for collaborative development with China's industrial innovation, Li Baiyang said.The New York Times, as mentioned above, left the question of China-US competition in AI open-ended. It wrote that \"If the best open source technologies come from China, they argue, US developers will build their systems atop those technologies. In the long-run, China could emerge as a central player in AI innovation globally.\"Li Baiyang said DeepSeek's open-source technological route applications embody China's inclusive and accessible mindset, which is of great significance for strengthening the ecosystem of China's AI industry.\"China can achieve significant breakthroughs by pursuing our own path, as long as we continue to innovate,\" Tian said.US President Donald Trump recently announced a $500 billion AI infrastructure investment in the US. Three top tech firms will create a new company, called Stargate, to grow artificial intelligence infrastructure in the US, according to CNN.The healthy competition between China and the US in AI depends on the US attitude. As the two leading powers in the global AI field, China and the US compete in the AI industry, but there is also significant room for cooperation, especially in AI governance, Li Baiyang added.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nDeepSeek released its large language model, DeepSeek-R1, on January 20.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

The popular district in Seoul was hosting Halloween celebrations that drew around 100,000 people when the crowd surge began. Many were attempting to gather in a narrow alley filled with bars and restaurants, according to local media.\n\nVideos have popped up online showing the sheer mass of people crowded into at least one tight street lined with bars and restaurants. Some people can be heard screaming, and most appear completely unable to move.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nOne worker at an Itaewon club, located at the uphill end of the roughly 11-foot-wide alley leading to the district's main street, recalled to reporters seeing the crowd of revelers surge on Saturday night.\n\n\"We could hear some people in the crowd saying, don't push, but someone in the back said, hey, push! Push! And people started screaming, and the crowd poured in toward our club,\" he said.\n\nThe man, who declined to give his name to reporters, said they would ordinarily not let minors into their club, but they opened their doors to try to save lives.\n\n\"But even after we did that, there were people collapsed at the entrance, and some passed out,\" he added. \"We tried to rescue them, but our club was at the end of the surge and there were already three or four layers of people piled on, so we couldn't.\"\n\nHe said his inability to help people \"keeps haunting me, and pains me.\"\n\nOther videos shared on social media show several people, some clad in their Halloween costumes, attempting CPR on rows of victims unconscious on sidewalks.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Chung Sung-Jun/Getty Images Chung Sung-Jun/Getty Images\n\nSurvivors struggle to locate friends\n\nMost of the dead had been identified by mid-morning on Sunday. The task was simplified by the fact that Korean citizens over the age of 17 are required to submit fingerprints to authorities.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nKoreans and foreign nationals who are missing friends and relatives came to a nearby community center to try to identify pictures of the victims.\n\nPark Kang-hyun, 26, traveled to Seoul from Gwangju city, in the country's southwest, in search of two missing friends. One lost her cell phone but survived, he said. The other remains missing.\n\nThe friend who survived said \"there were just too many people. They didn't even have a moment to feel scared. Everyone just fell down.\"\n\nHe continued to search for his other friend, but city officials \"just told me to wait. There's nothing we can do now.\"\n\nNathan Taverniti, 24, was on vacation from Australia. He told reporters he was in Itaewon with three friends.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Chung Sung-Jun/Getty Images Chung Sung-Jun/Getty Images\n\n\"I was there the whole night. Some people fell in front of me, and I lost a group of my friends,\" he said. \"Somehow, I got out, but all three of my friends ... two are in hospital, and one has passed away,\" he said, fighting back tears.\n\n\"There was no police. There was nobody to help me,\" he said. \"It was just me and other bystanders. And I couldn't do anything.\"\n\nIn the aftermath of the crowd surge, questions have begun to surface over whether more police should've been dispatched to the area to help control the large crowds. The Korea Herald reports that emergency crews nearby had trouble getting to the scene and to the hundreds of victims given the crowds and added traffic congestion.\n\nInterior Minister Lee Sang-min has pushed back against the idea more could've been done to prevent the tragedy, according to The Korea Herald. The outlet quotes Lee saying that the crush did not seem to be \"an incident that could have been prevented by deploying more police or fire officers.\"\n\nThe Halloween event had been held before and according to local media reports there was no concern that crowds would be a particular problem this year or any larger than previous events had been.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nTwo Americans are among the dead\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Lee Jin-man/AP Lee Jin-man/AP\n\nAt least two U.S. citizens were among those killed in the deadly crowd surge, the U.S. embassy in Seoul has confirmed.\n\n\"I am deeply saddened by the loss of so many lives last night, to include two young Americans celebrating alongside their Korean friends and others from around the world,\" U.S. Ambassador to the Republic of Korea Philip Goldberg said in a statement.\n\nIn a statement on Twitter, President Biden also offered his condolences.\n\n\"Jill and I are devastated to learn that at least two Americans are among so many who lost their lives in Seoul. Our hearts go out to their loved ones in this time of grief, and we continue to pray for the recovery of all who were injured,\" the president said.\n\nOne of those individuals who died was University of Kentucky student Anne Gieske, the school announced Sunday. Gieske was a junior nursing student from Northern Kentucky who was studying in South Korea as part of an education abroad program.\n\nTwo other students and a faculty member, who are also in South Korea for the semester, were contacted and are confirmed to be safe, the university said.\n\n\"We will be there for those in our community who knew and loved Anne. We also have nearly 80 students from South Korea at UK — members of our community — who will need our support,\" Eli Capilouto, the university's president said in a statement to the school community.\n\nAs of 9 p.m. Sunday local time, officials say at least 26 foreign nationals were killed in the incident, according to local media reports.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Seoul is working with local authorities and providing consular assistance to any U.S. citizens affected, a spokesman told NPR.\n\nIn response to the tragedy, South Korea Prime Minister Han Duck-soo announced a period of national mourning to last until midnight on Nov. 5.\n\nThe government has declared Seoul's Yongsan district, where Itaewon is located, a special disaster area.

Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said Tuesday that the release of more than 1 million metric tons of wastewater — equivalent to more than 500 Olympic-size swimming pools — will take place in a safe manner.\n\n“We expect the discharge to begin on Aug. 24 if weather and sea conditions do not hinder it,” Kishida said after a cabinet meeting in Tokyo, asking the plant’s operator, Tokyo Electric Power Co., to prepare for the release.\n\nJapan said it will send treated radioactive water from Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant into the Pacific Ocean on Aug. 24, despite local and global opposition. (Video: Naomi Schanen/The Washington Post)\n\nAfter a two-year review, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) concluded last month that Japan’s plan meets international safety standards and would have “negligible” radiological impact on people and the environment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“The government is committed to taking full responsibility until the disposal of the treated water is completed, even if it takes decades to complete,” Kishida said Tuesday.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe water, filtered to remove radioactive elements and highly diluted to lower the concentration of tritium, will be released into the Pacific Ocean in a process expected to take more than 30 years. The concentration of tritium, a radioactive material that is extremely difficult to separate from water, will drop to background ocean levels after the dilution, Japanese authorities say.\n\nFor years, the contaminated water has been stored in large metal tanks near the plant, the site of one of the worst nuclear disasters in history. But Japan is running out of space to build more tanks to accommodate the contaminated groundwater and rainwater that are still exiting the site.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStarting Thursday, the treated water will be discharged at a maximum rate of 132,000 gallons a day through an underwater tunnel off the coast of Japan. External observers, including the IAEA, will monitor the release process.\n\nThe IAEA said Tuesday that it will maintain “its impartial, independent, and objective safety review during the discharge phase.” The agency, which has an office at the plant, said it will continue to assess the relevant activities and publish independent data.\n\nDespite such assurances, environmental groups have questioned the safety of releasing the contaminated water and urged Tokyo to drop the plan.\n\n“Instead of engaging in an honest debate about this reality, the Japanese government has opted for a false solution — decades of deliberate radioactive pollution of the marine environment — during a time when the world’s oceans are already facing immense stress and pressures,” said Shaun Burnie, senior nuclear specialist at Greenpeace East Asia.\n\nThe pending discharge has been highly politicized by neighboring countries. China has been adamantly opposed to the release, which comes at a time of heightened geopolitical tensions between Tokyo and Beijing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“China has pointed out on many occasions that ocean discharge is not the safest or most prudent option to dispose of the nuclear-contaminated water. Japan simply chose it to lower economic costs,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said Monday. “This will pose unnecessary risks to neighboring countries and the rest of the world,” he said, urging Japan to call off the plan.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe plan has also ignited debates in South Korea, which has banned seafood imports from the Fukushima area, even though South Korea’s own assessment of the water-release plan also found it meets international standards.\n\nA senior South Korean government official said Tuesday that Seoul does not necessarily support Japan’s wastewater plan but sees “no scientific or technical problems.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“If the actual discharge deviates from the plan, even just a little bit, we will deem it a threat to the safety and health of our people, and immediately ask Japan to stop,” said Park Gu-yeon, vice minister of government policy coordination.\n\nBut opposition politicians have raised concerns that South Korean waters may be affected by the release, accusing President Yoon Suk Yeol of overlooking the health risks to mend diplomatic ties with Tokyo.\n\n“The Yoon Suk Yeol administration is turning a blind eye to Japan’s dumping of nuclear-contaminated water into the sea,” said Kang Sun-woo, a spokeswoman for the main opposition Democratic Party.\n\nFukushima’s fishing and agricultural industries are also worried about potential reputational harm for their products, which still carry the stigma of radioactive exposure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Our position has not changed and we continue to be opposed,” Masanobu Sakamoto, head of the National Federation of Fisheries Cooperative Associations, said Monday after meeting with Kishida.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n“Our understanding about the safety of the treated water has deepened, but scientific safety and safety from a social point is different. Once the water is released, there will be reputational damage,” he said.\n\nFishing season in Fukushima is due to start Sept. 1, and the Japanese government has pledged to monitor the water quality and collect data every day following the release.\n\nIn Tokyo, about 230 people gathered in front of the prime minister’s office Tuesday to protest the plan, holding signs and chanting slogans such as “Listen to the fishermen” and “The release will impact future generations.”\n\nAccording to a recent Kyodo News poll, 88.1 percent of respondents expressed concern that the release will hurt Japan’s image abroad. The Japanese government has said it will allocate $200 million to compensate the fishing industry for any reputational impact, and $340 million to mitigate the impact on the local economy.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nThe IAEA will maintain an on-site presence for the duration of the release.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Here’s what you need to know\nContent: CNN —\n\nMyanmar’s military seized power of the Southeast Asian country in a coup on Monday, after detaining the country’s civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi and numerous other top government figures.\n\nIn a television address, the army announced that power had been handed to the commander-in-chief of the armed forces, and that it was declaring a national state of emergency for one year.\n\nSuu Kyi and several state ministers are being detained in the capital Naypyidaw, according to a spokesman for the governing National League for Democracy (NLD).\n\nAn armed military soldier stands guard in front of the regional government office in Yangon, Myanmar, on February 1. Lynn Bo Bo/EPA-EFE-Shutterstock\n\nThe move comes after months of increasing friction between the civilian government and the powerful military, known as the Tatmadaw, over alleged election irregularities.\n\nThe two bodies have attempted to share power since the 2015 elections, Myanmar’s first openly contested poll since the end of military rule. That power sharing relationship now appears to be over following Monday’s coup.\n\nHere’s what you need to know about the situation.\n\nWho is Suu Kyi? What is Myanmar’s political system?\n\nSuu Kyi was once celebrated as an international democracy icon. A former political prisoner, she spent 15 years under house arrest as part of a decades-long struggle against military rule.\n\nHer release in 2010 and subsequent election victory five years later were lauded by Western governments as landmark moments in the country’s transition to democratic rule after 50 years of the military regime.\n\nHowever, despite embarking on some democratic reforms and installing a quasi-civilian government under General Thein Sein in 2011, Myanmar’s military was not keen to relinquish their power. The ruling junta drafted a constitution in 2008 that made sure the military would continue to wield significant political and economic influence, regardless of future administrations.\n\nUnder this constitution, the military is allocated a quarter of seats in parliament and it retains control of key ministries like home affairs and defense. The military also has veto power on any attempts to amend the constitution.\n\nIt’s within this framework that Suu Kyi and the NLD first formed a government in 2015. She was elected to office under the title of state counsellor – which had been invented as a loophole, since the military-drafted constitution barred her from becoming President.\n\nAllegations of genocide against the Rohingya\n\nAfter her 2015 victory, Suu Kyi’s tenure was quickly marred by difficulties in making real progress with the peace process that aimed to end the country’s many ethic civil wars.\n\nSuu Kyi also came under fire internationally for failing to speak out against numerous atrocities allegedly carried out by the military against Rohingya Muslims in western Rakhine state. Hundreds of thousands of the persecuted ethnic minority were forced out of western Myanmar into neighboring Bangladesh during violent military operations in 2016 and 2017.\n\nSuu Kyi has repeatedly denied these charges, siding with military and labeling the accusations “misinformation.”\n\nHer government and the military are now facing a genocide investigation at the International Court of Justice.\n\nHowever, domestically she remained popular, especially among the Bamar ethnic majority. In November 2020 the NLD won another resounding victory at the polls, awarding Suu Kyi a second term.\n\nWhat triggered the coup?\n\nMonday’s crackdown is centered around November’s parliamentary election.\n\nThe military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP) performed dismally in the poll, prompting the party to demand a new vote, claiming bias and “unfair campaigning.”\n\nThe military also repeatedly disputed the election results. It claims, without providing evidence, that there are more than 10.5 million cases of “potential fraud, such as non-existent voters” and called on the election commission to publicly release the final polling data.\n\nLast week, a military spokesperson warned it would “take action” if the dispute wasn’t settled, and refused to rule out staging a coup.\n\nThe election commission has denied there is widespread voter fraud.\n\nBut the threat of military intervention prompted international leaders, including the United Nations Secretary-General to voice concern – and the military appeared to back down, claiming that its comments had been misinterpreted.\n\nBy Monday, it became clear that the military had seized power in a coup.\n\nWhat’s the situation on the ground? What’s next?\n\nSuu Kyi, the President, and other cabinet members are being detained in their official residences, according to a spokesperson for the NLD. Suu Kyi is “feeling well” and walking around her home, said the spokesperson.\n\nMyanmar’s first Vice President and former general Myint Swe was installed as the country’s acting President on Monday.\n\nIn its television address, the army said it had detained Suu Kyi and other political leaders for failing to take action over unfounded election fraud and had declared a state of emergency for one year. Power was transferred to the commander-in-chief Min Aung Hlaing, who will carry out an investigation into voting irregularities, according to the announcement.\n\nJustifying the coup, the military cited a section of the constitution that said in the event of a state of emergency, as is the case now, the commander-in-chief has the constitutional right to “take over and exercise State sovereign power.”\n\nLater on Monday, the military said it will hold a “free and fair” election after the election commission has been “re-constituted” and the voter lists have been investigated, and will return power to the winning party. It did not specify when the elections would be held.\n\nIt’s hard to say what will come next, especially since there has been widespread disruption in internet and news access across the country – which could affect the ability of people to get information or organize any response via social media.\n\nNetblocks, which monitors internet blackouts around the world, said that real-time network data showed a major drop in connectivity in the early hours of Monday morning. At one point, the only operational TV channel was the Myanmar military-owned television network Myawaddy TV.\n\nBanks across the country were also temporarily shut down, with operations ceased until the internet connection improves, according to a statement from the Myanmar Bank Association.\n\nDoctors at several hospitals across the country have pledged to go on strike from Wednesday, to protest the coup.\n\nWhat have world leaders said?\n\nWorld leaders and international organizations were quick to voice alarm and concern.\n\nThe United Nations Security Council will discuss Myanmar in private consultations Tuesday morning, according to its latest schedule, which has been updated following the coup.\n\nUS President Joe Biden called on Myanmar’s military leaders to “immediately relinquish the power they have seized, release the activists and officials they have detained, lift all telecommunications restrictions, and refrain from violence against civilians.”\n\nBiden threatened to review sanctions on Myanmar, saying the US removed sanctions over the past decade based on progress toward democracy. “The reversal of that progress will necessitate an immediate review of our sanction laws and authorities, followed by appropriate action,” Biden said in a statement.\n\nOther countries, including Canada, India, Japan, the UK, New Zealand and Australia, have also released statements calling for de-escalation and the release of those detained.\n\nAustralia on Monday called for the immediate release of Suu Kyi and other senior leaders who are being detained by the military.\n\nIn a statement, Marise Payne the Minister of Foreign Affairs said, “The Australian Government is deeply concerned at reports the Myanmar military is once again seeking to seize control of Myanmar.”\n\n“We call on the military to respect the rule of law, to resolve disputes through lawful mechanisms, and to release immediately all civilian leaders and others who have been detained unlawfully,” the statement said.\n\nIndonesia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs also expressed concern, saying in a statement that it urged “all parties in Myanmar to exercise self-restraint and put forth dialogue in finding solutions to challenges so as not to exacerbate the condition.”\n\nIn the Thai capital of Bangkok, protesters gathered outside Myanmar’s embassy on Monday. Video from Reuters showed some demonstrators burning a picture of Myanmar’s army chief.\n\nMyanmar shares a border with Thailand, which experienced a coup in 2014 when its military overthrew the government.\n\nUK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in a tweet Monday, “I condemn the coup and unlawful imprisonment of civilians, including Aung San Suu Kyi, in Myanmar. The vote of the people must be respected and civilian leaders released.”\n\nMeanwhile, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said they are “learning more about the situation” and that China is “a friendly neighbor of Myanmar, and we hope that all parties in Myanmar will properly handle their differences under the constitutional and legal framework and maintain political and social stability.”\n\n“The military’s actions show utter disdain for the democratic elections held in November and the right of Myanmar’s people to choose their own government,” said Brad Adams, Asia director of the international NGO Human Rights Watch, in a statement. “We urge concerned governments to speak out forcefully against the military’s actions and consider targeted sanctions against those responsible.”\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story incorrectly spelled Aung San Suu Kyi's name in the headline.

It's a new day.\n\nThe campaign started for me up the far north coast of NSW and I was deployed to Casino, twice to Port Macquarie, and also Tamworth. I've been to Ulladulla on the south coast twice, as well as several local Sydney fires. Then two deployments of a week each time to the Blue Mountains.\n\nMy role is to lead a strike team of four fire trucks and about 15 firefighters.\n\nI was most recently based out of Lithgow in the Blue Mountains, working around Katoomba, Bilpin, Clarence Town, Dargan and the Bells Line of Road area.\n\nThe conditions we faced were the most trying I've ever experienced.\n\nI needed to prepare the crew for what was ahead, what the day would hold for us, without going over the top. You've got to keep calm. I'm not trying to scare them.\n\nBut up in the Blue Mountains last week there was no easy way to tell the crews that some of the conditions that we were going to face that week were probably as bad as it gets. The conditions we experienced simply couldn't have been any worse.\n\n## The adrenaline kicks in\n\nA typical day starts very early, around 6:30 in the morning. We eat breakfast together and I receive a briefing at the fire control centre. My team meets at a staging location and I explain our objectives for the day.\n\nYou feel a little fresher each morning after a decent sleep and something to eat. Then a little adrenaline kicks in and probably a little fear mixed in, as well.\n\nA lot of our work is community engagement and giving clear and consistent safety messages. We need to know if residents have a bushfire plan, what is the plan if they need to be evacuated, is their house prepared or is their plan to leave.\n\nOn Thursday morning last week weather conditions were classed as catastrophic. The temperature was estimated to reach into the low 40s. Humidity was very, very low, under 10 per cent, and we had strong westerly winds.\n\nMy crew is a mix of full-time and part-time firefighters. They are really professional in that they know what protective equipment to wear and they know how to operate as firefighters.\n\nBut when you face that situation of a fire front hitting a township where people are still living it puts a lot of pressure on the crews and particularly myself. I had to constantly check the way I communicated to make sure I wasn't too overwhelmed.\n\n## We waited, then it hit\n\nThe air that Thursday wasn't too bad at first because it was blowing away from us.\n\nWe got a call in the afternoon to say the fire had picked up.\n\nFire activity increased a lot right across the fire ground on top of the mountain, and as we approached in the truck you could see a plume of black smoke coming out from behind the ridge. It was huge.\n\nWhen we pulled up, the fire front had reached the rear of properties in Clarence Town. We were faced with an intense and active fire front near Bells Line of Road.\n\nAs we approached we could hear it.\n\nFire is loud, it makes a roar like a jet and is so powerful it generates its own wind.\n\nThen all of a sudden the wind stopped and the fire seemed to take a pause. The black smoke wasn't pushing out so intensely.\n\nWe waited. Then, it hit.\n\n## From day to night\n\nThe wind picked up and all around us went black. It was like night time.\n\nThere were a number of occasions on Saturday when the fire came over the top of us like that. It goes from daytime to nearly night time. It becomes very, very dark, very, very quickly.\n\nThe wind changed and was blowing in our direction and so the plumes of black smoke block out the light.\n\nThe darkness is a warning that the flames are just behind.\n\nLoading...And so from that very black and dark atmosphere, the next thing you see are the flames. That day we faced flames up to 30 metres high. That was the sign that the fire front had burst out of the trees and was impacting the township.\n\nThe air was sucked into the fire and the wind increased, so it felt like we had been hit by a thunderstorm.\n\nIt was an intense experience for the crew and for myself, to be honest.\n\nBecause there is so much smoke getting pushed through in all directions visibility remains quite low.\n\nThere are a lot of embers being blown in your direction and that adds another element of risk.\n\nIt's scary in a way and particularly for me, as I had a large crew of firefighters to look after. I knew where they were but I couldn't see them.\n\nI had instructed our teams to wear their breathing apparatus. It was about understanding that they were in a safe refuge while the fire front moved over us and being confident that their training would kick in.\n\n## 'You didn't know which way to turn'\n\nWe have full-time and volunteer firefighters. It was a very difficult situation for the team to face.\n\nWe ended up with a range of spot fires around the place and it was almost like you didn't know which way to turn. You didn't know which house to protect, which fire to put out first.\n\nThe teams got to work very, very quickly.\n\nMany houses still had local residents in their homes. It was too late for them to leave so we had to protect them as well finding places in their houses for them to shelter.\n\nThat's where our training comes in. It was important to pause and remind ourselves not to become overwhelmed.\n\nMy job was to instruct the crews where to set up.\n\nTo be honest the conditions were so bad that we couldn't protect the houses, we couldn't do much firefighting. About 50 homes were lost that day.\n\nIt's hard to explain to communities that our number one priority is your life when they are quite concerned about their houses.\n\nI understand that but when your access routes in and out are blocked, and this is what we were faced with, then we had no choice but to stay in place and protect them until the situation calmed down.\n\nOur job was to protect the lives of the people who were there, and our own to be honest.\n\n## 'We were overrun'\n\nLoading...We had done reconnaissance in the days before the fire hit. We had door knocked and spoken to local residents. We knew a lot of them wanted to stay even though we advised them to leave if they could.\n\nWe knew what properties were defendable and which were not, because we had that situational awareness.\n\nThere were a number of times our crews got over-run and we had to find safe refuge and wait for the fire front to pass before going back in.\n\nI was aware of where my team was, but residents were free to move around and many did.\n\nI was very concerned that we were potentially going to lose a number of lives up there on Saturday.\n\nThankfully that didn't happen.\n\n## 'We were expecting it'\n\nIt is unusual to have the sort of consistent bad fire conditions, drying conditions, that we are facing, and it feels like every week is becoming drier and drier.\n\nTo have fires with this intensity that move so quickly impacting the urban interface is a really hard thing to be confronted with and try to deal with.\n\nWe have been expecting a summer bushfire season like this for the past five or six years. It's been heading down this path for a while now.\n\nIt used to be that approximately every 10 years we would get one bad bushfire season.\n\nI think this will go down as the worst bushfire season in history.\n\nFor it to be as intense and prolonged as it is, and there doesn't seem to be any easing of conditions, is very difficult.\n\nWhen will firefighters get a break? When will the local community get a break? It just keeps on coming.\n\nThe communities we've worked with in the Blue Mountains are faced with fire from one direction one week and from the other direction the next. I really feel for them. I'm not sure that they're going to be able to totally relax during this holiday period.\n\nFor me, it's surreal to be sitting at home today, but two days ago I was in a life-or-death situation.\n\n## 'It is hard to deal with'\n\nI find it quite a hard situation to deal with sometimes. When you are in that moment and the adrenaline is going is one thing, but then when your shift finishes and you say OK it's time to go back to the family it can be hard to make the switch.\n\nIt doesn't feel like Christmas season this year. I haven't had that space to take all that in yet.\n\nI know that's the lot of an emergency services person, but your family feels it the most. You are away and they know you are in situations that are dangerous. The impact is quite large.\n\nParticularly over the time I've always been a bit cautious about how much information I share.\n\nYou don't want to disclose all the information because you don't want to scare them.\n\nBut over the past week we have had a number of conversations to say that the fire weather is going to be as bad as it gets, and I was quite concerned.\n\nBut at the same time, saying I'm safe.\n\nI knew my experience and training had prepared me well. So it was a matter of staying calm — even though the intensity went right up and we were a bit overwhelmed.\n\n## 'What keeps me going'\n\nWe all signed up to make a difference. Over the past couple of weeks when I've been working in these strike teams, we've been reflecting on the fact that yes, we want to help people and do our job, but when that's happening it also means community members are having one of the worst days of their lives.\n\nSo a quiet day for us is a good day.\n\nI am back in the field tomorrow. I don't know where I'll be deployed. I wonder when it is going to slow down.\n\nWe tend to say \"oh, this might be it\", but it seems to be coming back for another round, and another round after that.\n\nWe are out protecting these communities, and at the end of the day you just do what needs to be done.\n\n**Acting Inspector Brendan Hurley is a humanitarian team leader with Fire and Rescue NSW.**\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nBushfire smoke created smog in Sydney, causing air quality to reach 22 times worse than standard levels and causing respiratory problems for residents.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

The #MeToo movement went viral, spurring a national and global discussion on the issue.\n\nMany women have since come forward with their experiences of being sexually harassed by colleagues and bosses, costing influential men in the entertainment industry and the media — including journalists here at NPR — their jobs.\n\nAnd yet, there has been little data collected on the national prevalence of sexual harassment, says Michele Decker, director of the women's health and rights program at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. As a result, many people have asked, \"Where's the evidence?\" she says.\n\nNow an online survey launched in January by a nonprofit called Stop Street Harassment offers some of that missing evidence. It found that 81 percent of women and 43 percent of men had experienced some form of sexual harassment during their lifetime.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThose numbers are much larger than suggested by other recent polls. Those polls used a more limited sample or narrower definitions of harassment, says Anita Raj, director of the Center on Gender Equity and Health at the University of California, San Diego, who analyzed the results of the new survey.\n\nThe new survey, on the other hand, included a larger, more nationally representative sample of men and women ages 18 and above, says Raj.\n\nThe survey also involved a broader definition of sexual harassment that includes the \"continuum of experiences\" that women face, she says.\n\nLoading...\n\nThat includes verbal forms of sexual harassment, like being catcalled or whistled at or getting unwanted comments of a sexual nature. It also includes physical harassment, cyber harassment and sexual assaults.\n\nThe results, released in a report Wednesday, show that 77 percent of women had experienced verbal sexual harassment, and 51 percent had been sexually touched without their permission. About 41 percent said they had been sexually harassed online, and 27 percent said they had survived sexual assault.\n\nThe report also looked into locations where people experienced harassment. The majority of women — 66 percent — said they'd been sexually harassed in public spaces. \"The public forums are where you see the more chronic experiences of sexual harassment,\" says Raj. These include verbal harassment and physical harassment, like touching and groping.\n\nHowever, 38 percent of women said they experienced sexual harassment at the workplace. Thirty-five percent said they had experienced it at their residence. These experiences are more likely to be assaults and the \"most severe forms\" of harassment, says Raj.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"The findings show that this is a pervasive problem and permeates all sectors of our lives,\" says Holly Kearl, the main author of the report. \"Most people who said they had experienced sexual harassment experienced it in multiple locations.\"\n\n\"Sexual harassment until more recently has been viewed as part and parcel of what people experienced,\" says Decker, who wasn't involved in the survey. As a result, public health researchers don't monitor it. \"It's often been dismissed, because it's considered not as egregious as sexual assault or rape.\"\n\nRape and sexual violence are closely monitored by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey. As a result, public health agencies and health workers are more aware of their prevalence and have been able to take steps to help victims and offer programs aimed at preventing sexual violence.\n\nThe new report shows that sexual harassment, too, is worth monitoring, says Decker. \"We want to know that we're responding to things that are prevalent and common, and this is showing that sexual harassment is really prevalent.\"\n\nLoading...\n\nOne of the most striking findings from the report is that there is a very clear \"gender differential,\" she says. While men experience sexual harassment as well, the prevalence is higher for women, as is the intensity of those experiences. It also shows that men are more frequently the perpetrators, she adds.\n\nKearl says she was surprised at how few of the victims confronted their harasser. Instead, they changed their own lives to avoid harassers and reduce their risks of being harassed.\n\n\"They were changing their routes or routines; they were changing jobs, or moving,\" says Kearl.\n\nThe report also shows that most victims suffer from anxiety and depression as well, just like victims of sexual violence. \"It shows how challenging it is to confront someone. You'd rather change your life than confront the harasser,\" she says.\n\nRaj says her own teenage daughter's experience illustrates this. A couple of years ago, her daughter stopped walking to the public library by herself after she was harassed by a group of boys.\n\nLoading...\n\n\"She was walking from her high school in a very privileged, affluent area, an area that most people would define as very safe,\" Raj recalls. \"As she was walking alone around 3 o'clock in the afternoon, there was a group of boys that started calling out to her and saying things like 'nice hips.' And it just made her feel so uncomfortable [that] she didn't walk alone anymore.\"\n\nLike Raj's daughter, most women (and men) first experience sexual harassment pretty early in life — during preteen or teenage years. \"That's really disconcerting,\" says Raj.\n\nSimilarly disconcerting is the fact that most victims don't report their experiences, says Decker. \"People don't even mention it to friends, families.\" And so, sexual harassment is \"thriving on the silence of women,\" granting impunity to perpetrators, she says.\n\nSome of that has been turned upside down by the #MeToo movement, because it broke that silence and made it more culturally acceptable to talk about sexual harassment.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"The next wave of this is to really understand ... what are the barriers to people being able to access reporting process?\" says Decker. \"How can we support people who want to report this if they so choose?\"\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nWomen used social media to share sexual harassment experiences in October 2017, leading to the #MeToo movement going viral.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Most had been isolating for months as the coronavirus pandemic took hold.\n\nBut the death of yet another Black person at the hands of police seemed to shatter a dam in the American conscious.\n\nProtesters march from Lafayette Square to the US Capitol on May 29, 2020, to protest George Floyd's murder earlier that week. Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe 7-acre green space just north of the White House, known as Lafayette Square, had been a rallying place for change for more than a century, from women’s suffrage marches in 1917 to the fight for racial equality and gay rights half a century later.\n\nAnd so it was where protesters gathered to mourn the death of this 46-year-old father, George Floyd.\n\nFor Thomas, standing among the thousands of Americans of all races and faiths and demanding racial equality changed the way she thought about criminal justice and her role as a pastor serving a nearby church.\n\nIt was “this cathartic release, this need to demonstrate, to protest, to yell and to not hold the grief that this had triggered,” she said.\n\nAs the crowd chanted the names of Black lives lost to police violence – Tamir Rice, Sandra Bland, Eric Garner, Breonna Taylor – it began to feel to Thomas like a prayer.\n\n“That was a holy experience for me that is unmatched,” she said.\n\nThe daytime demonstrations were largely peaceful.\n\nBut as night fell on Washington – and other American cities – their tone changed.\n\nProtesters confront police on May 30, 2020.

Eric Baradat/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAfter nights of clashes, then-President Donald Trump, known for issuing directives and invectives through social media, fired off a series of posts shortly before 1 a.m. on Friday, May 29, 2020.\n\nHe condemned protests in Minneapolis that had become violent.\n\n“These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd,” he wrote before pivoting to a stark ultimatum:\n\n“Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts.”\n\nOutside the White House that evening, people began throwing rocks. Some tried to topple police barricades. The Secret Service rushed Trump and his family to the executive mansion’s bunker.\n\n“Nobody came close to breaching the fence,” Trump posted the following day. “If they had, they would have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen.”\n\nTrump’s allusions to police brutality – the very thing demonstrators were protesting – only seemed to rile them and underscore what was at stake.\n\nIt was also prescient.\n\nDemonstrations kept swelling through the weekend. Offices and other buildings around Lafayette Square were boarded up. But it didn’t stop the destruction.\n\nCrews board up buildings May 31, 2020, near the White House. Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images\n\nThe windows of Michelle Brown and Linda Neumann’s tea shop by the White House were smashed and the café set on fire, they told an influential city magazine. Even so, Brown quickly took to social media to underscore her support for those peacefully demanding change:\n\n“Before anyone puts a single word in our mouths,” she wrote: “Black lives matter.”\n\n“There’s insurance to cover things like this,” Neumann told the magazine. “We are both just so sad and heartbroken about what’s happening in the country and how things came to this.”\n\nThen, late Sunday night, an arsonist set fire to the basement of St. John’s Church, a landmark crowning the top of Lafayette Square and often referred to as the “presidents church” because so many have worshipped there.\n\nThe physical damage was minimal. But the flames ignited a series of events that soon would alter the landscape of the district itself.\n\nA man is injured during a May 30, 2020, protest near the White House.

Eric Thayer/Reuters\n\nThe following day, officials in Hennepin County, Minnesota, ruled Floyd’s death a homicide, codifying what many already sensed:\n\nFloyd’s life had been taken, and someone should be held accountable.\n\nProtesters again gathered outside the White House. Only this time, they were met by police.\n\nThe law enforcement presence was subtle at first. Officers observed from the park as demonstrators waved signs and chanted, “Hands up, don’t shoot!” and “No Justice! No Peace.”\n\nBut as the day wore on, the police presence grew. Journalists noticed.\n\n“These protests until now have been entirely calm,” CNN correspondent Alex Marquardt told Wolf Blitzer.\n\nUS Park Police stand watch June 1, 2020, as demonstrators protest at Lafayette Square. Olivier Douliery/AFP/Getty Images\n\n“In fact, even as this escalation is happening, as these police come up to confront the protesters, we have not seen the protesters respond in any sort of way, by throwing any sort of projectiles …\n\n“But Wolf, there’s also a fear of escalation.”\n\nThen, the mood shifted. Hundreds of National Guard troops staged near the park. A line of mounted police officers towered above the protesters and kept watch.\n\nThe White House announced Trump would make a statement in the Rose Garden.\n\nThe officers, Marquardt said, began to pull on gas masks.\n\nIn seconds, things went from peaceful to pandemonium.\n\nCNN\n\nA woman cries out after being exposed to tear gas on June 1, 2020, near the White House.

People fell. Others took a knee before the advancing line of police.\n\nMany retreated toward St. John’s Church.\n\nAs police descended, Thomas thought of the 1965 civil rights march to Montgomery, Alabama, that saw a young activist named John Lewis beaten bloody on a bridge in Selma.\n\n“All that was missing was a water hose and some dogs,” she recalled. “We’re marching to advance a cause – to say you can’t just kill people without due process – and you’re pushing us back with violence.”\n\nTear gas canisters cracked like thunder, and flash bangs echoed across White House lawns. Somehow, the Rose Garden maintained a relative tranquility, and from it, Trump spoke to the American people.\n\n“I will fight to protect you. I am your president of law and order and an ally of all peaceful protesters,” he said as helicopters whirred.\n\nTrump called on mayors and governors across the country to “dominate the streets” and “establish an overwhelming law enforcement presence until the violence has been quelled.”\n\nThen, he left the stage and made his way across the park.\n\nStanding in front of the boarded-up St. John’s Church, the president posed with a Bible, holding it in the air.\n\n“We have a great country,” he told reporters.\n\nPresident Donald Trump walks on June 1, 2020, between lines of riot police toward St. John's Church. Tom Brenner/Reuters\n\nCNN\n\nIt wasn’t long before pundits launched debates over Trump’s sacred prop, critics argued about the use of active-duty military against Americans exercising First Amendment rights and politicians lined up to assign blame.\n\nIn the office of the mayor of Washington, DC, the response was quieter as officials moved into action to make clear to the world – and the president living down the street – the city’s undisputed stance on the moral moment gripping the nation.\n\nFirst, they called Keyonna Jones.\n\nAn artist born and raised in Southeast DC, Jones – like many Americans – had been struggling to reconcile her own struggles in the pandemic with the injustice of Floyd’s death, she said.\n\nAll the same, she answered the phone. And in less than 24 hours, she was across town on 16th Street NW.\n\nWith an army of volunteers, friends, neighbors and municipal workers, Jones began to emblazon the two blocks leading directly to the White House with 50-foot letters that spelled out the moment’s words of empowerment so indelibly, they could be seen from space:\n\nA satellite photo shows the new plaza in June 2020. Maxar Technologies/Reuters\n\nOn June 5 – just 11 days after Floyd took his last breath – the district officially unveiled Black Lives Matter Plaza. The date happened to coincide with the birthday of Breonna Taylor, the Black American whose life had been cut tragically short that March in an encounter with police.\n\n“We know what’s going on in our country,” Mayor Muriel Bowser said. “We had the opportunity to send that message loud and clear on a very important street in our city … And that message is to the American people that Black Lives Matter, that Black humanity matters, and we as a city raise that up as part of our values.”\n\nKeyonna Jones\n\nCNN\n\nOther cities followed suit. In Montgomery, Alabama, the phrase marked the spot where enslaved people once were auctioned. In Tulsa, Oklahoma, the same kind of yellow letters were painted along Greenwood Avenue in homage to the lives stolen in the 1921 Race Massacre. New York commissioned a mural along 5th Avenue, just outside Trump Tower. More murals appeared in Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom.\n\nThey often were spurned. Many were vandalized. And some people, including Trump, saw them as divisive. He called Manhattan’s mural a “symbol of hate.”\n\nEven some within the Black Lives Matter movement declared the murals “performative,” an attempt by public officials to absolve themselves of the immensely hard work of rooting out systemic racism.\n\n“I think art is part of activism,” countered Jones, the artist. “It’s a universal language – people will see it, people will feel it and it’s starting a conversation that may not have happened.”\n\nNew York's Black Lives Matter street mural is vandalized on August 23, 2020, in a counter-protest outside Trump Tower.

The 80-year-old was battling pancreatic cancer, but he was determined to see the mural in person, a spokesperson said.\n\nForty days later, he died.\n\nThe district the following year spent millions making the mural a permanent installation, replacing traditional asphalt with colored pavers to spell out its eponymous phrase. The goal, the mayor said, was to transform “the mural into a monument.”\n\nIn its quieter moments, the public art acted as a beacon, calling on Americans – together – to mourn, celebrate, argue, strategize and reflect on the ongoing fight against racism in the United States and the nation’s commitment to equality.\n\nAnd, sure enough, it outlasted the pandemic. And the trial and conviction of Floyd’s murderer. And the entire Biden administration. And Trump’s return this year to the White House.\n\nThousands gather on November 7, 2020, at Black Lives Matter Plaza in Washington to celebrate Joe Biden's electoral victory.

That doesn’t make sense.”\n\nAs Thomas watched the construction crews and excavators, she felt gutted and angry. In the nearly five years since Floyd’s death, she’d opted against preaching from the pulpit and instead ministered directly to activists and advocates leading protest movements across the country.\n\nWitnessing the ordered destruction, she wondered: “Are you thinking if you dig this up … you can just erase what we’ve done here?”\n\nCNN\n\nThen, in full view of the workers, Thomas picked up a chunk of the mural and walked away.\n\nIt was “an act of defiance, an act of resistance,” she said. “You can’t erase memory. You can’t erase conviction.”\n\nJones felt much the same way. Five years after her artwork drew global attention, the United States has seemingly returned to its status quo, she said, with conversations about – and, more importantly, actions toward – racial equality fading again into the background.\n\nStill, the artist said, her father recently reminded her of a speech by the Rev. Jesse Jackson, the civil rights leader who rushed to but could not save a dying Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nIn the speech, Jackson invoked the biblical boy David who fells the giant Goliath and encouraged Americans to continue to fight systems of injustice and not to be brought down by the “margin of despair.”\n\n“We have to recognize that we’re Davids,” Jones said. “There are rocks laying around that we can use to defeat the system.”\n\nWe just have to pick them up.\n\nTears roll down the face of Starlette Thomas on March 10 as she holds a chunk of pavement from the Black Lives Matter Plaza mural.

I can’t find the words to describe my frustration,” said Kim Hyo-lim, 23, after the motion failed. “I am devastated, but I feel honored to be a part of this historic moment for my country.”\n\nAs the rally kicked off in the afternoon, the atmosphere was festive. Many parents brought along their young children.\n\nLee Soo-young, 38, pushed her 2-year-old son in a stroller. “I don’t want him to live in a country that could be under martial law again,” she said.\n\nOver the next few hours, the crowds swelled, even as night fell and the temperature dropped. Seoul’s subway operator closed three nearby stations, yet people continued to flow in, filling several blocks and intersections. Many people held candles or colorful light sticks. They carried blankets to bundle up against the temperatures, which have hovered near freezing all week. Chants and music could be heard from blocks away.\n\nOrganizers used Facebook to arrange cross-country transportation: shuttle buses from cities hours away from Seoul and even plane rides from Jeju, an island off the southern coast. On X, people shared names that protesters could give at nearby cafes to get free drinks.\n\nWhile most of the attention was on the crowds outside the National Assembly, in another part of Seoul, a much smaller group of Mr. Yoon’s supporters gathered in one of the city’s main plazas. Mr. Yoon’s low approval rating plunged further this week. But thousands of his supporters sang anthems and waved South Korean and U.S. flags on Saturday.\n\nDemonstrators there did not want to talk about the short-lived martial law. Instead, person after person criticized the leader of the main opposition party, Lee Jae-myung, calling him a communist, and said Mr. Yoon was protecting the country from communism and preserving its relationship with the United States.\n\nWhile the crowd supporting Mr. Yoon was predominantly older, outside the National Assembly, many were protesting for the first time.\n\nAmong them was An Ye-young, 19, who said her parents disagreed with her politically. “For many of us who don’t usually pay attention to politics, and have just turned old enough to vote, there’s been a wake-up call to become more aware,” she said.\n\nThe night martial law was imposed, Ms. An couldn’t sleep. She rewatched “A Taxi Driver,” the South Korean film about the uprising against martial law in Gwangju in May 1980. “When I saw the scenes where citizens raised their voices,” she said, “I thought I should go and protest.”\n\nChang W. Lee and Qasim Nauman contributed reporting from Seoul.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nPresident Yoon Suk Yeol was immediately suspended from exercising his powers.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA. The impeachment motion against President Yoon failed.\nB. Baek Jae Gil performed his protest anthem for thousands outside the National Assembly in Seoul.\nC.

I do not want to hear his name again, and I want it to disappear from the news. If that happens, hopefully this man who thrived on holding power over women will start feeling powerless. Worthless. Alone.\n\nWho I do care about is you, the ones who tweeted #MeToo. The women who have experienced the pain of feeling powerless, worthless and alone. Because you are the ones who deserve to be heard and have a voice louder than those who wish to silence it.\n\nWhat is #MeToo? Two small words — one big meaning — and a force across social media.\n\nIf you’ve been on Twitter or Facebook at all in the past few days and follow any of the millions of women who have used this hashtag, you know what I’m referring to. With a simple tweet on Sunday, Alyssa Milano started a firestorm when she asked that anyone who had been sexually harassed to reply with “me too.”\n\nWho’s the boss? Alyssa is.\n\nDifficult conversation about sexual harassment grows larger\n\nAlthough originally in response to Weinstein and the slew of similar sexual harassment reports now widespread across the news, #MeToo has quickly grown into a larger conversation, and it’s a difficult one. From those worried that the conversation could lead to witch hunts to women calling for fewer hashtags and more change, everyone seems to have joined the discussion.\n\nFor me, that alone is very worthwhile. Not that I feel warm and fuzzy seeing women come out en masse to share their horror stories — well, other than Mayim Bialik — I do have a strange sense of pride watching the story unfold, as women are being so open, bold and truthful.\n\nMaybe the truth can set us free?\n\nThat sounds so simplistic. Don’t get me wrong, I absolutely do not believe that the answer to a cultural change is that easy, but I do feel that it’s a start. There’s power in words, just as there is power in secrecy. If our culture starts talking about things that have, for so long, been closed-door conversations, is it possible that those conversations could reduce the frequency and acceptance of harassment? If women no longer feel that they have to be ashamed and bad conduct is not swept under the rug for fear of repercussions, would more voices be heard? And, if the women that come forward are given an active voice to describe the offense AND offender, rather than minimizing the situation as a women’s issue (see video above; thank you, Jackson Katz!), would they be less likely to hesitate?\n\nAt the same time that I ask these questions to you, I also ask them of myself. Would I be less afraid if society accepted open dialogue about sexual harassment and rape without implication of fault on the victim? Obviously, I would. Until that day when I can share my own stories of harassment — and even assault — I’ll just say this: #MeToo.\n\nLisha Dunlap Lisha Dunlap is a NonDoc commentator and freelance writer with a mass media degree from Washburn University.

In a shock twist, a rebellion led by Wagner Group chief Yevgeny Prigozhin appeared on Saturday to develop into a short-lived military coup. After seizing official buildings in the southern city of Rostov-on-Don — which borders Ukraine and is an important logistical hub for the Kremlin’s war effort — and launching a column of armored vehicles towards Moscow, Prigozhin announced Saturday evening that he was halting the march towards the capital and that his soldiers would retreat to their camps “to avoid bloodshed.”\n\nAt the end of a frenetic day, the Kremlin announced that it planned to drop all charges against Prigozhin and the soldiers who took part in the uprising. And that the Wagner leader, whose whereabouts Putin’s spokesman said were unknown, would be allowed to take refuge in Belarus.\n\nPrigozhin’s rebellion against the Defense Ministry, which turned into the first coup attempt Russia has seen in three decades, has weakened Russian President Vladimir Putin and his regime as it faces the Ukrainian counteroffensive.\n\n“Now the moment has come when blood can be shed,” said Prigozhin in an audio broadcast on one of his Telegram channels. “Therefore, realizing all the responsibility for the fact that Russian blood will be shed from one side, we will turn our convoys around and go in the opposite direction to our field camps.”\n\nAccording to Western intelligence sources, behind-the-scenes negotiations with the mercenary chief to halt the march took place all day long. Since Saturday morning, Prigozhin escalated his defiance and rebellion by seizing the center of the border town of Rostov-on-Don and then ignored Putin’s warnings to stand down.\n\nBelarusian President Aleksandr Lukashenko claimed credit for negotiating the deal, saying in a statement that an “absolutely profitable and acceptable” agreement had been reached and that he had been given unspecified “security guarantees” for the mercenaries. Prigozhin’s revolt was extremely risky: the businessman does not have the support of the elites.\n\nDuring Friday night and Saturday day, Prigozhin crossed his own personal Rubicon. Backed into a corner by his escalating dispute with Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, he launched a rebellion that, even if it has fizzled out now, could not be without consequences. President Putin — who until Saturday had permitted Prigozhin’s quarrels with his defense minister — charged against the mercenaries chief, accusing Prigozhin of treason and “stabbing the Russian people in the back.” He promised to crush the coup, promising to “decisive action” to stabilize the situation.\n\nPrigozhin and his mercenaries met little opposition in their march towards Moscow. There were several attacks from the air with regular army helicopters, gunfire from a fighter plane and two fuel tanks were blown up to hinder their advance. The uprising is the most serious threat the Kremlin has faced since the Chechen war two decades ago. The situation may fuel internal conflicts in Russia, triggered by the defeats of the Kremlin forces in Ukraine and the lack of means, material and preparation of Russia’s troops. Prigozhin has denounced all these problems in a constant litany that has helped him gain greater visibility.\n\nThe Wagner crisis and its resolution are of grave geopolitical importance, given Russia possesses one of the world’s largest arsenals of nuclear weapons. Globally, it was met with a muted global reaction. The G-7 countries held an emergency call and, together with the EU and NATO allies, said they were closely monitoring the situation. But they did not venture to say more, fearing the Kremlin could use their words in their rhetoric against the West. Instead, they described the situation as an “internal problem” for Russia. Meanwhile, Russia’s Foreign Ministry warned Western countries against trying to “exploit” the Wagner Group rebellion “to achieve their Russophobic goals.”\n\nRussian authorities on Saturday declared an “anti-terrorist operations regime” in Moscow, which allowed them to close roads, monitor conversations and restrict movement. Before Prigozhin announced an end to the Wagner Group’s so-called “march for justice,” Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin declared that next Monday would be a non-working day — except for security forces and city services — and urged citizens to avoid the streets.\n\nIn a fiery speech on Saturday, Putin lashed out at what he considered the mercenary leader’s betrayal — until now, Prigozhin had been loyal to the Russian president and left him out of his verbal attacks against Shoigu, Moscow elites and “corrupt bureaucrats.” Without mentioning Prigozhin by name, Putin compared Saturday’s uprising to the 1917 revolution that destroyed the Russian Empire, “when the country was fighting World War I, but its victory was stolen.”\n\n“We will not let this happen again. We will protect our people and state from any threats, including internal betrayal. What we’re facing is exactly a betrayal,” said Putin in a five-minute speech broadcast Saturday morning on state TV. “Big ambitions and personal interests led to treason. Betrayal of one’s own country and people and of the cause that fighters of Wagner were dying for alongside our soldiers.”\n\n“Any internal mutiny is a deadly threat to our state, to us as a nation. It’s a blow against Russia, against our people. And our actions to defend the fatherland from such a threat will be brutal,” said Putin, who added that security forces had been ordered to regain control of the city of Rostov-on-Don. Information from flight tracking and registration websites showed that at least two aircraft of the fleet that carries the Kremlin leadership flew from Moscow to St. Petersburg on Saturday afternoon. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov maintained that Putin was still in the capital.\n\nIn response to Putin’s speech, Prigozhin released an audio message on his Telegram channels, in which he argued that the Russian president was “sorely mistaken” and defended Wagner mercenaries as the true patriots of Russia. “No one is going to give themselves up at the request of the president, the [Russian secret service] FSB or anyone else. We don’t want this country to go on living in corruption, deception and bureaucracy,” said Prigozhin, hours before standing down, in a heated message against military elites, whom he accuses of sending Russian troops unprepared into the “meat grinder” of Ukraine.\n\nThe decision to retreat was opposed by some members of the Wagner Group, who have accused Prigozhin of being a politician “like the rest” and of “incriminating” the mercenaries with his rebellion. Messages from mercenaries claiming they were breaking their contract with Wagner went viral on some Telegram channels, although local media footage from Rostov-on-Don, which acted as a base for the mercenaries on Saturday, showed several of them relaxing and talking to citizens.\n\nWindow of opportunity for Ukrainian counteroffensive\n\nWagner’s rebellion may have major consequences for the war in Ukraine due to its implication for frontline troops and the fact that it comes at a decisive moment for the Ukrainian counteroffensive. Ukrainian Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Maliar said Saturday that the rebellion, which exposes the cracks already pervading Russian society, is a “window of opportunity” for her forces. The decision to launch the full-scale invasion of Ukraine has triggered “the inevitable degradation of the Russian state,” she said.\n\nKyiv, which estimates that Moscow keeps some 400,000 Russian military personnel deployed in Ukraine, welcomed the instability in the invading country. “Everything is just beginning in Russia,” Mykhailo Podolyak, a top adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said Saturday, referring to the divisions shaking the neighboring country. According to Podolyak, it was impossible for both sides to emerge unscathed from the revolt: either the Kremlin or Prigozhin had to be defeated.\n\n“The split between the elites is now too obvious,” said Podolyak. “Someone must lose.” In a message on Twitter, the adviser also pointed out that the “counter-terrorist operation” had already resulted in the seizure of Rostov, a number of federal highways and the military headquarters of the Southern District.\n\nBritish intelligence reports say that Russia is facing its biggest domestic challenge in years, in which the degree of the military’s loyalty to the Kremlin will be key. The well-known enmity between Prigozhin and the Kremlin has escalated to “military confrontation” and the passivity with which some Russian military personnel have accepted the mercenary uprising suggests that they accept it, according to the report.\n\nThe head of the Wagner mercenary organization, Yevgeny Prigozhin, has declared his rebellion against the Russian military leadership on Saturday after accusing the Armed Forces of bombing one of his camps.

After months of insults and veiled accusations that he had been outgunned in the Battle of Bakhmut, Prigozhin recorded a video on Thursday in which he accused the minister of lying about Russia’s “successful” defense on the Zaporizhzhia front. “A huge amount of territory is lost. Soldiers have been killed, three, four times more than what it says in documents shown to the top,” said the Wagner Group chief.\n\nBefore Prigozhin announced a halt to the march, the Head of the Chechen Republic Ramzan Kadyrov broke his silence and placed his Praetorian Guard at the Kremlin’s disposal. “The fighters of the Ministry of Defense and the Russian Guard in the Chechen Republic have already left for the zones of tension,” he said on Telegram. “We will do everything to preserve the unity of Russia and protect its statehood! The rebellion must be crushed, and if this requires harsh measures, then we are ready!”\n\nSign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage from EL PAÍS USA Edition\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nWagner troops withdrew from Rostov, the Lipetsk region, and Moscow.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Referred to as the GENIUS Act, the bipartisan bill must be passed by the House before going to the president for his signature.\n\nOnly U.S.-regulated banks and other authorized firms would be permitted to issue stablecoins under the law.\n\nStablecoins would have to be backed 1:1 by U.S. dollars or other highly liquid assets, and issuers would be prohibited from paying interest on stablecoin holdings.\n\nForeign issuers would be allowed to sell their stablecoins in the U.S. if the issuer complies with certain conditions, including responding to seizure orders.\n\n\n\nLegislation regulating the issuance and distribution of stablecoins in the U.S. took a major step forward when the U.S. Senate passed the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act, better known as the GENIUS Act (the Act). The Act, which cleared the Senate in a 68-30 vote on June 17, 2025, awaits House passage and could be signed into law by President Donald Trump later this summer.\n\nWe outline below some key points in the Senate bill.\n\nStablecoins, which are typically digital assets pegged directly to a fiat currency, are one of the most common instruments used for conversions between cryptoassets. Many proponents also envision a broader role for stablecoins in the payments system, including as a means to effectuate traditional payments and cross-border transactions.\n\nPermitted issuers. The Act creates the concept of a “permitted payment stablecoin issuer,” which must be one of the following:\n\nA subsidiary of an insured depository institution that has been approved to issue stablecoins.\n\nA federal qualified payment stablecoin issuer that is regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.\n\nA state qualified payment stablecoin issuer that has a $10 billion or less market capitalization and is operating under federal standards or regulated by a state banking agency.\n\nBacking. Stablecoins must be fully backed on a 1:1 basis with U.S. dollars or other approved high-quality liquid assets such as Treasury bills. These reserves would need to be segregated from operational funds and only used to back the stablecoins. Issuers must also certify the sufficiency of their reserves on a monthly basis.\n\nForeign issuers. The rights of foreign stablecoin issuers has been a hotly debated topic. Under the Senate bill, foreign-issued stablecoins may be offered or sold in the U.S. if the foreign issuer has the technical capability to comply with lawful government orders (such as seizures) and is in compliance with any reciprocal arrangement between the U.S. and the issuer’s foreign jurisdiction. Whether the “and” should be an “or” is one of the key issues being debated.\n\nCompliance obligations. Issuers will be treated as “financial institutions” under the Bank Secrecy Act and subject to compliance with requirements relating to economic sanctions, anti-money laundering, and customer identification and due diligence.\n\nNonfinancial institution issuers. Another hotly debated issue is whether public companies not predominantly engaged in one or more financial activities can be permitted to issue stablecoins. Although not prohibited in initial drafts of the bill, it seems likely such a prohibition will make it into the final draft, subject to exceptions.\n\nPaying interest. The Act prohibits issuers from paying stablecoin holders any form of interest or yield solely in connection with the holding, use or retention of the issuer’s stablecoin.\n\nNaming the assets. Issuers cannot use any combination of terms relating to the U.S. government when naming their payment stablecoins, nor can they use anything that would give the impression that these are legal tender, or issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government.\n\nGiven the considerable debate and advocacy regarding several key provisions of the GENIUS Act, issuers and potential issuers of stablecoins, as well as service providers that might offer these digital assets, should closely monitor how the legislation advances this summer.\n\n(See also “The Proliferation of Cryptoasset Treasury Strategies in Public Markets” and “How Asset Managers Are Capitalizing on Hong Kong's Regulations Permitting Virtual Asset Funds.”)\n\nThis memorandum is provided by Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP and its affiliates for educational and informational purposes only and is not intended and should not be construed as legal advice. This memorandum is considered advertising under applicable state laws.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nThe U.S. Congress defined legal requirements for stablecoins, including HQLA, one-for-one backing, and audits.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA. In January 2025, the US issued an executive order promoting stablecoins and prohibiting central bank digital currencies.\nB. In March 2023, major stablecoins like USDC experienced brief de-pegging events due to banking sector stress.\nC. On June 17, 2025, the U.S. Senate passed the GENIUS Act.\nD. On May 20, 2025, the Senate voted 66-32 to advance a modified version of the GENIUS Act.\n\n/You MUST answer based strictly on the instructions:\n### INSTRUCTIONS:\nBased solely on the provided CONTEXT, evaluate each option for the TARGET EVENT.

How will he eventually go? Who is likely to succeed him? Surely a dictator so surrounded by sycophantic generals, spies and secret policemen could ward off any serious threat? There was no one obvious to lead a move to throw him out. Anyway, his successor might be even worse. The broad conclusion was that he could be with us for a long time.\n\nThese were always fragile arguments. No dictator foresees the coup that overthrows him. No one can follow all the intrigues from outside. All politicians eventually lose their political instincts. It took Mrs Thatcher thirteen years. Putin has been there nearly twice as long- and his position has become increasingly brittle.\n\nWhen he moved centre stage as president in 2000, Putin promised the Russians prosperity, stability and the restoration of their self-respect after the chaotic poverty and humiliation of the Yeltsin years. His innate political cunning was accompanied by good fortune. High oil prices gave him the money to meet most of his popular promises. People turned a blind eye to his brutal rule and the corruption of his associates.\n\nBut he became obsessed with Ukraine. Like many of his countrymen, he resented the way it had detached itself from Russia after what they saw as centuries of intimate partnership, and he was determined to do something about it. He began by interfering directly with Ukrainian domestic politics in order to increase his own influence and reduce that of the West. Next, by means of a rather well-executed coup de main, he annexed Crimea to Russia, claiming that Ukraine had acquired it illegally as the result of an irresponsible political gesture by the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev six decades earlier. Then, scarcely bothering to hide what he was doing, he gave military and political support to the rebels fighting to bring Eastern Ukraine into Russia.\n\nFinally, he launched a full-scale invasion, on the pretext that Ukrainian fascists had already begun a war with the help of the West, designed to destroy the thousand-year-old Russian state. He evidently thought that could quickly reduce Ukraine to a vassal or take it over entirely. The Ukrainians surprised him, the West, and perhaps even themselves by the courageous ingenuity of their resistance.\n\nPutin tried to compensate for military failure by a burst of patriotic hysteria. He then made a further massive misjudgement. No dictator in his right mind allows a subordinate to build an independent military force. But, as he ran short of Russian regular and conscript soldiers, he farmed out part of the battle to a crony from the lower depths of St Petersburg, Yevgeny Prigozhin, who contributed his own army of convicts sprung from the prisons of Russia. They were fairly effective and grotesquely brutal, but they were unable to break the Ukrainians.\n\nPrigozhin was scornful of the incompetent way the Russian military had managed the initial stages of the war. He was deeply resentful of their attempts to gain control over him. He claimed that they were deliberately starving his men of weapons and ammunition. The war, he went on to trumpet, was nothing to do with Ukrainian Fascists: it was simply a get-rich-quick scheme devised by greedy and ambitious generals for their own benefit. This was already a serious swipe at Putin. But on 23 June Prigozhin tipped over into armed rebellion. He and his men put tanks on the streets of Rostov-on-Don, the logistics and communications hub for the Russian army in Ukraine, and took over the military headquarters there. He demanded that the military leadership come to him: otherwise he would go to Moscow to get them himself. He claimed it was not a coup, but a demand for justice.\n\nAt first Putin appears to have tried force. There are stories that Prigozhin’s men were bombarded by missiles and attacked by helicopters. But he failed to clip Prigozhin’s wings. He then accused Prigozhin on television of betraying his country and his people in their time of need, and called for his arrest. He drew a remarkably inept parallel with the events of 1917 – it’s not clear whether he was referring to the mutinies that brought down the Tsar in February оr the march on the capital by a rebellious general in August. Either way, people’s blood must have run cold as they remembered the horrors which followed that disastrous year.\n\nPutin’s ministers and generals, his spies and his policemen, rallied round him, at least in public. So did thugs, such as Ramzan Kadyrov, who has ruled Chechnya since Putin pounded it into submission. The authorities dug up the roads to Moscow as Prigozhin and his soldiers approached. Abandoning his threat to prosecute the traitor, Putin got his crony, the Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko, to negotiate a deal. Saying he wanted to avoid bloodshed, Prigozhin marched his men back down the hill. It’s not yet clear where they will end up, or who will pay for them when they get there. But as they left Rostov they were cheered on the streets.\n\nPrigozhin bottled out and made a fool of himself. But Putin’s weakness has been shown up and his authority diminished. Much of the detail is still murky. The right-wing extremists who used to support Prigozhin are still around. We don’t know what the soldiers in the field or the wretched Russian people really think or how they will finally jump. We still have no idea how or when Putin will go, or who will succeed him. But the end of the Putin era is surely heaving into sight.\n\nMeanwhile, Moscow has a war to fight.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nPrigozhin negotiated his exit and called off his march on Moscow on Saturday afternoon.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA. Putin delivered a televised address accusing Prigozhin of treason.\nB. Russian military helicopters opened fire on the Wagner convoy.\nC.

Those poor people, all at similar ages to my grandchildren, they died anyway,” said Jung Si-hoon, a retiree and a church elder, who placed an old wooden cross at the makeshift altar.\n\n“What more should we say? We should pray for them and wish they rest in peace.”\n\nShops and cafés nearby were closed, and police cordoned off the site of the tragedy as they continued their investigations.\n\nSchools, kindergartens and companies around the country scrapped planned Halloween events. K-pop concerts and government briefings were also cancelled.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“The government will undertake a thorough investigation into what caused this accident and do its best to make necessary institutional changes so that such an accident is not repeated,” Prime Minister Han said as government officials met on the disaster.\n\n“Identification has been completed for all of the 154 deceased except one, and I believe it is time for follow-up measures such as funeral procedures to be carried out in earnest,” Han said. “We will do our best to provide necessary support by reflecting the opinions of the bereaved families as much as possible.”\n\nPresident Yoon Suk-yeol, who has declared a period of national mourning and designated Itaewon a disaster zone, visited a memorial altar outside the Seoul city hall with his wife on Monday to pay his respects to those who died. Former United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon was also among those expressing their condolences.\n\nThe crush of partygoers came as Itaewon, a symbol of freewheeling nightlife in the South Korean capital for decades, was beginning to recover from prolonged pandemic restrictions with new restaurants and shops opening.\n\nThe disaster is the worst in South Korea since the Sewol ferry sank in 2014, killing 304 people, most of them high school students.\n\nThe sinking of the Sewol and criticism of the official response sent shockwaves across South Korea, prompting widespread soul-searching over safety measures that are likely to be renewed in the wake of Saturday’s crush.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nLocal governments established public mourning sites.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Britons have criticized the EU for its handling of a range of issues, resent the loss of power to the Brussels-based institution and are divided among themselves about the institution they first joined in 1973.\n\nMore broadly, a Pew Research Center survey conducted this spring found that publics in a number of other EU countries share the British desire for a less, not more, centralized Europe, and that the debate about the future of the EU will not subside just because the UK has now voted.\n\nThe EU has never been as popular in the UK as it has been among other EU members. Just 44% of the public in the UK has a favorable view of the EU, compared with a median of 50% who hold a favorable opinion in five other EU nations surveyed by Pew Research Center. Support for the EU is down in the UK from a high of 52% in 2014. British views of the EU have consistently been lower than those on the continent for nearly a decade.\n\nThe British have long thought that the EU was inefficient and intrusive and has mishandled the challenges facing Europe. In a 2014 Pew Research Center survey, 64% of the British thought the EU was inefficient and does not understand the needs of its citizens. Six-in-ten said it was intrusive. In this year’s survey, 70% in the UK disapprove of the EU’s handling of the refugee issue and 55% said the same about the EU’s dealing with economic issues.\n\nThe vote to leave reflects the desire of nearly two-thirds of the UK public to bring back some EU powers from Brussels to London. Fully 65% of the British said before the referendum that they wanted some EU powers to be returned to their national government. This included 73% of those ages 50 and older, 70% of men, 68% of those with a secondary education or less, 93% of UK Independence Party supporters, 77% of Conservative Party adherents and 49% of Labour Party backers.\n\nThe Brexit vote exposes a rift in public opinion between the Scottish and people in the rest of the United Kingdom. The Scottish voted to stay in the EU by an overwhelming margin of 62% to 38%, putting a new Scottish independence referendum on the table. Pew Research Center data show that the Scottish are more likely than those in England, Northern Ireland and Wales to have a favorable opinion of the EU (53% versus 43% respectively).\n\nScotland also disagrees with the rest of the UK on two issues central to the Brexit debate: the economy and immigration. The Scottish feel more threatened by the prospect of global economic instability than their counterparts in the rest of the UK. Roughly six-in-ten say it is a major threat to their country, while only 48% say the same in England, Northern Ireland and Wales. Meanwhile, the rest of the UK feels more threatened by the large number of refugees leaving countries such as Iraq and Syria (54% major threat). Just 41% of Scottish people agree.\n\nThe rest of Europe sees Brexit as pivotal for the well-being of the EU. Before the referendum, a median of 70% said that they thought it would be a bad thing for the EU if the UK were to leave. This included 89% of the Swedes, 75% of the Dutch and 74% of the Germans.\n\nThe debate in other EU member states about the future of the institution may just be getting started. A majority of the Greeks (68%) and pluralities of the Dutch (44%), Germans (43%), Italians (39%) and French (39%) all want some EU power returned to their national governments. Both the Dutch and the French have a history of holding referendums on major and not-so-major issues, and Euroskeptic parties in both countries have already voiced support for a public vote on their relationship with the EU.\n\nNOTE (April 2017): After publication, the weight for the Netherlands data was revised to correct percentages for two regions. The impact of this revision on the Netherlands data included in this blog post is very minor and does not materially change the analysis. For a summary of changes, see here.

Google’s parent company lost $100bn and Microsoft $7bn.\n\nNvidia’s fall was the biggest in US stock market history.\n\nThe DeepSeek AI assistant also topped the Apple app store in the US and UK over the weekend, above OpenAI’s ChatGPT.\n\nUS President Donald Trump said DeepSeek should be a “wake-up call for our industries that we need to be laser-focused on competing to win”.\n\nHe said he had been “reading about China” and its companies, in particular one that had come up with a “faster method of AI and [a] much less expensive method”.\n\n“That’s good because you don’t have to spend as much money. I view that as a positive, as an asset,” Trump said.\n\nOpenAI chief executive Sam Altman praised DeepSeek’s launch, saying that it was “invigorating to have a new competitor”.\n\nIn a social media post, Altman called it “an impressive model, particularly around what they’re able to deliver for the price”.\n\nJapanese tech firms linked to the AI sector tanked for a second straight day on Tuesday as investors tracked the rout on Wall Street. Advantest plunged more than 9%, while tech investor SoftBank, a key investor in Trump’s Stargate AI project, tumbled more than 5%, having lost 8% the day before.\n\nMost other Asian markets rose in limited trade ahead of the lunar new year break.\n\nDeepSeek was hit with a cyber-attack on Monday, forcing it to temporarily limit registrations. On its status page, DeepSeek said it started to investigate the issue late Monday night Beijing time. After about two hours of monitoring, the company said it was the victim of a “large-scale malicious attack”. While DeekSeek limited registrations, existing users were still able to log on as usual.\n\nDeepSeek claims to have used fewer chips than its rivals to develop its models, making them cheaper to produce and raising questions over a multibillion-dollar AI spending spree by US companies that has boosted markets in recent years.\n\nThe company developed bespoke algorithms to build its models using reduced-capability H800 chips produced by Nvidia, according to a research paper published in December.\n\nNvidia’s most advanced chips, H100s, have been banned from export to China since September 2022 by US sanctions. Nvidia then developed the less powerful H800 chips for the Chinese market, although they were also banned from export to China last October.\n\nDeepSeek’s success at building an advanced AI model without access to the most cutting-edge US technology has raised concerns about the efficacy of Washington’s attempts to stymie China’s hi-tech sector.\n\nMarc Andreessen, a leading US venture capitalist, compared the launch of DeepSeek’s R1 model last Monday to a pivotal moment in the US-USSR space race, posting on X that it was AI’s “Sputnik moment” – referring to when the Soviet Union astounded its cold war rival by launching a satellite into orbit.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Liang reportedly started buying Nvidia chips in 2021 to develop AI models as a hobby, bankrolled by his hedge fund. In 2023, he founded DeepSeek, which is based in the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou.\n\nThe company is purely focused on research rather than commercial products – the DeepSeek assistant and underlying code can be downloaded for free, while DeepSeek’s models are also cheaper to operate than OpenAI’s o1.\n\nIn an interview with Chinese media, Liang said “AI should be affordable and accessible to everyone”. Liang also said that the gap between US and Chinese AI was only one to two years.\n\nThe DeepSeek development raises doubts over the necessity for hefty investment in AI infrastructure such as chips and the market-leading role of US tech companies in AI, which in turn threatens to put American tech sector valuations under pressure.\n\nDeepSeek claims R1 cost $5.6m to develop, compared with much higher estimates for western-developed models, although experts have cautioned that may be an underestimate. Last year Dario Amodei, the co-founder of leading AI firm Anthropic, put the current cost of training advanced models at between $100m and $1bn.\n\nAnalysts at US investment bank Goldman Sachs raised the alarm over AI spending last year by publishing a note in June with the title “Gen AI: too much spend, too little benefit?”\n\nIt asked if a $1tn investment in AI over the next few years will “ever pay off”, voicing concerns about a return on spending that may have been crystalised by DeepSeek.\n\nThe pan-European Stoxx 600 fell on Monday, and major European technology stocks were down. The Dutch chipmaker ASML slid by 7%, while Germany’s Siemens Energy, which provides hardware for AI infrastructure, was down nearly 20%, and France’s digital automation company Schneider Electric fell by 9.5%.\n\nRichard Hunter, the head of markets at the platform Interactive Investor, said: “It will almost certainly put the cat among the pigeons as investors scramble to assess the potential damage it could have on a burgeoning industry, which has powered much of the gain seen in the main indices over the last couple of years.\n\n“The larger question has suddenly become whether the hundreds of billions of dollar investment in AI needs re-evaluation.”\n\nDr Andrew Duncan, the director of science & innovation at the UK’s Alan Turing Institute, said the DeepSeek development was “really exciting” because it “democratised access” to advanced AI models by being an open source developer, meaning it makes its models freely available – a path also followed by Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta with its Llama model.\n\n“Academia and the private sector will be able to play around and explore with it and use it as a launching,” he said.\n\nDuncan added: “It demonstrates that you can do amazing things with relatively small models and resources. It shows that you can innovate without having the massive resources, say, of OpenAI.”\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nDonald Trump hailed a $500 billion plan by OpenAI, SoftBank, and Oracle.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

But speaking at the company's Connect virtual reality conference, Zuckerberg said it's time to overhaul the corporation's identity to reflect its broader ambitions.\n\n\"It is time for us to adopt a new company brand to encompass everything that we do,\" he said. \"From now on, we're going to be metaverse first, not Facebook first.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nSeventeen years after Zuckerberg founded Facebook in his Harvard University dorm room, the company's brand has been badly dented by a succession of crises, from Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election to the Cambridge Analytica data privacy scandal, which became public in 2018, to last month's damaging revelations from former Facebook employee turned whistleblower Frances Haugen.\n\nBut even as the company has been pummeled by a wave of critical news coverage about its platforms' harms, based on Haugen's trove of internal documents, Zuckerberg has unapologetically kept his focus on the metaverse, describing it on Thursday as the company's new \"North Star.\"\n\nHe says the metaverse is the next big computing platform to which people's attention — and dollars — will shift in the coming years. And he wants the newly christened Meta to play a prime role in creating it and turning it into big business.\n\n\"Building our social media apps will always be an important focus for us. But right now, our brand is so tightly linked to one product that it can't possibly represent everything that we're doing today, let alone in the future,\" Zuckerberg said.\n\nSo just what is the metaverse anyway?\n\nZuckerberg announced the new name, Meta, in a glitzy video presentation that served as an explainer about the metaverse, a futuristic and vaguely defined concept that has become a Silicon Valley buzzword in recent years.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe term \"metaverse\" was coined by science fiction writer Neal Stephenson in his 1992 novel, Snow Crash. Enthusiasts use it to refer to immersive virtual spaces where people can play games, attend concerts, meet with colleagues and buy all kinds of digital goods and services.\n\nFacebook demonstrated many of those experiences in Thursday's slickly produced video, showing Zuckerberg riding a virtual reality electric hydrofoil (in a nod to his real-life hobby), fencing with a hologram and walking through a 3D rendering of his \"home space.\"\n\nThis week, Facebook told investors its spending on virtual reality and other next-generation products and services will take a $10 billion bite out of its overall operating profit this year. It also announced plans to hire 10,000 workers in Europe over the next five years to build the metaverse.\n\nOn Thursday, Zuckerberg said he expects to invest \"many billions of dollars for years to come,\" painting a vision of the future where a billion people will use the metaverse and it will generate hundreds of billions of dollars in digital commerce — while acknowledging it remains \"a long way off.\"\n\n\"We are fully committed to this,\" Zuckerberg said. \"It is the next chapter of our work and, we believe, for the internet overall.\"\n\nIn a nod to Facebook's long run of crises, Zuckerberg devoted part of the presentation to emphasizing that the company will center privacy and safety as it builds its new virtual services and hardware.\n\n\"Privacy standards will be built into the metaverse from Day 1,\" he said. \"One of the lessons I've internalized from the last five years is we need to emphasize these principles from the start.\"\n\nThe change could be key to the company's existence\n\nStaying on top of the next big thing in tech is about more than just Zuckerberg's interest in Silicon Valley's latest fad. It's about his company's continued existence, which depends on attracting younger users.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe leaked internal documents show Facebook is worried about losing relevance as its user base grows older. People under 30 are spending less time on Facebook, posting less and sending fewer messages, according to an internal report prepared in March and reported on by Bloomberg.\n\nMeanwhile, Instagram, which the company views as a pipeline for younger users who will eventually age into its other apps, is losing teenagers to other social media platforms — a phenomenon the company identified as an \"existential threat,\" The New York Times reported.\n\nZuckerberg told investors on Monday that he's reorienting the company around appealing to young adults ages 18 to 29, rather than the older crowd that has become its core. He cited threats, including short-video app TikTok, which he said is \"one of the most effective competitors that we have ever faced.\"\n\nThe company's big corporate overhaul comes as Congress threatens to pass tougher regulations on the tech industry, with some lawmakers saying it has grown so big and powerful that it is like Big Tobacco in its heyday.\n\n\"Facebook is going through so much turmoil, so much negativity\" that the name change risks looking like \"you are trying to hide something,\" said Prashant Malaviya, a marketing professor at Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business.\n\nIndeed, critics were quick on Thursday to accuse the company of just that.\n\n\"The name change from Facebook to Meta may make sense from a commercial marketing perspective, but it's also a blatant attempt to distance Mark Zuckerberg's company from growing outrage over the harm it is causing to democracy in the U.S. and around the world,\" said Paul Barrett, deputy director of the NYU Stern Center for Business and Human Rights, in a statement. \"Zuckerberg and his lieutenants can't shed the Facebook albatross with a clever brand adjustment.\"\n\nChanging names often yields mixed results\n\nOther companies have changed their names in times of crisis, with mixed results. In 2001, when Marlboro cigarette-maker Philip Morris announced plans to rename itself Altria, a former Food and Drug Administration commissioner accused the company of \"running away from tobacco.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nMalaviya says the Altria rebranding worked at the corporate level — but he points out the company never attempted to change the name of Marlboro, the product people actually knew.\n\nSimilarly, the Facebook social network, known internally as the \"big blue app,\" isn't going anywhere.\n\n\"The Facebook brand is going to continue to exist. The app will be there. Instagram is still going to be there,\" Malaviya said. \"And that's where we have the problems with what the company is doing.\"\n\nIn 2015, Google reorganized under a new parent company called Alphabet, and its founders handed over the day-to-day running of its lucrative search engine — although the company is still widely referred to as Google.\n\nIf that history is any guide, Malaviya said, don't expect the name \"Facebook\" to disappear from conversation or headlines.\n\n\"Even if they're talking about this new company, the people on Wall Street and Main Street might still continue to say, 'Well, yeah, that's still just Facebook.' \"\n\nEditor's note: Facebook and Google are among NPR's recent financial supporters.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nFacebook replaced its corporate sign outside its California headquarters with one featuring the Meta logo.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Britons have criticized the EU for its handling of a range of issues, resent the loss of power to the Brussels-based institution and are divided among themselves about the institution they first joined in 1973.\n\nMore broadly, a Pew Research Center survey conducted this spring found that publics in a number of other EU countries share the British desire for a less, not more, centralized Europe, and that the debate about the future of the EU will not subside just because the UK has now voted.\n\nThe EU has never been as popular in the UK as it has been among other EU members. Just 44% of the public in the UK has a favorable view of the EU, compared with a median of 50% who hold a favorable opinion in five other EU nations surveyed by Pew Research Center. Support for the EU is down in the UK from a high of 52% in 2014. British views of the EU have consistently been lower than those on the continent for nearly a decade.\n\nThe British have long thought that the EU was inefficient and intrusive and has mishandled the challenges facing Europe. In a 2014 Pew Research Center survey, 64% of the British thought the EU was inefficient and does not understand the needs of its citizens. Six-in-ten said it was intrusive. In this year’s survey, 70% in the UK disapprove of the EU’s handling of the refugee issue and 55% said the same about the EU’s dealing with economic issues.\n\nThe vote to leave reflects the desire of nearly two-thirds of the UK public to bring back some EU powers from Brussels to London. Fully 65% of the British said before the referendum that they wanted some EU powers to be returned to their national government. This included 73% of those ages 50 and older, 70% of men, 68% of those with a secondary education or less, 93% of UK Independence Party supporters, 77% of Conservative Party adherents and 49% of Labour Party backers.\n\nThe Brexit vote exposes a rift in public opinion between the Scottish and people in the rest of the United Kingdom. The Scottish voted to stay in the EU by an overwhelming margin of 62% to 38%, putting a new Scottish independence referendum on the table. Pew Research Center data show that the Scottish are more likely than those in England, Northern Ireland and Wales to have a favorable opinion of the EU (53% versus 43% respectively).\n\nScotland also disagrees with the rest of the UK on two issues central to the Brexit debate: the economy and immigration. The Scottish feel more threatened by the prospect of global economic instability than their counterparts in the rest of the UK. Roughly six-in-ten say it is a major threat to their country, while only 48% say the same in England, Northern Ireland and Wales. Meanwhile, the rest of the UK feels more threatened by the large number of refugees leaving countries such as Iraq and Syria (54% major threat). Just 41% of Scottish people agree.\n\nThe rest of Europe sees Brexit as pivotal for the well-being of the EU. Before the referendum, a median of 70% said that they thought it would be a bad thing for the EU if the UK were to leave. This included 89% of the Swedes, 75% of the Dutch and 74% of the Germans.\n\nThe debate in other EU member states about the future of the institution may just be getting started. A majority of the Greeks (68%) and pluralities of the Dutch (44%), Germans (43%), Italians (39%) and French (39%) all want some EU power returned to their national governments. Both the Dutch and the French have a history of holding referendums on major and not-so-major issues, and Euroskeptic parties in both countries have already voiced support for a public vote on their relationship with the EU.\n\nNOTE (April 2017): After publication, the weight for the Netherlands data was revised to correct percentages for two regions. The impact of this revision on the Netherlands data included in this blog post is very minor and does not materially change the analysis. For a summary of changes, see here.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert at causal reasoning."}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n### CONTEXT\n[Doc 1]\nTitle: Among the Insurrectionists at the Capitol\nContent: Right-wing extremists justify such inconsistency by assigning the epithet “oath-breaker” to anyone in uniform who executes his duties in a manner they dislike. It is not difficult to imagine how, once Trump is no longer President, his most fanatical supporters could apply this caveat to all levels of government, including local law enforcement. At the rally on December 12th, Nicholas Fuentes underscored the irreconcilability of a radical-right ethos and pro-police, pro-military patriotism: “When they go door to door mandating vaccines, when they go door to door taking your firearms, when they go door to door taking your children, who do you think it will be that’s going to do that? It’s going to be the police and the military.”\n\nDuring Trump’s speech on January 6th, he said, “The media is the biggest problem we have.” He went on, “It’s become the enemy of the people. . . . We gotta get them straightened out.” Several journalists were attacked during the siege. Men assaulted a Times photographer inside the Capitol, near the rotunda, as she screamed for help. After National Guard soldiers and federal agents finally arrived and expelled the Trump supporters, some members of the mob shifted their attention to television crews in a park on the east side of the building. Earlier, a man had accosted an Israeli journalist in the middle of a live broadcast, calling him a “lying Israeli” and telling him, “You are cattle today.” Now the Trump supporters surrounded teams from the Associated Press and other outlets, chasing off the reporters and smashing their equipment with bats and sticks.\n\nThere was a ritualistic atmosphere as the crowd stood in a circle around the piled-up cameras, lights, and tripods. “This is the old media,” a man said, through a megaphone. “This is what it looks like. Turn off Fox, turn off CNN.”\n\nOutside the Capitol, rioters surrounded news crews, chasing off the reporters and smashing their equipment with bats. Photograph by Balazs Gardi for The New Yorker\n\nAnother man, in a black leather jacket and wraparound sunglasses, suggested that journalists should be killed: “Start makin’ a list! Put all those names down, and we start huntin’ them down, one by one!”\n\n“Traitors to the guillotine!”\n\n“They won’t be able to walk down the streets!”\n\nThe radicalization of the Republican Party has altered the world of conservative media, which is, in turn, accelerating that radicalization. On November 7th, Fox News, which has often seemed to function as a civilian branch of the Trump Administration, called the race for Biden, along with every other major network. Furious, Trump encouraged his supporters to instead watch Newsmax, whose ratings skyrocketed as a result. Newsmax hosts have dismissed covid-19 as a “scamdemic” and have speculated that Republican politicians were being infected with the virus as a form of “sabotage.” The Newsmax headliner Michelle Malkin has praised Fuentes as one of the “New Right leaders” and the groypers as “patriotic.”\n\nAt the December 12th rally, I ran into the Pennsylvania Three Percent member whom I’d met in Harrisburg on November 7th. Then he had been a Fox News devotee, but since Election Day he’d discovered Newsmax. “I’d had no idea what it even was,” he told me. “Now the only thing that anyone I know watches anymore is Newsmax. They ask the hard questions.”\n\nIt seems unlikely that what happened on January 6th will turn anyone who inhabits such an ecosystem against Trump. On the contrary, there are already indications that the mayhem at the Capitol will further isolate and galvanize many right-wingers. The morning after the siege, an alternative narrative, pushed by Jones and other conspiracists, went viral on Parler: the assault on the Capitol had actually been instigated by Antifa agitators impersonating Trump supporters. Mo Brooks, an Alabama congressman who led the House effort to contest the certification of the Electoral College votes, tweeted, “Evidence growing that fascist ANTIFA orchestrated Capitol attack with clever mob control tactics.” (Brooks had warmed up the crowd for Trump on January 6th, with a speech whose bellicosity far surpassed the President’s. “Today is the day American patriots start takin’ down names and kickin’ ass!” he’d hollered.) Most of the “evidence” of Antifa involvement seems to be photographs of rioters clad in black. Never mind that, in early January, Tarrio, the Proud Boys chairman, wrote on Parler, “We might dress in all BLACK for the occasion.” Or that his colleague Joe Biggs, addressing antifascist activists, added, “We are going to smell like you, move like you, and look like you.”\n\nNot long after the Brooks tweet, I got a call from a woman I’d met at previous Stop the Steal rallies. She had been unable to come to D.C., owing to a recent surgery. She asked if I could tell her what I’d seen, and if the stories about Antifa were accurate. She was upset—she did not believe that “Trump people” could have done what the media were alleging. Before I responded, she put me on speakerphone. I could hear other people in the room. We spoke for a while, and it was plain that they desperately wanted to know the truth. I did my best to convey it to them as I understood it.\n\nLess than an hour after we got off the phone, the woman texted me a screenshot of a CNN broadcast with a news bulletin that read, “antifa has taken responsiblitly for storming capital hill.” The image, which had been circulating on social media, was crudely Photoshopped (and poorly spelled). “Thought you might want to see this,” she wrote.\n\nIn the year 2088, a five-hundred-pound time capsule is scheduled to be exhumed from beneath the stone slabs of Freedom Plaza. Inside an aluminum cylinder, historians will find relics honoring the legacy of Martin Luther King, Jr.: a Bible, clerical robes, a cassette tape with King’s “I Have a Dream” speech, part of which he wrote in a nearby hotel. What will those historians know about the lasting consequences of the 2020 Presidential election, which culminated with the incumbent candidate inciting his supporters to storm the Capitol and threaten to lynch his adversaries? Will this year’s campaign against the democratic process have evolved into a durable insurgency? Something worse?\n\nOn January 8th, Trump was permanently banned from Twitter. Five days later, he became the only U.S. President in history to be impeached twice. (During the Capitol siege, the man in the hard hat withdrew from one of the Senate desks a manual, from a year ago, titled “PROCEEDINGS OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE IN THE IMPEACHMENT TRIAL OF PRESIDENT DONALD JOHN TRUMP.”) Although the President has finally agreed to submit to a peaceful transition of power, he has admitted no responsibility for the deadly riot. “People thought that what I said was totally appropriate,” he told reporters on January 12th.\n\nHe will not disappear. Neither will the baleful forces that he has conjured and awakened. This is why iconoclasts like Fuentes and Jones have often seemed more exultant than angry since Election Day. For them, the disappointment of Trump’s defeat has been eclipsed by the prospect of upheaval that it has brought about. As Fuentes said on the “InfoWars” panel, “This is the best thing that can happen, because it’s destroying the legitimacy of the system.” Fuentes was at the Capitol riot, though he denies going inside. On his show the next day, he called the siege “the most awe-inspiring and inspirational and incredible thing I have seen in my entire life.”\n\nAt the heap of wrecked camera gear outside the Capitol, the man in the leather jacket and sunglasses declared to the crowd, “We are at war. . . . Mobilize in your own cities, your own counties. Storm your own capitol buildings. And take down every one of these corrupt motherfuckers.” Behind him, lights glowed in the rotunda. The sky darkened. At 8 p.m., Congress reconvened and resumed certifying the election. For six hours, Americans had held democracy hostage in the name of patriotism.\n\nThe storm might be here. ♦\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nThe House and Senate recessed, and the Capitol was locked down.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

But they said Musk is in charge of the social media platform and has fired CEO Parag Agrawal, CFO Ned Segal and Chief Legal Counsel Vijaya Gadde. Neither person wanted to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the deal.\n\nThe departures come just hours before a deadline set by a Delaware judge to finalize the deal on Friday. She threatened to schedule a trial if no agreement was reached.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAlthough they came quickly, the major personnel moves had been widely expected and almost certainly are the first of many major changes the mercurial Tesla CEO will make.\n\nMusk privately clashed with Agrawal in April, immediately before deciding to make a bid for the company, according to text messages later revealed in court filings.\n\nAbout the same time, he used Twitter to criticize Gadde, the company's top lawyer. His tweets were followed by a wave of harassment of Gadde from other Twitter accounts. For Gadde, an 11-year Twitter employee who also heads public policy and safety, the harassment included racist and misogynistic attacks, in addition to calls for Musk to fire her. On Thursday, after she was fired, the harassing tweets lit up once again.\n\nMusk's changes will be aimed at increasing Twitter's subscriber base and revenue.\n\nIn his first big move earlier on Thursday, Musk tried to soothe leery Twitter advertisers saying that he is buying the platform to help humanity and doesn't want it to become a \"free-for-all hellscape.\"\n\nThe message appeared to be aimed at addressing concerns among advertisers — Twitter's chief source of revenue — that Musk's plans to promote free speech by cutting back on moderating content will open the floodgates to more online toxicity and drive away users.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"The reason I acquired Twitter is because it is important to the future of civilization to have a common digital town square, where a wide range of beliefs can be debated in a healthy manner, without resorting to violence,\" Musk wrote in an uncharacteristically long message for the Tesla CEO, who typically projects his thoughts in one-line tweets.\n\nHe continued: \"There is currently great danger that social media will splinter into far right wing and far left wing echo chambers that generate more hate and divide our society.\"\n\nMusk has previously expressed distaste for advertising and Twitter's dependence on it, suggesting more emphasis on other business models such as paid subscriptions that won't allow big corporations to dictate policy on how social media operates. But on Thursday, he assured advertisers he wants Twitter to be \"the most respected advertising platform in the world.\"\n\nThe note is a shift from Musk's position that Twitter is unfairly infringing on free speech rights by blocking misinformation or graphic content, said Pinar Yildirim, associate professor of marketing at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.\n\nBut it's also a realization that having no content moderation is bad for business, putting Twitter at risk of losing advertisers and subscribers, she said.\n\n\"You do not want a place where consumers just simply are bombarded with things they do not want to hear about, and the platform takes no responsibility,\" Yildirim said.\n\nMusk said Twitter should be \"warm and welcoming to all\" and enable users to choose the experience they want to have.\n\nFriday's deadline to close the deal was ordered by the Delaware Chancery Court in early October. It is the latest step in a battle that began in April with Musk signing a deal to acquire Twitter, then tried to back out of it, leading Twitter to sue the Tesla CEO to force him to go through with the acquisition. If the two sides don't meet Friday's deadline, the next step could be a November trial that could lead to a judge forcing Musk to complete the deal.\n\nBut Musk has been signaling that the deal is going through. He strolled into the company's San Francisco headquarters Wednesday carrying a porcelain sink, changed his Twitter profile to \"Chief Twit,\" and tweeted \"Entering Twitter HQ — let that sink in!\"\n\nAnd overnight the New York Stock Exchange notified investors that it will suspend trading in shares of Twitter before the opening bell Friday in anticipation of the company going private under Musk.\n\nMusk is expected to speak to Twitter employees directly Friday if the deal is finalized, according to an internal memo cited in several media outlets. Despite internal confusion and low morale tied to fears of layoffs or a dismantling of the company's culture and operations, Twitter leaders this week have at least outwardly welcomed Musk's arrival and messaging.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nTop sales executive Sarah Personette, the company's chief customer officer, said she had a \"great discussion\" with Musk on Wednesday and appeared to endorse his Thursday message to advertisers.\n\n\"Our continued commitment to brand safety for advertisers remains unchanged,\" Personette tweeted Thursday. \"Looking forward to the future!\"\n\nMusk's apparent enthusiasm about visiting Twitter headquarters this week stood in sharp contrast to one of his earlier suggestions: The building should be turned into a homeless shelter because so few employees actually worked there.\n\nThe Washington Post reported last week that Musk told prospective investors that he plans to cut three quarters of Twitter's 7,500 workers when he becomes owner of the company. The newspaper cited documents and unnamed sources familiar with the deliberation.\n\nMusk has spent months deriding Twitter's \"spam bots\" and making sometimes contradictory pronouncements about Twitter's problems and how to fix them. But he has shared few concrete details about his plans for the social media platform.\n\nThursday's note to advertisers shows a newfound emphasis on advertising revenue, especially a need for Twitter to provide more \"relevant ads\" — which typically means targeted ads that rely on collecting and analyzing users' personal information.\n\nYildirim said that, unlike Facebook, Twitter has not been good at targeting advertising to what users want to see. Musk's message suggests he wants to fix that, she said.\n\nInsider Intelligence principal analyst Jasmine Enberg said Musk has good reason to avoid a massive shakeup of Twitter's ad business because Twitter's revenues have taken a beating from the weakening economy, months of uncertainty surrounding Musk's proposed takeover, changing consumer behaviors and the fact that \"there's no other revenue source waiting in the wings.\"\n\n\"Even slightly loosening content moderation on the platform is sure to spook advertisers, many of whom already find Twitter's brand safety tools to be lacking compared with other social platforms,\" Enberg said.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nOn December 20, Musk confirmed he will step down as CEO upon finding a replacement and will manage software/servers teams.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA. Musk issued an ultimatum requiring employees to work \"extremely hardcore\" or resign, leading to approximately 1,200 employee resignations.\nB. Elon Musk signed a deal to acquire Twitter in April.\nC. Musk confirmed charging $8/month for Twitter Blue check marks and removed ID verification.\nD.

In a shock twist, a rebellion led by Wagner Group chief Yevgeny Prigozhin appeared on Saturday to develop into a short-lived military coup. After seizing official buildings in the southern city of Rostov-on-Don — which borders Ukraine and is an important logistical hub for the Kremlin’s war effort — and launching a column of armored vehicles towards Moscow, Prigozhin announced Saturday evening that he was halting the march towards the capital and that his soldiers would retreat to their camps “to avoid bloodshed.”\n\nAt the end of a frenetic day, the Kremlin announced that it planned to drop all charges against Prigozhin and the soldiers who took part in the uprising. And that the Wagner leader, whose whereabouts Putin’s spokesman said were unknown, would be allowed to take refuge in Belarus.\n\nPrigozhin’s rebellion against the Defense Ministry, which turned into the first coup attempt Russia has seen in three decades, has weakened Russian President Vladimir Putin and his regime as it faces the Ukrainian counteroffensive.\n\n“Now the moment has come when blood can be shed,” said Prigozhin in an audio broadcast on one of his Telegram channels. “Therefore, realizing all the responsibility for the fact that Russian blood will be shed from one side, we will turn our convoys around and go in the opposite direction to our field camps.”\n\nAccording to Western intelligence sources, behind-the-scenes negotiations with the mercenary chief to halt the march took place all day long. Since Saturday morning, Prigozhin escalated his defiance and rebellion by seizing the center of the border town of Rostov-on-Don and then ignored Putin’s warnings to stand down.\n\nBelarusian President Aleksandr Lukashenko claimed credit for negotiating the deal, saying in a statement that an “absolutely profitable and acceptable” agreement had been reached and that he had been given unspecified “security guarantees” for the mercenaries. Prigozhin’s revolt was extremely risky: the businessman does not have the support of the elites.\n\nDuring Friday night and Saturday day, Prigozhin crossed his own personal Rubicon. Backed into a corner by his escalating dispute with Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, he launched a rebellion that, even if it has fizzled out now, could not be without consequences. President Putin — who until Saturday had permitted Prigozhin’s quarrels with his defense minister — charged against the mercenaries chief, accusing Prigozhin of treason and “stabbing the Russian people in the back.” He promised to crush the coup, promising to “decisive action” to stabilize the situation.\n\nPrigozhin and his mercenaries met little opposition in their march towards Moscow. There were several attacks from the air with regular army helicopters, gunfire from a fighter plane and two fuel tanks were blown up to hinder their advance. The uprising is the most serious threat the Kremlin has faced since the Chechen war two decades ago. The situation may fuel internal conflicts in Russia, triggered by the defeats of the Kremlin forces in Ukraine and the lack of means, material and preparation of Russia’s troops. Prigozhin has denounced all these problems in a constant litany that has helped him gain greater visibility.\n\nThe Wagner crisis and its resolution are of grave geopolitical importance, given Russia possesses one of the world’s largest arsenals of nuclear weapons. Globally, it was met with a muted global reaction. The G-7 countries held an emergency call and, together with the EU and NATO allies, said they were closely monitoring the situation. But they did not venture to say more, fearing the Kremlin could use their words in their rhetoric against the West. Instead, they described the situation as an “internal problem” for Russia. Meanwhile, Russia’s Foreign Ministry warned Western countries against trying to “exploit” the Wagner Group rebellion “to achieve their Russophobic goals.”\n\nRussian authorities on Saturday declared an “anti-terrorist operations regime” in Moscow, which allowed them to close roads, monitor conversations and restrict movement. Before Prigozhin announced an end to the Wagner Group’s so-called “march for justice,” Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin declared that next Monday would be a non-working day — except for security forces and city services — and urged citizens to avoid the streets.\n\nIn a fiery speech on Saturday, Putin lashed out at what he considered the mercenary leader’s betrayal — until now, Prigozhin had been loyal to the Russian president and left him out of his verbal attacks against Shoigu, Moscow elites and “corrupt bureaucrats.” Without mentioning Prigozhin by name, Putin compared Saturday’s uprising to the 1917 revolution that destroyed the Russian Empire, “when the country was fighting World War I, but its victory was stolen.”\n\n“We will not let this happen again. We will protect our people and state from any threats, including internal betrayal. What we’re facing is exactly a betrayal,” said Putin in a five-minute speech broadcast Saturday morning on state TV. “Big ambitions and personal interests led to treason. Betrayal of one’s own country and people and of the cause that fighters of Wagner were dying for alongside our soldiers.”\n\n“Any internal mutiny is a deadly threat to our state, to us as a nation. It’s a blow against Russia, against our people. And our actions to defend the fatherland from such a threat will be brutal,” said Putin, who added that security forces had been ordered to regain control of the city of Rostov-on-Don. Information from flight tracking and registration websites showed that at least two aircraft of the fleet that carries the Kremlin leadership flew from Moscow to St. Petersburg on Saturday afternoon. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov maintained that Putin was still in the capital.\n\nIn response to Putin’s speech, Prigozhin released an audio message on his Telegram channels, in which he argued that the Russian president was “sorely mistaken” and defended Wagner mercenaries as the true patriots of Russia. “No one is going to give themselves up at the request of the president, the [Russian secret service] FSB or anyone else. We don’t want this country to go on living in corruption, deception and bureaucracy,” said Prigozhin, hours before standing down, in a heated message against military elites, whom he accuses of sending Russian troops unprepared into the “meat grinder” of Ukraine.\n\nThe decision to retreat was opposed by some members of the Wagner Group, who have accused Prigozhin of being a politician “like the rest” and of “incriminating” the mercenaries with his rebellion. Messages from mercenaries claiming they were breaking their contract with Wagner went viral on some Telegram channels, although local media footage from Rostov-on-Don, which acted as a base for the mercenaries on Saturday, showed several of them relaxing and talking to citizens.\n\nWindow of opportunity for Ukrainian counteroffensive\n\nWagner’s rebellion may have major consequences for the war in Ukraine due to its implication for frontline troops and the fact that it comes at a decisive moment for the Ukrainian counteroffensive. Ukrainian Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Maliar said Saturday that the rebellion, which exposes the cracks already pervading Russian society, is a “window of opportunity” for her forces. The decision to launch the full-scale invasion of Ukraine has triggered “the inevitable degradation of the Russian state,” she said.\n\nKyiv, which estimates that Moscow keeps some 400,000 Russian military personnel deployed in Ukraine, welcomed the instability in the invading country. “Everything is just beginning in Russia,” Mykhailo Podolyak, a top adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said Saturday, referring to the divisions shaking the neighboring country. According to Podolyak, it was impossible for both sides to emerge unscathed from the revolt: either the Kremlin or Prigozhin had to be defeated.\n\n“The split between the elites is now too obvious,” said Podolyak. “Someone must lose.” In a message on Twitter, the adviser also pointed out that the “counter-terrorist operation” had already resulted in the seizure of Rostov, a number of federal highways and the military headquarters of the Southern District.\n\nBritish intelligence reports say that Russia is facing its biggest domestic challenge in years, in which the degree of the military’s loyalty to the Kremlin will be key. The well-known enmity between Prigozhin and the Kremlin has escalated to “military confrontation” and the passivity with which some Russian military personnel have accepted the mercenary uprising suggests that they accept it, according to the report.\n\nThe head of the Wagner mercenary organization, Yevgeny Prigozhin, has declared his rebellion against the Russian military leadership on Saturday after accusing the Armed Forces of bombing one of his camps.

After months of insults and veiled accusations that he had been outgunned in the Battle of Bakhmut, Prigozhin recorded a video on Thursday in which he accused the minister of lying about Russia’s “successful” defense on the Zaporizhzhia front. “A huge amount of territory is lost. Soldiers have been killed, three, four times more than what it says in documents shown to the top,” said the Wagner Group chief.\n\nBefore Prigozhin announced a halt to the march, the Head of the Chechen Republic Ramzan Kadyrov broke his silence and placed his Praetorian Guard at the Kremlin’s disposal. “The fighters of the Ministry of Defense and the Russian Guard in the Chechen Republic have already left for the zones of tension,” he said on Telegram. “We will do everything to preserve the unity of Russia and protect its statehood! The rebellion must be crushed, and if this requires harsh measures, then we are ready!”\n\nSign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage from EL PAÍS USA Edition\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nWagner troops withdrew from Rostov, the Lipetsk region, and Moscow.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

The quake's epicentre was at a depth of just 10 km (6.2 miles), according to the United States Geological Survey.\n\n\"This is very damaging because it has occurred at a shallow depth, so the shockwaves are not dissipated as they go from the focus of the earthquake up to the surface. The buildings received the full force of the shaking.\"\n\n\"It's important not to be focused on epicentres because the seismic waves don't radiate out from the epicentre - they radiate out from the whole line of the fault,\" he added.\n\n## Earthquake today LIVE: UN mobilizing in southeast Asia, its chief says\n\nEarthquake today LIVE: UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Friday that the world body is mobilizing in Southeast Asia to help those in need after a 7.7 magnitude earthquake rocked Myanmar and Thailand.\n\n\"The government of Myanmar has asked for international support, and our team in Myanmar is already in contact in order to fully mobilize our resources in the region to support the people of Myanmar,\" Reuters quoted Guterres as saying.\n\n\"But of course, there are other countries impacted. The epicenter is in Myanmar, and Myanmar is the weakest country in this present situation,\" he added.\n\n## Earthquake today LIVE: US agency analysis predicts thousands of deaths\n\nEarthquake today LIVE: A predictive analysis from a US agency based on the strength and depth of Friday's earthquake in Myanmar and Thailand estimated there could be thousands of deaths and severe economic loss, with Myanmar's Sagaing and Meiktila regions worst hit.\n\n\"Overall, the population in this region resides in structures that are vulnerable to earthquake shaking, though resistant structures exist,\" the USGS analysis said.\n\n## Earthquake today LIVE: What junta chief said\n\nEarthquake today LIVE: The death toll and the number of injuries are likely to rise, junta chief Min Aung Hlaing said in a video speech on state broadcaster MRTV.\n\n“In some areas, buildings collapsed so rescue efforts are still under way,” he said. “As we carry out extensive rescue and relief efforts, I would like to request help.”\n\n## Earthquake today LIVE: 144 dead, over 700 injured in Myanmar; junta chief calls for foreign aid\n\nEarthquake today LIVE: At least 144 people have been killed in Myanmar due to the massive earthquake that hit the country on Friday, the ruling junta chief said, reported AFP.\n\nThe chief, Min Aung Hlaing, also invited \"any country, any organisation\" to help with relief efforts and warned that the toll could go up in a speech aired on state media.\n\n## Earthquake today LIVE: Monastery hit in Madalay\n\nEarthquake today LIVE: The earthquake in Myanmar reportedly brought down multiple buildings in Mandalay, including the Ma Soe Yane monastery.\n\nA video shared on social media showed monks in the street shooting video of the multistory monastery before it suddenly fell to the ground.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert at causal reasoning."}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n### CONTEXT\n[Doc 1]\nTitle: The Texas Power Grid and the Failure of Deregulation\nContent: By now, the early message that the electricity blackout in Texas was a failure of renewable energy has been replaced by the far more complex reality of a grid not prepared for extreme weather. Texas takes pride in its free market–fueled economic environment that provides low-cost housing, cheap electricity, and plenty of personal transportation along with low taxes. The problem is that the absence of rules and governance can come back and create harm if you happen to live on a more crowded and complex planet, like the one we have here on Earth. Climate change, pandemics, traffic jams, toxic air, polluted water and poisoned land cannot be addressed by the free market alone. The market can be used to produce needed goods and services, but the idea that markets and civilization itself can survive without rules is absurd idiocy.\n\nTexas this past week was a case in point. The electric grid in Texas is built for efficiency, but it is not built for climate resilience. As Katherine Blunt and Russell Gold reported in the Wall Street Journal:\n\n“A fundamental flaw in the freewheeling Texas electricity market left millions powerless and freezing in the dark this week during a historic cold snap. The core problem: Power providers can reap rewards by supplying electricity to Texas customers, but they aren’t required to do it and face no penalties for failing to deliver during a lengthy emergency. That led to the fiasco that left millions of people in the nation’s second-most-populous state without power for days. A severe storm paralyzed almost every energy source, from power plants to wind turbines, because their owners hadn’t made the investments needed to produce electricity in subfreezing temperatures. While power providers collectively failed, the companies themselves didn’t break any rules.”\n\nThe quest for efficiency and low cost led to under-investment and energy facilities poorly prepared for cold weather. Texas does better in hot weather, but climate change is altering weather patterns and extreme weather events are becoming more common. While we need to mitigate climate change and will need government-driven public policy to do that, we must also adapt to the climate change that is already underway. That need to adapt also requires a more active government presence than the ideologues running Texas want to allow.\n\nEnergy is not the only industry damaged by uncontrolled market forces. Health care is also suffering from the impact of health insurance companies on hospitals and medical care. The shortage of intensive care beds during the COVID-19 pandemic can be traced to efforts to enhance cost-effectiveness in hospitals. Extra capacity is considered waste that must be reflected in the price of care. Eliminate that capacity and costs can be reduced. Instead of paying for and storing extra personal protective equipment, hospitals utilize just-in-time supply chains to meet immediate needs. The system worked well until a pandemic hit and the supply chains could not meet dramatically increased demand.\n\nI am not arguing against just-in-time production or global supply chains, but rather for adequate public investment in infrastructure and supplies to meet the needs of emergencies. The public interest requires rules that may inhibit unfettered markets, but if regulations are designed with care, we can retain the benefits brought by the competitive marketplace. In some instances, we won’t need regulation but instead, require public infrastructure investment. For example, a more resilient electric grid could consist of thousands of microgrids knitted together into a national smart grid. Some of the capital for rebuilding the grid could come from federal infrastructure investment- the type needed to revive the American economy. The modern grid will produce energy at lower costs, making our economy more productive. A more robust system of public health will require enhanced local virus testing, tracing and isolation capacity and biological scanning of air travelers by the TSA. Travelers can fund the TSA, but local taxes will need to pay for local public health capacity.\n\nTo resume and maintain our way of life in a complex, interconnected global economy, we will need to develop a set of rules and build the institutional capacity needed to protect us from 21st-century threats. These range from terrorism to pandemics to the impact of extreme weather events. Our ability to enjoy the benefits of modern technology requires that public management become more effective and efficient. It is time to reject the idea that government is the problem and the solution to our problems is to “starve the beast” and disinvest in the public sector. That may have been an answer to some of the issues faced by Ronald Reagan and his contemporaries in 1980, but it is completely inadequate to the issues we are facing four decades later.\n\nDeregulation has failed. But reimposing rigid rules is unlikely to result in better outcomes. We need to develop incentives and disincentives that result in private behaviors that meet the requirements of the public interest. Some of that is pure command and control regulation. Every traffic system requires some traffic lights. But, tax credits and deductions, public investments, government-funded research and other forms of subsidies must be designed to achieve public ends rather than reward powerful interests. This will not be easy to do. We need to develop regulatory strategies that incentivize private behaviors to meet public needs. One size does not fit all, and we need to recognize that in formulating and implementing regulation.\n\nOur ability to measure performance is far greater than it was in the middle of the 20th century. The technology of observation, communication and information has advanced dramatically and can enable more targeted and effective rules. Remote sensing can replace human inspections and some auditing functions can be automated. We need to apply ingenuity and design to more effective and flexible policies and public investments. Effective public management requires financial investment, brainpower and political will. We should use the market to meet our needs rather than worship the market as the solution to all problems.\n\nA year of COVID-19 lockdown has demonstrated the inadequacy of what remains of our public sector. Our unwillingness to tax ourselves and invest in public sector infrastructure or organizational capacity has resulted in disease, death and trillions of dollars of economic damage. Last week in Texas, the free market in energy delivered cold and misery. For the past year, we have struggled to contain a virus that could have been isolated and eliminated with a more robust, competent system of public health. The benefits of modern technology bring costs. We need to understand those negative impacts and protect ourselves from them.\n\nIn a world where disinformation abounds and reality has become controversial, it will be a challenge to develop a more sophisticated, fact-based system of governance. A large number of Americans do not believe that our climate is changing and do not believe that COVID-19 is real. They think that Donald Trump’s reelection was stolen by nefarious forces and that the January 6th insurrection was led by Antifa. Despite these fact-free accounts, hundreds of insurrectionists are headed to courtrooms, thousands of COVID victims have died and millions of climate deniers in Texas suffered last week from the impact of climate-induced extreme weather. My hope is that Americans will accept reality and reject ideology. We need pragmatism and we need to be willing to pay the hand we are dealt. We saw signs of that in the recent election and in the poll data that indicates 70% of the country favors the Biden pandemic relief package. America’s government is a sleeping giant that seems to be slowly waking up from decades of slumber.\n\nViews and opinions expressed here are those of the authors, and do not necessarily reflect the official position of the Columbia Climate School, Earth Institute or Columbia University.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nRegional power generators spontaneously shut down, including three coal plants and a gas plant in Corpus Christi.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Our 20 years of sacrifice worked.\"\n\nIn Washington, Gen. Frank McKenzie, head of U.S. Central Command, announced the completion of America's longest war and the evacuation effort, saying the last planes took off from Kabul airport at 3:29 p.m. EDT — one minute before midnight Monday in Kabul.\n\n\"We did not get everybody out that we wanted to get out,\" he said.\n\nWith its last troops gone, the U.S. ended its 20-year war with the Taliban back in power. Many Afghans remain fearful of their rule or of further instability, and there have been sporadic reports of killings and other abuses in areas under Taliban control despite the group's pledges to restore peace and security.\n\n\"American soldiers left the Kabul airport, and our nation got its full independence,\" Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said early Tuesday.\n\nThe U.S. and its allies invaded Afghanistan shortly after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attack on the United States, which al-Qaida orchestrated while sheltering under Taliban rule. The invasion drove the Taliban from power in a matter of weeks and scattered Osama bin Laden and other top al-Qaida leaders.\n\nThe U.S. and its allies launched an ambitious effort to rebuild Afghanistan after decades of war, investing billions of dollars in a Western-style government and security forces. Women, who had been largely confined to their homes under the Taliban's hard-line rule, benefited from access to education and came to assume prominent roles in public life.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBut the Taliban never went away.\n\nIn the coming years, as the U.S. focused on another troubled war in Iraq and the Afghan government became mired in corruption, the Taliban regrouped in the countryside and in neighboring Pakistan. In recent years, they seized large parts of rural Afghanistan and carried out near-daily assaults on Afghan security forces.\n\nEager to end the war, the Trump administration signed a peace deal with the Taliban in February 2020 that paved the way for the withdrawal. President Joe Biden extended the deadline from May to August and continued with the pullout despite the Taliban's rapid blitz across the country earlier this month.\n\nNow the Taliban control all of Afghanistan except for the mountainous Panjshir province, where a few thousand local fighters and remnants of Afghanistan's collapsed security forces have pledged to resist them. The Taliban say they are seeking a peaceful resolution there.\n\nThey face much graver challenges now that they govern one of the poorest and most war-ravaged nations on Earth.\n\nIn recent days Afghans have lined up outside banks as an economic crisis that predates the Taliban takeover worsens. A string of attacks by the Islamic State extremist group's local affiliate, including a barrage of rockets fired at the airport Monday, shows the security challenges the Taliban face.\n\nOn Thursday, an Islamic State suicide attack at an airport gate killed at least 169 Afghans and 13 U.S. service members. The extremist group is far more radical than the Taliban, and the two groups have fought each other before. The Taliban say they will prevent Afghanistan from again being used as a base for terror attacks, a pledge that will likely be tested soon.\n\nMcKenzie said the Taliban were \"significantly helpful\" in enabling the airlift but will have difficulty securing Kabul in the coming days, not least because of the threat they face from IS. He said the Taliban had freed IS fighters from prisons, swelling their ranks to an estimated 2,000.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"Now they are going to be able to reap what they sowed,\" the American general said.\n\nMany Afghans fear the Taliban themselves, who governed the country under a harsh interpretation of Islamic law from 1996 until 2001. In those years they banned television and music, barred women from attending school or working outside the home, and carried out public executions.\n\nThe Taliban have sought to project a more moderate image since the takeover. They say women will be able to attend school and work, and have renounced any revenge attacks on Afghans who worked with the former government, the U.S. or its allies.\n\nMany Afghans are deeply skeptical of such promises, and fear of the Taliban's rule drove tens of thousands to flee the country over the past two weeks. Thousands more waited in vain outside the airport, many of them standing for hours in a sewage canal.\n\nThe Kabul international airport had been one of the few ways out. At one point people flooded onto the tarmac and seven fell to their deaths after clinging to a plane that was taking off. Another seven died in a stampede of people outside an airport gate.\n\nThe Taliban have said they will allow normal travel, but it is unclear how they will run the airport and which commercial carriers will begin flying in, given security concerns.\n\nQatar, a close U.S. ally that has long hosted a Taliban political office, has been taking part in negotiations about operations at the airport with Afghan and international parties, mainly the U.S. and Turkey. Qatari Assistant Foreign Minister Lolwa al-Khater said its main priority is restoring regular operations while maintaining security at the airport.\n\nThe last known U.S. military operation in Afghanistan came Sunday, when American officials said a drone strike blew up a vehicle carrying IS suicide bombers who were planning to attack the airport.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBut like so much about the Afghanistan war, it may not have gone as planned.\n\nRelatives of those killed in Sunday's strike said it killed civilians who had nothing to do with the extremist group.\n\nNajibullah Ismailzada said his brother-in-law, Zemarai Ahmadi, had just arrived home from his job working with a Korean charity. As he drove into the garage, his children came out to greet him, and that is when the missile struck.\n\n\"We lost 10 members of our family,\" Ismailzada said, including six children raging in age from 2 to 8. He said another relative, Naser Nejrabi, who was a former soldier in the Afghan army and a former interpreter for the U.S. military, also was killed, along with two teenagers.\n\nU.S. officials have acknowledged the reports of civilian casualties without confirming them.\n\nHours before the withdrawal was complete, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the U.S. military takes steps to avoid civilian casualties when carrying out targeted strikes.\n\n\"Of course, the loss of life from anywhere is horrible, and it impacts families no matter where they're living, in the United States or around the world,\" she said.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nTaliban fighters celebrated following the U.S. departure.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

In Oregon, officials were expanding evacuation zones in Clackamas County, as two wildfires were expected to merge and have the potential to advance toward some of Portland’s southeastern suburbs.\n\nThe community of Mollala was ordered to evacuate, while more heavily populated areas were placed in Level 1, or “Be Ready,” evacuation zones. On Thursday afternoon local time, firefighters were repositioning to defend communities in case the fires grow and make a run down into lower elevations.\n\nWeather was expected to improve, with slackening winds compared with the howling gales that led to so many rapidly spreading blazes at once. However, according to Oregon Gov. Kate Brown (D) and fire officials, active fire spread continues there as shifting winds allow some blazes to spread.\n\nAt least seven people, including a 1-year-old boy, have died in California, Oregon and Washington state amid the dozens of wildfires burning throughout the varied landscapes of the American West, officials announced Wednesday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrown said more than 900,000 acres have burned in 72 hours across her state, far above the typical annual average of 500,000 acres in the state. “We have never seen this amount of uncontained fire across the state,” Brown said at a news conference Thursday. Some 30,000 to 40,000 residents have evacuated due to the fires, she said.\n\nWildfires are starting and spreading throughout California, Oregon and Washington state. (Video: The Washington Post)\n\nThe fires have stretched state and local firefighters’ resources to the limit in Oregon, and Brown has requested a battalion of firefighters from the Defense Department as well as firefighters from other states to help gain control of the blazes.\n\nBrown said these fires are unprecedented, but they carry a clear message on climate change.\n\n“It is the bellwether of the future. We are feeling the acute impacts of climate change. We are seeing its acute impacts in Oregon, on the West Coast and frankly in the entire world,” Brown said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials in northern Washington state announced that a 1-year-old boy died and his parents were severely burned in the Cold Springs Fire. Okanogan County Sheriff Tony Hawley said in a news conference that his office received a call Tuesday afternoon about Jacob and Jamie Hyland, a young couple from Renton, Wash., who were reported missing while visiting Okanogan with their son.\n\nHawley said the family attempted to escape the fire as it approached the property where they were staying. Rescuers first found their truck, which was burned and wrecked, and then located the family on the bank of the Columbia River on Wednesday morning.\n\nThe parents had third-degree burns and were flown to a Seattle hospital for treatment.\n\nThe smoke from the siege of blazes was fouling air quality in California, Oregon and Washington. The U.S. government’s Air Quality Index showed large areas of code-red or “unhealthy” air quality in all three states. In California and Oregon, pockets of code purple and amber, signifying very unhealthy and hazardous pollution levels, were present. Pollution levels near Salem, Ore., were the highest on the planet, based on values reported to the international database at the website waqi.info.\n\nOregon fires\n\nIn southwestern Oregon, wildfires continued to burn across thousands of acres, including in timber-dominated ecosystems in a part of the typically rainy state where such fires are relatively rare. With some blazes, such as the nearly 160,000-acre Santiam Fire, emerging evidence suggests that downed power lines from strong winds played a role in helping flames spread.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFour wildfires were threatening communities in Clackamas County, prompting expanding evacuations, including of some Portland suburbs.\n\nThe remains of one person were found in Ashland, and the Glendower Fire that affected Medford, Talent and Phoenix has prompted a criminal investigation to determine whether it was deliberately sparked.\n\nIn Mehama, Ore., a 12-year-old boy and his grandmother were killed trying to flee the Santiam Fire on Wednesday, which stood at 159,000 acres and zero percent containment as of Thursday morning.\n\nFamily members confirmed to KPTV that 12-year-old Wyatt Tofte and his grandmother, Peggy Mosso, died inside their car next to the family’s home. Wyatt’s mother suffered severe burns and remained in critical condition, family members told KGW.\n\nThe National Weather Service forecast office in Medford predicted shifting winds and continued hot and dry conditions Thursday, but the strong winds that have characterized the past few days of historic fire spread were finally dying down. There is even some rain in the forecast for early next week.\n\n“We’ll see winds shift from east to southeast or northwest to west to northwest in the afternoon,” the NWS stated in a technical discussion. “It will remain dry today with plenty of smoke covering most of the forecast area.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe forecast high for Medford was 100 degrees, but in a sign of how dense the smoke is, the NWS said that temperature might not be reached, because the smoke is absorbing and scattering much of the incoming solar radiation.\n\nCalifornia fires\n\nIn California, at least three people have died and 12 remained missing in the Bear Fire, now called the North Complex West Zone, which advanced about 25 miles in 24 hours between Tuesday and Wednesday, threatening to burn into Oroville. That fire has damaged or destroyed about 2,000 structures, according to Cal Fire, the state firefighting agency.\n\nThe fire is part of the larger North Complex Fire, which has rapidly become the state’s 10th-largest blaze on record, burning about 247,358 acres through Thursday morning, with 23 percent containment. The fire burned through timber, much of it dead trees that were weakened or killed off by the drought that affected the state from 2011 to 2017. In a single day, it consumed over 200,000 acres.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nButte County Sheriff Kory Honea said in a news conference Wednesday that two of the three dead were found in the same location. The other victim was discovered near Berry Creek by a California Highway Patrol officer who suspected they fled from their car in an unsuccessful attempt to escape the fire, the San Jose Mercury News reported. The sheriff’s office was working to identify the victims and notify their families, Honea said.\n\nSmoke was so thick that it turned the sky orange across the San Francisco Bay area Wednesday, with birds failing to sense daybreak.\n\nWe’re in uncharted territory\n\nAs of Thursday, California had seen more than 3.1 million acres burned this year, the largest amount of land on record — with the heart of the Southern California fire season still to come.\n\nCal Fire released a slew of statistics Thursday showing just how severe the fires have been. An astonishing 3.1 million acres have burned this year, which is up from a total of 2.5 million acres as of Wednesday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere have been 12 wildfire-related fatalities this year. More than 3,900 structures have been destroyed.\n\nSix of the 20 largest wildfires in California history have occurred in 2020.\n\nThese fires include the August Complex (No. 1), SCU Lightning Complex (No. 3), LNU Lightning Complex (No. 4), North Complex (No. 10) and Creek Fire (No. 17).\n\nIn addition, the LNU complex and the August Complex both are among the 10 most destructive fires in state history.\n\nThe simultaneous outbreak of fires across such a large expanse, plus the staggering speeds with which these fires advanced, have led wildfire experts to call this an unprecedented event in modern times. The only comparable event mentioned is the Big Blowup of 1910, when a massive blaze swept across parts of Montana and Idaho, according to Nick Nauslar, a predictive-services meteorologist with the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho.\n\n“Multiple fires made 20-plus mile runs in 24 hours over the last few days in California, Oregon and Washington,” Nauslar said. Such distances traveled so quickly may not be all that rare in grassland fires, Nauslar noted. “However, most of these fires are making massive runs in timber and burning tens of thousands of acres and in some cases 100,000-plus acres in one day,” he said. “The sheer amount of fire on the landscape is surreal, and no one I have talked to can remember anything like it.”\n\nIn addition to the 3.1 million acres burned in California, 954,000 acres have been lost in Oregon and 500,000 in Washington state.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe wildfires come after a record-shattering heat wave that sent temperatures across the region soaring through the triple digits, and amid human-caused climate change that is heightening fire risks in the West.\n\nThese blazes have been driven by strong, dry, offshore winds that contributed to extreme fire behavior, producing mushroom-cloud-like plumes of smoke that reach 40,000 feet in height and fire tornadoes that make it impossible for firefighters to contain an advancing blaze.\n\nAfter a mid-August heat wave and wildfire outbreak in California, the heat wave that struck the region in the past week dried vegetation out to a record extent, priming it for burning.\n\nJohn Abatzoglou, a climate researcher at the University of California at Merced, noted that one key fire index that measures the thirst of the atmosphere showed record-setting conditions across a vast expanse of the West this week. As he explained on Twitter, the vapor-pressure deficit “is the difference between how much moisture the air can hold (which increases nonlinearly with temperature) and how much moisture is in the air.”\n\nExtremely low vapor pressure means conditions are hot and the air is extremely dry. This, combined with an early-season down-sloping wind event, helped lead to this wildfire outbreak — once sparks lit new blazes and winds hit preexisting fires.\n\nA study published in August shows climate change is increasing the risk of extreme wildfire conditions during the fall season in California. The state’s frequency of fall days with extreme fire-weather conditions has more than doubled since the 1980s, the study found.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe unprecedented fires have forced authorities to take previously unheard-of actions.\n\nFollowing the rescue of hundreds of stranded hikers, campers and others from the advancing Creek Fire earlier in the week, the U.S. Forest Service announced the closure of all 18 national forests in California on Wednesday afternoon in response to “unprecedented and historic fire conditions.”\n\nThe closures cover more than 20 million acres of forest, an area about 26 times the size of Rhode Island.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nThe Almeda Fire burned hundreds of homes and businesses in Phoenix and Talent, Oregon.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA. Wildfires across the West Coast have caused at least 24 deaths and placed hundreds of thousands under evacuation orders.\nB. None of the others are correct causes.\nC.

There was only one firearm-related death in all of 2021. Since 2017, there have been 14 gun-related deaths, a remarkably low figure for a country of 125 million people.\n\nExpressing a common reaction, Erika Inoue, a 25-year-old designer in Tokyo, said the gun violence was hard to process.\n\n“The shooting part is confusing,” she said. “There are guns? In Japan?”\n\nJapan’s firearms law states that, in principle, guns are not permitted in the country. There are exceptions for guns used in hunting, but the process of getting a license is time-consuming and expensive, so very few people go through the hassle.\n\nA person must pass 12 steps before purchasing a firearm, starting with a gun-safety class and then passing a written exam administered three times a year. A doctor must sign off on the gun buyer’s physical and mental health. Other steps include an extensive background check and a police inspection of the gun safe and ammunition locker required for storing firearms and bullets.\n\nImage A security officer apprehending the suspect in the shooting of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Friday. The weapon, a handmade gun, can be seen as it falls from the suspect’s hand. Credit... The Asahi Shimbun, via Getty Images\n\nThe shooting was all the more shocking because before Friday, even the idea of a political murder seemed like a relic of a long-gone era.\n\nTempers rarely run high in Japan’s famously sedate politics. Parliamentary debates usually don’t move beyond cat calls and faux outrage and even the ultra-right-wing groups that regularly prowl city streets in black vans, blaring political propaganda, are viewed as more of a nuisance than a threat to public safety.\n\nPolice protection at political events is light, and during campaign season, voters have plenty of opportunities to interact with the country’s top leaders. Videos showed Friday’s suspected shooter walking unobstructed in proximity of the former prime minister and firing a handmade gun.\n\nLocal Japanese police said the handmade gun used in the shooting was more than a foot long and eight inches in height. They also said they seized several handmade guns in a search of the suspect’s home.\n\nUnlike the United States, where gun rights are a constant topic of debate, firearms are rarely discussed in Japanese political circles. Mass killings — in the rare instances when they occur — usually do not involve guns. Instead, perpetrators resort to arson or stabbings.\n\nIn recent weeks, Japanese media watched the spate of mass shootings in the United States with a mix of disbelief and confusion. After the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, The Asahi Shimbun, Japan’s second-largest newspaper by circulation, published an editorial calling the United States “a gun society” and said that another tragedy had turned a classroom into a “gun massacre zone.”\n\nImage Police investigating the site where a knife-wielding man killed a police officer, then used the officer’s gun to fatally shoot a security guard, in Toyama prefecture in 2018. Credit... Jiji Press/via Agence France-Presse — Getty Images\n\nToyo Keizai, a prominent weekly business magazine and website, published an article last year after the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol asking: “Why is ‘Gun Ownership’ a Non-Negotiable Right in the U.S.?”\n\n“It is difficult for Japanese to understand why gun ownership continues in the U.S. even with such a high number of victims,” journalist Keiko Tsuyama said in the article.\n\nMost Japanese people almost never encounter guns in day-to-day life even though police officers carry firearms. And until Mr. Abe’s shooting, Japan had almost no experience with the emotional and political aftermath of gun violence — something that has become a familiar ritual in the United States.\n\nIn 2021, there were 10 shootings in Japan that contributed to death, injury or property damage, according to the National Police Agency. Of those gun-related episodes, one person was killed and four others were injured. The figures do not include accidents or suicides.\n\nMost of the roughly 192,000 licensed firearms in the country are shotguns and hunting rifles. By comparison, in the United States, where most firearms are not registered, the number of guns in civilian hands is by some estimates close to 400 million.\n\nPolitical assassinations were a regular feature of Japan’s turbulent politics in the years leading up to World War II. But since then, only a handful of politicians have been murdered — and most without the use of guns.\n\nThe last killing of a national-level political figure was in 1960, when a 17-year-old extreme nationalist stabbed to death the leader of Japan’s Socialist Party, Inejiro Asanuma.\n\nImage The last assassination of a national political figure in Japan: A 17-year-old used a sword to kill Inejiro Asanuma, leader of the Socialist Party, on a Tokyo stage in 1960.

Yasushi Nagao/The Mainichi Shimbun/Bettmann/Corbis via Getty Images\n\nThat same year, another ultranationalist attacked Mr. Abe’s grandfather, Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi, stabbing him repeatedly in the leg and sending him to the hospital.\n\nIn recent decades, what little political violence Japan has seen has often been linked to organized crime or to right-wing groups. In 2007, Kazunaga Ito, the mayor of Nagasaki, was shot to death by a gang member.\n\nJournalists have also occasionally been targets. In 1987, a reporter for the left-leaning Asahi Shimbun was murdered, in an incident linked to right-wing anti-Korean groups.\n\nProtesters have sometimes expressed their grievances by taking their own lives, hoping to draw public sympathy to their causes. Most famously, the novelist Yukio Mishima killed himself by disembowelment in 1970, after leading a small group of right-wing militants in a failed coup.\n\nGerald L. Curtis, a professor emeritus of political science and expert in Japanese politics at Columbia University, said that the deadly attack on Mr. Abe would reverberate through Japan’s politics.\n\n“It no doubt will shake up the Japanese terribly and will reinforce the view that Japan is no longer the safe, peaceful country it has been since the end of World War II and has to change to deal with the new frightening realities it faces,” he said in an email.\n\n“The question is how Japan’s political leaders respond.”\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nVideos of the assassination circulated on social media.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

One of the officers involved, Derek Chauvin, has been arrested and charged with second-degree murder. The other three officers have been charged with aiding and abetting murder. The Times analyzed bystander videos, security camera footage and police scanner audio, spoke to witnesses and experts, and reviewed documents released by the authorities to build as comprehensive a picture as possible and better understand how George Floyd died in police custody. The events of May 25 begin here. Floyd is sitting in the driver’s seat of this blue S.U.V. Across the street is a convenience store called Cup Foods. Footage from this restaurant security camera helps us understand what happens next. Note that the timestamp on the camera is 24 minutes fast. At 7:57 p.m., two employees from Cup Foods confront Floyd and his companions about an alleged counterfeit bill he just used in their store to buy cigarettes. They demand the cigarettes back but walk away empty-handed. Four minutes later, they call the police. According to the 911 transcript, an employee says that Floyd used fake bills to buy cigarettes, and that he is “awfully drunk” and “not in control of himself.” Soon, the first police vehicle arrives on the scene. Officers Thomas Lane and J. Alexander Kueng step out of the car and approach the blue S.U.V. Seconds later, Lane pulls his gun. We don’t know exactly why. He orders Floyd to put his hands on the wheel. Lane reholsters the gun, and after about 90 seconds of back and forth, yanks Floyd out of the S.U.V. A man is filming the confrontation from a car parked behind them. The officers cuff Floyd’s hands behind his back. And Kueng walks him to the restaurant wall. “All right, what’s your name?” From the 911 transcript and the footage, we now know three important facts: First, that the police believed they were responding to a man who was drunk and out of control. But second, even though the police were expecting this situation, we can see that Floyd has not acted violently. And third, that he seems to already be in distress. Six minutes into the arrest, the two officers move Floyd back to their vehicle. As the officers approach their car, we can see Floyd fall to the ground. According to the criminal complaints filed against the officers, Floyd says he is claustrophobic and refuses to enter the police car. During the struggle, Floyd appears to turn his head to address the officers multiple times. According to the complaints, he tells them he can’t breathe. Nine minutes into the arrest, the third and final police car arrives on the scene. It’s carrying officers Tou Thao and Derek Chauvin. Both have previous records of complaints brought against them. Thao was once sued for throwing a man to the ground and hitting him. Chauvin has been involved in three police shootings, one of them fatal. Chauvin becomes involved in the struggle to get Floyd into the car. Security camera footage from Cup Foods shows Kueng struggling with Floyd in the backseat while Thao watches. Chauvin pulls him through the back seat and onto the street. We don’t know why. Floyd is now lying on the pavement, face down. That’s when two witnesses begin filming, almost simultaneously. The footage from the first witness shows us that all four officers are now gathered around Floyd. It’s the first moment when we can clearly see that Floyd is face down on the ground, with three officers applying pressure to his neck, torso and legs. At 8:20 p.m., we hear Floyd’s voice for the first time. The video stops when Lane appears to tell the person filming to walk away. “Get off to the sidewalk, please. One side or the other, please.” The officers radio a Code 2, a call for non-emergency medical assistance, reporting an injury to Floyd’s mouth. In the background, we can hear Floyd struggling. The call is quickly upgraded to a Code 3, a call for emergency medical assistance. By now another bystander, 17-year-old Darnella Frazier, is filming from a different angle. Her footage shows that despite calls for medical help, Chauvin keeps Floyd pinned down for another seven minutes. We can’t see whether Kueng and Lane are still applying pressure. Floyd: [gasping] Officer: “What do you want?” Bystander: “I’ve been —” Floyd: [gasping] In the two videos, Floyd can be heard telling officers that he can’t breathe at least 16 times in less than five minutes. Bystander: “You having fun?” But Chauvin never takes his knee off of Floyd, even as his eyes close and he appears to go unconscious. Bystander: “Bro.” According to medical and policing experts, these four police officers are committing a series of actions that violate policies, and in this case, turn fatal. They’ve kept Floyd lying face down, applying pressure for at least five minutes. This combined action is likely compressing his chest and making it impossible to breathe. Chauvin is pushing his knee into Floyd’s neck, a move banned by most police departments. Minneapolis Police Department policy states an officer can only do this if someone is, quote, “actively resisting.” And even though the officers call for medical assistance, they take no action to treat Floyd on their own while waiting for the ambulance to arrive. Officer: “Get back on the sidewalk.” According to the complaints against the officers, Lane asks him twice if they should roll Floyd onto his side. Chauvin says no. Twenty minutes into the arrest, an ambulance arrives on the scene. Bystander: “Get off of his neck!” Bystander: “He’s still on him?” The E.M.T.s check Floyd’s pulse. Bystander: “Are you serious?” Chauvin keeps his knee on Floyd’s neck for almost another whole minute, even though Floyd appears completely unresponsive. He only gets off once the E.M.T.s tell him to. Chauvin kept his knee on Floyd’s neck for over eight minutes, according to our review of the video evidence. Floyd is loaded into the ambulance. The ambulance leaves the scene, possibly because a crowd is forming. But the E.M.T.s call for additional medical help from the fire department. But when the engine arrives, the officers give them, quote, “no clear info on Floyd or his whereabouts,” according to a fire department incident report. This delays their ability to help the paramedics. Meanwhile, Floyd is going into cardiac arrest. It takes the engine five minutes to reach Floyd in the ambulance. He’s pronounced dead at a nearby hospital around 9:25 p.m. Preliminary autopsies conducted by the state and Floyd’s family both ruled his death a homicide. The widely circulated arrest videos don’t paint the entire picture of what happened to George Floyd. Crowd: “Floyd! Floyd!” Additional video and audio from the body cameras of the key officers would reveal more about why the struggle began and how it escalated. The city quickly fired all four officers. And Chauvin has been charged with second degree murder. Thomas Lane, J. Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao were charged with aiding and abetting murder.

Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said Tuesday that the release of more than 1 million metric tons of wastewater — equivalent to more than 500 Olympic-size swimming pools — will take place in a safe manner.\n\n“We expect the discharge to begin on Aug. 24 if weather and sea conditions do not hinder it,” Kishida said after a cabinet meeting in Tokyo, asking the plant’s operator, Tokyo Electric Power Co., to prepare for the release.\n\nJapan said it will send treated radioactive water from Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant into the Pacific Ocean on Aug. 24, despite local and global opposition. (Video: Naomi Schanen/The Washington Post)\n\nAfter a two-year review, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) concluded last month that Japan’s plan meets international safety standards and would have “negligible” radiological impact on people and the environment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“The government is committed to taking full responsibility until the disposal of the treated water is completed, even if it takes decades to complete,” Kishida said Tuesday.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe water, filtered to remove radioactive elements and highly diluted to lower the concentration of tritium, will be released into the Pacific Ocean in a process expected to take more than 30 years. The concentration of tritium, a radioactive material that is extremely difficult to separate from water, will drop to background ocean levels after the dilution, Japanese authorities say.\n\nFor years, the contaminated water has been stored in large metal tanks near the plant, the site of one of the worst nuclear disasters in history. But Japan is running out of space to build more tanks to accommodate the contaminated groundwater and rainwater that are still exiting the site.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStarting Thursday, the treated water will be discharged at a maximum rate of 132,000 gallons a day through an underwater tunnel off the coast of Japan. External observers, including the IAEA, will monitor the release process.\n\nThe IAEA said Tuesday that it will maintain “its impartial, independent, and objective safety review during the discharge phase.” The agency, which has an office at the plant, said it will continue to assess the relevant activities and publish independent data.\n\nDespite such assurances, environmental groups have questioned the safety of releasing the contaminated water and urged Tokyo to drop the plan.\n\n“Instead of engaging in an honest debate about this reality, the Japanese government has opted for a false solution — decades of deliberate radioactive pollution of the marine environment — during a time when the world’s oceans are already facing immense stress and pressures,” said Shaun Burnie, senior nuclear specialist at Greenpeace East Asia.\n\nThe pending discharge has been highly politicized by neighboring countries. China has been adamantly opposed to the release, which comes at a time of heightened geopolitical tensions between Tokyo and Beijing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“China has pointed out on many occasions that ocean discharge is not the safest or most prudent option to dispose of the nuclear-contaminated water. Japan simply chose it to lower economic costs,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said Monday. “This will pose unnecessary risks to neighboring countries and the rest of the world,” he said, urging Japan to call off the plan.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe plan has also ignited debates in South Korea, which has banned seafood imports from the Fukushima area, even though South Korea’s own assessment of the water-release plan also found it meets international standards.\n\nA senior South Korean government official said Tuesday that Seoul does not necessarily support Japan’s wastewater plan but sees “no scientific or technical problems.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“If the actual discharge deviates from the plan, even just a little bit, we will deem it a threat to the safety and health of our people, and immediately ask Japan to stop,” said Park Gu-yeon, vice minister of government policy coordination.\n\nBut opposition politicians have raised concerns that South Korean waters may be affected by the release, accusing President Yoon Suk Yeol of overlooking the health risks to mend diplomatic ties with Tokyo.\n\n“The Yoon Suk Yeol administration is turning a blind eye to Japan’s dumping of nuclear-contaminated water into the sea,” said Kang Sun-woo, a spokeswoman for the main opposition Democratic Party.\n\nFukushima’s fishing and agricultural industries are also worried about potential reputational harm for their products, which still carry the stigma of radioactive exposure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Our position has not changed and we continue to be opposed,” Masanobu Sakamoto, head of the National Federation of Fisheries Cooperative Associations, said Monday after meeting with Kishida.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n“Our understanding about the safety of the treated water has deepened, but scientific safety and safety from a social point is different. Once the water is released, there will be reputational damage,” he said.\n\nFishing season in Fukushima is due to start Sept. 1, and the Japanese government has pledged to monitor the water quality and collect data every day following the release.\n\nIn Tokyo, about 230 people gathered in front of the prime minister’s office Tuesday to protest the plan, holding signs and chanting slogans such as “Listen to the fishermen” and “The release will impact future generations.”\n\nAccording to a recent Kyodo News poll, 88.1 percent of respondents expressed concern that the release will hurt Japan’s image abroad. The Japanese government has said it will allocate $200 million to compensate the fishing industry for any reputational impact, and $340 million to mitigate the impact on the local economy.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nThe IAEA will maintain an on-site presence for the duration of the release.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA. TEPCO began releasing the first batch of treated radioactive water into the Pacific Ocean.\nB. The Chinese government criticized Japan’s plan to release wastewater.\nC.

It is not difficult to imagine how, once Trump is no longer President, his most fanatical supporters could apply this caveat to all levels of government, including local law enforcement. At the rally on December 12th, Nicholas Fuentes underscored the irreconcilability of a radical-right ethos and pro-police, pro-military patriotism: “When they go door to door mandating vaccines, when they go door to door taking your firearms, when they go door to door taking your children, who do you think it will be that’s going to do that? It’s going to be the police and the military.”\n\nDuring Trump’s speech on January 6th, he said, “The media is the biggest problem we have.” He went on, “It’s become the enemy of the people. . . . We gotta get them straightened out.” Several journalists were attacked during the siege. Men assaulted a Times photographer inside the Capitol, near the rotunda, as she screamed for help. After National Guard soldiers and federal agents finally arrived and expelled the Trump supporters, some members of the mob shifted their attention to television crews in a park on the east side of the building. Earlier, a man had accosted an Israeli journalist in the middle of a live broadcast, calling him a “lying Israeli” and telling him, “You are cattle today.” Now the Trump supporters surrounded teams from the Associated Press and other outlets, chasing off the reporters and smashing their equipment with bats and sticks.\n\nThere was a ritualistic atmosphere as the crowd stood in a circle around the piled-up cameras, lights, and tripods. “This is the old media,” a man said, through a megaphone. “This is what it looks like. Turn off Fox, turn off CNN.”\n\nOutside the Capitol, rioters surrounded news crews, chasing off the reporters and smashing their equipment with bats. Photograph by Balazs Gardi for The New Yorker\n\nAnother man, in a black leather jacket and wraparound sunglasses, suggested that journalists should be killed: “Start makin’ a list! Put all those names down, and we start huntin’ them down, one by one!”\n\n“Traitors to the guillotine!”\n\n“They won’t be able to walk down the streets!”\n\nThe radicalization of the Republican Party has altered the world of conservative media, which is, in turn, accelerating that radicalization. On November 7th, Fox News, which has often seemed to function as a civilian branch of the Trump Administration, called the race for Biden, along with every other major network. Furious, Trump encouraged his supporters to instead watch Newsmax, whose ratings skyrocketed as a result. Newsmax hosts have dismissed covid-19 as a “scamdemic” and have speculated that Republican politicians were being infected with the virus as a form of “sabotage.” The Newsmax headliner Michelle Malkin has praised Fuentes as one of the “New Right leaders” and the groypers as “patriotic.”\n\nAt the December 12th rally, I ran into the Pennsylvania Three Percent member whom I’d met in Harrisburg on November 7th. Then he had been a Fox News devotee, but since Election Day he’d discovered Newsmax. “I’d had no idea what it even was,” he told me. “Now the only thing that anyone I know watches anymore is Newsmax. They ask the hard questions.”\n\nIt seems unlikely that what happened on January 6th will turn anyone who inhabits such an ecosystem against Trump. On the contrary, there are already indications that the mayhem at the Capitol will further isolate and galvanize many right-wingers. The morning after the siege, an alternative narrative, pushed by Jones and other conspiracists, went viral on Parler: the assault on the Capitol had actually been instigated by Antifa agitators impersonating Trump supporters. Mo Brooks, an Alabama congressman who led the House effort to contest the certification of the Electoral College votes, tweeted, “Evidence growing that fascist ANTIFA orchestrated Capitol attack with clever mob control tactics.” (Brooks had warmed up the crowd for Trump on January 6th, with a speech whose bellicosity far surpassed the President’s. “Today is the day American patriots start takin’ down names and kickin’ ass!” he’d hollered.) Most of the “evidence” of Antifa involvement seems to be photographs of rioters clad in black. Never mind that, in early January, Tarrio, the Proud Boys chairman, wrote on Parler, “We might dress in all BLACK for the occasion.” Or that his colleague Joe Biggs, addressing antifascist activists, added, “We are going to smell like you, move like you, and look like you.”\n\nNot long after the Brooks tweet, I got a call from a woman I’d met at previous Stop the Steal rallies. She had been unable to come to D.C., owing to a recent surgery. She asked if I could tell her what I’d seen, and if the stories about Antifa were accurate. She was upset—she did not believe that “Trump people” could have done what the media were alleging. Before I responded, she put me on speakerphone. I could hear other people in the room. We spoke for a while, and it was plain that they desperately wanted to know the truth. I did my best to convey it to them as I understood it.\n\nLess than an hour after we got off the phone, the woman texted me a screenshot of a CNN broadcast with a news bulletin that read, “antifa has taken responsiblitly for storming capital hill.” The image, which had been circulating on social media, was crudely Photoshopped (and poorly spelled). “Thought you might want to see this,” she wrote.\n\nIn the year 2088, a five-hundred-pound time capsule is scheduled to be exhumed from beneath the stone slabs of Freedom Plaza. Inside an aluminum cylinder, historians will find relics honoring the legacy of Martin Luther King, Jr.: a Bible, clerical robes, a cassette tape with King’s “I Have a Dream” speech, part of which he wrote in a nearby hotel. What will those historians know about the lasting consequences of the 2020 Presidential election, which culminated with the incumbent candidate inciting his supporters to storm the Capitol and threaten to lynch his adversaries? Will this year’s campaign against the democratic process have evolved into a durable insurgency? Something worse?\n\nOn January 8th, Trump was permanently banned from Twitter. Five days later, he became the only U.S. President in history to be impeached twice. (During the Capitol siege, the man in the hard hat withdrew from one of the Senate desks a manual, from a year ago, titled “PROCEEDINGS OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE IN THE IMPEACHMENT TRIAL OF PRESIDENT DONALD JOHN TRUMP.”) Although the President has finally agreed to submit to a peaceful transition of power, he has admitted no responsibility for the deadly riot. “People thought that what I said was totally appropriate,” he told reporters on January 12th.\n\nHe will not disappear. Neither will the baleful forces that he has conjured and awakened. This is why iconoclasts like Fuentes and Jones have often seemed more exultant than angry since Election Day. For them, the disappointment of Trump’s defeat has been eclipsed by the prospect of upheaval that it has brought about. As Fuentes said on the “InfoWars” panel, “This is the best thing that can happen, because it’s destroying the legitimacy of the system.” Fuentes was at the Capitol riot, though he denies going inside. On his show the next day, he called the siege “the most awe-inspiring and inspirational and incredible thing I have seen in my entire life.”\n\nAt the heap of wrecked camera gear outside the Capitol, the man in the leather jacket and sunglasses declared to the crowd, “We are at war. . . . Mobilize in your own cities, your own counties. Storm your own capitol buildings. And take down every one of these corrupt motherfuckers.” Behind him, lights glowed in the rotunda. The sky darkened. At 8 p.m., Congress reconvened and resumed certifying the election. For six hours, Americans had held democracy hostage in the name of patriotism.\n\nThe storm might be here. ♦\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nTrump was impeached for a second time on January 13th.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Those poor people, all at similar ages to my grandchildren, they died anyway,” said Jung Si-hoon, a retiree and a church elder, who placed an old wooden cross at the makeshift altar.\n\n“What more should we say? We should pray for them and wish they rest in peace.”\n\nShops and cafés nearby were closed, and police cordoned off the site of the tragedy as they continued their investigations.\n\nSchools, kindergartens and companies around the country scrapped planned Halloween events. K-pop concerts and government briefings were also cancelled.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“The government will undertake a thorough investigation into what caused this accident and do its best to make necessary institutional changes so that such an accident is not repeated,” Prime Minister Han said as government officials met on the disaster.\n\n“Identification has been completed for all of the 154 deceased except one, and I believe it is time for follow-up measures such as funeral procedures to be carried out in earnest,” Han said. “We will do our best to provide necessary support by reflecting the opinions of the bereaved families as much as possible.”\n\nPresident Yoon Suk-yeol, who has declared a period of national mourning and designated Itaewon a disaster zone, visited a memorial altar outside the Seoul city hall with his wife on Monday to pay his respects to those who died. Former United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon was also among those expressing their condolences.\n\nThe crush of partygoers came as Itaewon, a symbol of freewheeling nightlife in the South Korean capital for decades, was beginning to recover from prolonged pandemic restrictions with new restaurants and shops opening.\n\nThe disaster is the worst in South Korea since the Sewol ferry sank in 2014, killing 304 people, most of them high school students.\n\nThe sinking of the Sewol and criticism of the official response sent shockwaves across South Korea, prompting widespread soul-searching over safety measures that are likely to be renewed in the wake of Saturday’s crush.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nLocal governments established public mourning sites.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Many more casualties are likely due to the collapse of housing and other facilities, according to local residents.\n\nThe earthquake took place at 2:20 pm (Beijing time), according to the China Earthquake Networks Center. The epicenter was monitored at 21.85 degrees north latitude and 95.95 degrees east longitude. The quake struck at a depth of 30 kilometers. The CENC said in a social media post that this was the strongest earthquake recorded so far this year.\n\nA magnitude-6.4 aftershock occurred just 12 minutes later.\n\nMyanmar's National Disaster Management Committee declared a state of emergency in six quake-affected areas and states, including Nay Pyi Daw, Sagaing region, Mandalay region, Magway region, northeast Shan state and Bago region, according to The Global New Light of Myanmar.\n\nStriking about 20 kilometers northeast of Mandalay, the second-largest city in Myanmar, the quake caused the collapse of the 90-year-old Old Sagaing Bridge, and several buildings in Mandalay and Nay Pyi Daw. Some sections of the expressway linking Mandalay and Yangon were also damaged, causing road closures along the route.\n\nThe strong earthquake also prompted the closure of Mandalay and Nay Pyi Daw airports, according to a statement by Myanmar Airways International on social media.\n\nPeople who got hurt during the earthquake were seen in crowds outside the emergency department at a major hospital in Nay Pyi Daw, according to AFP.\n\nA government spokesperson urged the international community to give humanitarian aid as soon as possible. The Myanmar Red Cross Society said it had begun to provide first-aid and other emergency response in earthquake-hit areas.\n\n\"This is the strongest earthquake I have ever experienced in my life,\" said Win Zaw Htay, a staff member of The Global New Light of Myanmar in Yangon, adding \"I tried to call some friends in Mandalay, but the line was busy so I could not reach them.\"\n\n\"The government is doing whatever possible (to help),\" said Aye Chan, chief editor of Myanmar Insider magazine, who believes the humanitarian organizations will help in their private capacity.\n\nThe Chinese embassy in Myanmar said in a statement that Chinese nationals in Myanmar should remain on guard against earthquakes and secondary disasters. The embassy urged Chinese nationals to stay updated on earthquake and disaster prevention information and follow the arrangements and guidance of the local governments to relocate to safe areas.\n\nNeighboring Thailand declared a state of emergency in Bangkok.\n\nAnd two people were reported injured in Southwest China's Yunnan province.\n\nXinhua News Agency and Mekong News Network contributed to this story.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nIndia sent approximately 15 tonnes of relief material to Myanmar via an IAF C-130J aircraft.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Instead, he said, the company plans to focus on what Zuckerberg described as the next wave of computing: a virtual universe where people will roam freely as avatars, attending virtual business meetings, shopping in virtual stores and socializing at virtual get-togethers.\n\n“From now on, we’re going to be the metaverse first. Not Facebook first,” Zuckerberg said at Connect, the company’s annual event focused on virtual and augmented reality. “Facebook is one of the most-used products in the world. But increasingly, it doesn’t encompass everything that we do. Right now, our brand is so tightly linked to one product that it can’t possibly represent everything we are doing.”\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg revealed the change at the company's annual Connect event on Oct. 28. Facebook's social media platform will keep its current name. (Video: Facebook)\n\nThe move comes as Facebook is mired in controversy over allegations that it has privately and meticulously tracked real-world harms exacerbated by its platforms, ignored warnings from its employees about the risks of their design decisions and exposed vulnerable communities around the world to a cocktail of dangerous content. After a whistleblower this month turned over tens of thousands of internal company documents to Congress and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, lawmakers and critics have called for urgent action to rein in the tech giant.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe revelations by whistleblower Frances Haugen represent arguably the most profound challenge yet to Zuckerberg and his company, which ranks as the largest social media platform in the world. Critics swiftly criticized the move, comparing it to the crisis strategy employed by tobacco company Phillip Morris when it became clear that the company had long known that cigarettes damage human health.\n\n“Don’t forget that when Phillip Morris changed [its] name to Altria it was still selling cigarettes that caused cancer,” tweeted Democratic lawyer Marc Elias.\n\nZuckerberg said the rebrand would heed the “lessons” of the past, noting in a blog post that privacy and safety would be built into the new generation of products “from Day One” — a clear nod to Facebook’s record of eroding trust. In his keynote address, he also nodded to Facebook’s problems, saying, “The last few years have been humbling for me and my company in a lot of ways.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Facebook’s trust deficit is real. The crisis brought on by the Facebook Papers, which were provided to Congress and the Securities and Exchange Commission in response to a whistleblower lawsuit, follows other scandals in recent years, such as Russian disinformation surrounding the 2016 presidential election and the Cambridge Analytica crisis that highlighted the improper sharing of personal data.\n\nThe current crisis is more existential for the company, because the harm comes from within rather than from an outsider abusing the service. The Facebook Papers also touch every aspect of the service, exposing fundamental flaws in the architecture of its algorithms, the design of the platform, and its policies, while the harms exposed around mental health and polarization hit close to home for many Americans.\n\nThe Facebook Papers were obtained by a consortium of news organizations, including The Washington Post. Facebook has called them a “coordinated effort to selectively use leaked documents to paint a false picture of our company.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the major allegations of the Facebook Papers is that the company built and deployed social media technology without having a grasp of its harmful effects. Critics fear the same problems would plague the metaverse — only the stakes could be higher, as Zuckerberg pitched that people would essentially live part of their lives in his virtual world.\n\nHe sought to offset potential criticism by saying in his presentation that the next generation of Internet services would be built with greater “humility and openness,” and take the “lessons” of the past into account. But critics and some former insiders questioned that commitment.\n\n“I was thinking during the keynote, who will be the cops in the metaverse?” said Katie Harbath, founder and CEO of consultancy Anchor Change and former Facebook public policy director. “The first few years may seem great because not that many people are on the service, but the more that come on, the more bad actors. And then the company plays catch-up.”\n\nHarbath noted that roughly every five years, the company has announced a big directional change amid a bad press cycle. In 2012, the company pivoted to mobile while getting attacked for a poor performance during its public offering. In 2017, it announced a shift to focus on communities and groups — bringing the world together — after the controversies over Russian disinformation during the previous year’s presidential election.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor the time being, Facebook’s name change seems aspirational. A company that Zuckerberg launched from a college dorm room 17 years ago has become a conglomerate encompassing WhatsApp, Instagram, Messenger and a nascent payments and hardware business, leading some experts and insiders to say that the company was long overdue for a name change.\n\nBut virtually all of Facebook’s revenue — $29 billion in the third quarter — comes from online advertising produced by the core blue Facebook app, meaning that any transition to virtual reality focused on the sale of hardware would take enormous investment and many years.\n\n“While the name change indicates a larger vision, that transformation is not yet a reality and will be a years-long investment,” eMarketer analyst Audrey Schomer said in an email.\n\nZuckerberg and Facebook have acknowledged that. Zuckerberg said in his keynote that the process to become a metaverse company would take a “decade” and that his goal was for it to “reach a billion people” over that time. On Monday, the company said its investments in the metaverse — which include a commitment to hiring 10,000 new people in hardware jobs — will shave $10 billion off its 2021 profits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nZuckerberg’s keynote was filled with a dizzying array of scenes that showcased the company’s vision for the metaverse. It included Zuckerberg doing his favorite water sport, hydrofoiling, with friends in a virtual environment, and then jumping into work meetings from a virtual home office, boxing with virtual avatars and working out on a virtual lily pad.\n\nIn a letter on the company’s website posted shortly after the keynote, Zuckerberg said that the future would be “an embodied internet where you’re in the experience, not just looking at it. We call this the metaverse, and it will touch every product we build.”\n\nZuckerberg began talking about how the company would transition to a new identity this summer. He subsequently announced a smart-glasses partnership with Ray-Ban and a plan to use its virtual reality headsets for work-related videoconferencing. He promoted a longtime friend who heads the hardware division, Andrew Bosworth, to become the company’s new chief technology officer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe political dimension of the rebrand also began months before Haugen emerged with the Facebook Papers. Facebook executives spent parts of the summer introducing the metaverse idea to experts in Washington think tanks and planning outreach to federal agencies that might regulate its hardware, The Post previously reported. Zuckerberg has told colleagues that he no longer wants to be the face of the company’s headaches in Washington and elsewhere.\n\nThe term “metaverse” comes from science fiction and has been popularized by venture capitalists in recent years as a way to talk about interconnected services.\n\nFacebook also isn’t the first Silicon Valley company to rebrand itself. Google changed its parent company’s name to Alphabet in 2015 in an attempt to unify a corporate behemoth that encompassed not only search-and-display advertising but also driverless cars and a life-sciences division. Snapchat changed its name to Snap Inc. in an attempt to rebrand itself as a camera company.\n\nZuckerberg said that the name “meta” was inspired by his love of the classics, and that it comes from the Greek word “beyond.”\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nFacebook changed its corporate name to Meta on October 28 at the company's annual Connect event.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Mongabay had exclusive access to the report ahead of release.\n\nAt least 125,000 hectares (310,000 acres) of the Brazilian Amazon — the equivalent to 172,000 soccer fields — were cleared through 2019 and then burned in August. The findings offer a base map overlapping 2019 deforestation and fire hotspots, and include 16 high-resolution time lapse videos unveiling newly cleared agricultural lands linked to fire occurrences.\n\nMAAP’s findings show that the dramatic photos that garnered worldwide attention of smoky fires sweeping the Brazilian Amazon in August do not correspond with burning rainforest, but instead coincide with areas intentionally deforested this year, with the cleared land then set ablaze to finish the agricultural conversion process.\n\nAlthough the report didn’t detect major forest fires in Brazil to date, the risk still exists, as the dry season deepens, given that many fire occurrences were detected on agriculture-forest boundaries. The study doesn’t say how much of the 125,000 hectares cleared in the first 8 months of 2019 were illegally deforested. See All Key Ideas\n\nThe dramatic photos of smoky fires sweeping through the Brazilian Amazon that garnered worldwide attention in August do not correspond to burning rainforest, but instead mostly correlate to land that was deforested earlier in 2019 and was then set ablaze in August to complete the land’s conversion for agricultural use, according to a report released today by the Monitoring of the Andean Amazon Project (MAAP). Mongabay had exclusive access to the report ahead of its release.\n\nAt least 125,000 hectares (310,000 acres) — the equivalent to 172,000 soccer fields — were cleared of forest earlier in 2019, and then burned in August, the report showed. The majority of the occurrences were observed in the northern state of Amazonas, which accounted alone for 39,100 hectares (96,618 acres), or about 30 percent of the total cleared-and-burned areas. Major deforested-and-burned lands were also detected in the northern states of Rondônia and Pará, where fire hotspots were also prominent in August.\n\nThe findings offer the first known base map linking 2019 deforestation and fire hotspots, and were presented with supporting evidence utilizing 16 high-resolution time lapse videos unveiling the process of forest clearing and overlapping fire occurrences in the northern Amazon region.\n\nBase map showing overlapping 2019 deforestation and fire hotspots in Brazil.

Source: MAAP\n\nThe base map included two key data layers: 2019 forest loss alerts from GLAD, the Global Land Analysis & Discovery lab at the University of Maryland, and 2019 fire alerts from NASA, revealing the critical overlap between deforestation and the blazes. MAAP researchers then zoomed in on select areas by analyzing high-resolution satellite imagery from Planet and the European Space Agency (Sentinel-2), and created striking time lapse videos using Planet’s website.\n\nTime lapse video above shows deforestation followed by fire in the Brazilian state of Rondônia, in the Amazon region.

Data: Planet, ESA.\n\n“The major issue is deforestation… Now it makes sense why the fires were so smoky… It looks like a forest fire, it’s smoky as a forest fire [would be], but it’s burning recent deforested areas… The whole key was to look at the archive satellite imagery through 2019. We got much more information than a simple photo,” said Matt Finer, senior research specialist and director of MAAP, an initiative of Amazon Conservation, Conservación Amazónica (ACCA).\n\n“We are not minimizing the importance of the fires, but our findings are showing that deforestation is also the critical issue,” Finer told Mongabay. “The world needs to be as upset and alert to deforestation as they were to fires, because the deforestation is how this whole system, this whole process is starting… We need the same attention and awareness that there was with the fires in terms of deforestation because both go together.”\n\nTime lapse video above shows deforestation followed by fire in the Brazilian state of Amazonas, in the Amazon region. Data: Planet, ESA.\n\nIn August, tens of thousands of active fires ravaged the Amazon region and triggered an international outcry, with protesters in Brazil and around the world demanding effective action from President Jair Bolsonaro to curb the blazes. The Amazon fires came into the spotlight after São Paulo’s skies suddenly turned black with smoke on August 19, prompting an outpouring of concern across social media worldwide under the #PrayforAmazonas hashtag, which reached more than 300,000 tweets in just two days.\n\nBolsonaro immediately reacted, suggesting, without any proof, that NGOs could be behind the fires as a retaliation against the government because of the suspension of a $33.2 million payment from Norway to the Amazon Fund.\n\nExperts promptly highlighted the link between deforestation and the fires, given the lack of severe drought this year. According to their analysis, the forest-to-pasture conversion strategy of ranchers in the Brazilian Amazon is to cut rainforest trees, allow the wood to dry, then set it ablaze to fully clear the land and produce ashes to fertilize the soil to grow grass for grazing — a process apparently given scientific weight by the MAAP findings.\n\nThe new findings also seem to support accusations by Bolsonaro critics, that his inflammatory rhetoric during and after the 2018 election, emboldened ranchers to begin clearing Amazon forest once the new president took office in January 2019.\n\nIn fact, Brazilian authorities are currently investigating a group of some 70 farmers and land grabbers in Pará state who allegedly organized a “Day of Fire” on August 10 in support of Bolsonaro and his measures easing environmental enforcement in the country, Globo Rural magazine reported.\n\nIncreasing risk\n\nAlthough MAAP’s analysis didn’t detect major forest fires in Brazil to date, the risk still exists as the dry season deepens, given that many fire occurrences were detected on agriculture-forest boundaries, Finer explained.\n\n“The fires… hit the forest line and [seemed] to go out, but [they’re] still impacting the edge of the forest… And these fires burning recently cleared areas can very easily become forest fires. We haven’t seen this yet this year in the moist forest in Brazil, but as the dry season continues, or if there is a [worsening] drought year, then this process of burning recent deforested land will get much, much worse and we could see major forest fires,” he warned.\n\nSo far, MAAP has detected major fires hitting native vegetation only in drier ecosystems, including the dry forest of Bolivia and Brazil’s Cerrado savanna.\n\nThe report also includes high-resolution time lapse videos of fires within the Kayapó and Munduruku indigenous territories, where Finer assumes they were set to regenerate grass for cattle pasture. The area burned within the two indigenous reserves totaled 24,000 hectares (60,000 acres) and 700 hectares (1,700 acres), respectively. The report also detected recent fire on ridges within the Kayapó territory, in northern Roraima state, that have burned some 930 hectares (2,300 acres).\n\nTime lapse video above shows savanna fire within the Kayapó indigenous territory. Data: Planet, ESA.\n\n“When we look at the dry forest in Bolivia, there we did see what everyone had in mind: fires that were out of control, burning natural ecosystems. But in Brazil every time we zoomed in on a fire, we saw the fire burning an already cleared deforestation area. We just never saw a fire, out of control fires, sweeping through the rainforest [in August],” Finer explained.\n\nIn the preliminary version of the report — also obtained exclusively by Mongabay ahead of its release on September 11 — the area cleared and then burned totaled 52,500 hectares (equivalent to 72,000 soccer fields).\n\nBack in March, MAAP did detect major forest fires in northern Roraima state, including fires near the Yanomami indigenous territory. Between January and August, fire hotspots in indigenous territories rose 88 percent compared to the same period of 2018, according to the Catholic Church’s Indigenous Council (CIMI), citing data from Brazil’s National Institute of Space Research (INPE).\n\n“The global storyline [has been that] the Amazon rainforest is burning; there are fires ravaging the Amazon rainforest,” Finer concluded. But, it’s critical the world “understand the importance of deforestation in this process. The major scenario that we’re seeing is major deforestation followed by the fire. That’s the message that the public needs to understand: there are two issues together — deforestation and fires, not just fires. And to prevent the fires we need to prevent deforestation.”\n\nUpdate (September 24, 2019): This article was updated to include MAAP’s latest figures.\n\nBanner image caption: Planet image of fires in the Amazon on August 16, 2019 in Pará state, processed by the Center for Global Discovery and Conservation Science and Planet at ASU.\n\nFEEDBACK: Use this form to send a message to the author of this post.

But the grid, ERCOT tells Local Profile, is anticipated to hold.\n\nWhat To Expect\n\nVitruvian Park: Jan. 2024 | Photo: Matilda Preisendorf\n\nFrom late Wednesday through Friday morning, widespread snow is expected, with 1-4 inches likely, and up to 6 inches possible in certain areas of Collin County. National Weather Service (NWS) Meteorologist Matt Stalley told Local Profile the NWS is still trying to pinpoint which areas will see the most snowfall, as it is still “up in the air.” (Literally, it seems!)\n\nStarting Jan. 6, 2025, gusty northwest winds combined with falling temperatures will cause wind chills to drop into the single digits and teens. From Jan. 7-12, wind chills in the teens are expected. There is also high confidence that travel will be impacted due to wintry precipitation from Wednesday through Friday\n\nWeather Watch\n\nPhoto: ERCOT\n\n​The ERCOT Weather Watch serves as an early alert for forecasted severe weather, which may lead to higher electrical demand and the possibility of lower reserves. Reducing electric use during peak demand times can help lower demand on the grid.\n\nWhy ERCOT Says Grid Conditions Will Hold\n\nDespite the potential for severe weather, ERCOT remains confident that Texans will not be affected by power outages or other issues. “ERCOT is closely monitoring the winter weather conditions,” ERCOT Communications Christy Penders told Local Profile. “Grid conditions are expected to be normal.”\n\n\n\nERCOT said in an official statement that it will utilize all available resources to manage the grid, maintaining a reliability-focused approach to operations. In 2021, the Texas Legislature enacted new weatherization standards for power plants and transmission lines, mandating that power plants insulate their facilities to better withstand winter storms. Since the changes were made, ERCOT has passed generation and transmission facilities inspections 2,892 times.\n\n\n\nSince the major power outages in 2021, which led to over 200 deaths, ERCOT says it has made several changes to the Texas power grid since the 2021 winter storm and does not expect to see a repeat anytime soon. As Local Profile previously reported, post-storm assessments conducted by experts estimated the overall financial impact to range between $80 billion and $130 billion, encompassing physical damages and missed economic prospects.\n\nHow To Monitor Grid Conditions\n\nERCOT encourages Texans to sign up for grid condition notifications through the Texas Advisory and Notification System. Texans can also monitor real-time and extended grid conditions at ercot.com.\n\nHow To Prepare Before Storms\n\nWhile we pull out those winter coats, we have to make sure our homes are taken care of as well. Pipes freezing are the number one concern during the colder months, and if they are not properly prepared, damage is likely. But, there are other parts of the home that need protected as well.

(Anne Gieske, a nursing student at the University of Kentucky studying in Seoul this semester, also died, the school said in a statement on Sunday.)\n\n“It was like it stabbed like a hundred million times simultaneously,” Mr. Blesi said, speaking by phone on Sunday as he drove to pick up his older son, Joey Blesi, from college in Alabama. “It was like your world just collapsing. It was numb and devastating all at the same time.”\n\nImage Steven Blesi, left, and his brother, Joey Blesi. They were best friends, their father said.\n\nAs he made the two-hour drive, Mr. Blesi said he could not stop worrying about Joey. Steven was the more outgoing sibling, he said. Joey was shyer, more introverted.\n\n“Steven and him were best friends,” Mr. Blesi said, “I’m just worried to death about him, about how he becomes a whole heart instead of half a heart.”\n\nSteven Blesi had been waiting for years for an opportunity to study abroad, his father said. He had a passion for international business, specifically in East Asia, but the coronavirus pandemic had kept him from traveling there until this fall.\n\n“My wife is Latin, but he did not want to go to Latin America,” Mr. Blesi said, chuckling. “He was actually learning Korean in addition to Spanish. He wanted to speak more languages than my wife.” On Saturday, initial reports suggested that around 20 foreign nationals had been killed but that none of them were from the United States.\n\n“That gave us hope,” Mr. Blesi said.\n\nHe and his wife remained positive even after he tried calling his son repeatedly and someone else — a police officer — finally answered. Steven Blesi’s phone was among the scores of phones littered across the scene of the deadly crowd surge.\n\n“Well, maybe his phone got knocked out of his hand,” Mr. Blesi recalled thinking. “Maybe he lost his phone.”\n\nMr. Blesi was eventually able to piece together what happened to his son after getting in touch with some of his friends in Seoul. He had just finished taking midterm exams, and he and a group of friends were going out Saturday for a night of fun. They eventually found themselves at the Halloween celebration. A few of Steven Blesi’s friends left the gathering to escape the crowds, but he stayed behind.\n\n“I texted him maybe a half-hour before all this happened, and I said: ‘I know you’re out and about. Be safe,’” Mr. Blesi said. “I never got a reply to that.”\n\nBeyond the grief, Mr. Blesi said that he felt rage toward the authorities who he believes allowed this to happen.\n\nThey should not allow crowds to get that big, he said. “I see politicians out there grieving on Twitter,” he said. “It’s just, to me, publicity on their end. Whereas they should be working to try to ensure rules are in place to not allow this type of crowding to ever happen again.”\n\nMr. Blesi and others who knew his son agreed that his defining feature was the compassion he had for others, especially people who were struggling. He was never afraid to stand up for someone in need, Mr. Blesi said. He loved traveling and basketball, and he and his older brother were both Eagle Scouts.\n\n“He was an adventurous spirit and a loving spirit,” Mr. Blesi said. “That’s the only way I know how to describe him. And the loss is just unbearable.”\n\nAfter he posted the confirmation of his son’s death on Twitter, the responses kept coming.\n\n“May he rest in fun-filled, painless places,” one person said.\n\n“Heartbroken,” said another.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nPresident Yoon Suk-yeol declared a period of national mourning and designated Itaewon a disaster zone.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

He needs to think about the poor as well,” said Andre, a 38-year-old with no driver’s licence who nonetheless joined a blockade in Dole, eastern France.\n\nOpposition parties and labour unions have voiced support for the demonstration but most have not joined, wary of being seen alongside officials from the National Rally and other far-right groups.\n\nThe government announced last week a series of measures to quell the anger, including energy subsidies and higher scrappage bonuses towards cleaner vehicles.\n\nAnd in a TV interview this week Macron admitted that he had “not succeeded in reconciling the French with their leaders” and “we have probably not given them enough consideration.”\n\nBut he said he would not rescind the fuel tax increases, which are set to rise again in January.— AFP\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nPrime Minister Edouard Philippe announced nearly 500 million euros in aid for low-income motorists.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA. Authorities mobilized 3,000 officers and set up a security perimeter to contain 8,000 protesters and protect government buildings in Paris.\nB.

A month ago, demonstrations forced the immigration courts in both San Francisco and Concord, about 30 miles northeast, to close for nearly two days.\n\nThe new ICE approach is a significant break from past practice, when immigration officials largely steered clear of courthouse arrests out of concern that they would deter people from complying with legal orders.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nPolice attacked protesters using stun hand grenades, tear gas, rubber bullets, vehicles, and direct projectile fire.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

An uncontrolled collapse of Credit Suisse would lead to incalculable consequences for the country and the international financial system.\"\n\nCredit Suisse is designated by the Financial Stability Board, an international body that monitors the global financial system, as one of the world’s globally systemic important banks. This means regulators believe its uncontrolled failure would lead to ripples throughout the financial system not unlike the collapse of Lehman Brothers 15 years ago.\n\nMarkets remain jittery despite the best efforts of regulators to restore calm. Shares fell Monday in Asia, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng index down 2.7% and Tokyo's benchmark Nikkei 225 losing 1.2%. Bank shares in the region were lower and futures in London and Frankfurt also fell.\n\nSunday's news conference follows the collapse of two large US banks last week that spurred a frantic, broad response from the US government to prevent any further bank panics. Still, global financial markets have been on edge since Credit Suisse's share price began plummeting this week.\n\nThe 167-year-old Credit Suisse already received a $50 billion (54 million Swiss francs) loan from the Swiss National Bank, which briefly caused a rally in the bank's stock price. Yet the move did not appear to be enough to stem an outflow of deposits, according to news reports.\n\nStill, many of Credit Suisse's problems are unique and do not overlap with the weaknesses that brought down Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, whose failures led to a significant rescue effort by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Reserve. As a result, their downfall does not necessarily signal the start of a financial crisis similar to what occurred in 2008.\n\nThe deal caps a highly volatile week for Credit Suisse, most notably on Wednesday when its shares plunged to a record low after its largest investor, the Saudi National Bank, said it wouldn't invest any more money into the bank to avoid tripping regulations that would kick in if its stake rose about 10%.\n\nFollowing news of the Swiss deal, the world’s central banks announced coordinated moves to stabilize banks, including access to a lending facility for banks to borrow U.S. dollars if they need them, a practice widely used during the 2008 crisis. Three months after Lehman Brothers collapsed in September of 2008, such swap lines had been tapped for $580 billion. Swap lines also were rolled out during market turmoil in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nColm Kelleher, the UBS chairman, hailed \"enormous opportunities\" from the takeover and highlighted his bank’s \"conservative risk culture\" – a subtle swipe at Credit Suisse's reputation for more swashbuckling gambles in search of bigger returns. He said the combined group would create a wealth manager with over $5 trillion in total invested assets.\n\nOn Friday, shares dropped 8% to close at 1.86 francs ($2) on the Swiss exchange. The stock has seen a long downward slide: It traded at more than 80 francs in 2007.\n\nIts current troubles began after Credit Suisse reported on Tuesday that managers had identified \"material weaknesses\" in the bank’s internal controls on financial reporting as of the end of last year. That fanned fears that Credit Suisse would be the next domino to fall.\n\nWhile smaller than its Swiss rival UBS, Credit Suisse still wields considerable influence, with $1.4 trillion assets under management. The firm has significant trading desks around the world, caters to the rich and wealthy through its wealth management business, and is a major advisor for global companies in mergers and acquisitions. Notably, Credit Suisse did not need government assistance in 2008 during the financial crisis, while UBS did.\n\nDespite the banking turmoil, the European Central Bank on Thursday approved a large, half-percentage point increase in interest rates to try to curb stubbornly high inflation, saying Europe’s banking sector is \"resilient,\" with strong finances.\n\nECB President Christine Lagarde said the banks \"are in a completely different position from 2008\" during the financial crisis, partly because of stricter government regulation.\n\nThe Swiss bank has been pushing to raise money from investors and roll out a new strategy to overcome an array of troubles, including bad bets on hedge funds, repeated shake-ups of its top management and a spying scandal involving UBS.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nCredit Suisse's board rebuffed the proposal from UBS.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA. None of the others are correct causes.\nB. Credit Suisse announced material weaknesses in its financial reporting.\nC. Investors and depositors withdrew billions from Credit Suisse.\nD.

The man was 46-year-old George Floyd, a bouncer originally from Houston who had lost his job at a restaurant when the coronavirus pandemic hit. Crowd: “No justice, no peace.” Floyd’s death triggered major protests in Minneapolis, and sparked rage across the country. One of the officers involved, Derek Chauvin, has been arrested and charged with second-degree murder. The other three officers have been charged with aiding and abetting murder. The Times analyzed bystander videos, security camera footage and police scanner audio, spoke to witnesses and experts, and reviewed documents released by the authorities to build as comprehensive a picture as possible and better understand how George Floyd died in police custody. The events of May 25 begin here. Floyd is sitting in the driver’s seat of this blue S.U.V. Across the street is a convenience store called Cup Foods. Footage from this restaurant security camera helps us understand what happens next. Note that the timestamp on the camera is 24 minutes fast. At 7:57 p.m., two employees from Cup Foods confront Floyd and his companions about an alleged counterfeit bill he just used in their store to buy cigarettes. They demand the cigarettes back but walk away empty-handed. Four minutes later, they call the police. According to the 911 transcript, an employee says that Floyd used fake bills to buy cigarettes, and that he is “awfully drunk” and “not in control of himself.” Soon, the first police vehicle arrives on the scene. Officers Thomas Lane and J. Alexander Kueng step out of the car and approach the blue S.U.V. Seconds later, Lane pulls his gun. We don’t know exactly why. He orders Floyd to put his hands on the wheel. Lane reholsters the gun, and after about 90 seconds of back and forth, yanks Floyd out of the S.U.V. A man is filming the confrontation from a car parked behind them. The officers cuff Floyd’s hands behind his back. And Kueng walks him to the restaurant wall. “All right, what’s your name?” From the 911 transcript and the footage, we now know three important facts: First, that the police believed they were responding to a man who was drunk and out of control. But second, even though the police were expecting this situation, we can see that Floyd has not acted violently. And third, that he seems to already be in distress. Six minutes into the arrest, the two officers move Floyd back to their vehicle. As the officers approach their car, we can see Floyd fall to the ground. According to the criminal complaints filed against the officers, Floyd says he is claustrophobic and refuses to enter the police car. During the struggle, Floyd appears to turn his head to address the officers multiple times. According to the complaints, he tells them he can’t breathe. Nine minutes into the arrest, the third and final police car arrives on the scene. It’s carrying officers Tou Thao and Derek Chauvin. Both have previous records of complaints brought against them. Thao was once sued for throwing a man to the ground and hitting him. Chauvin has been involved in three police shootings, one of them fatal. Chauvin becomes involved in the struggle to get Floyd into the car. Security camera footage from Cup Foods shows Kueng struggling with Floyd in the backseat while Thao watches. Chauvin pulls him through the back seat and onto the street. We don’t know why. Floyd is now lying on the pavement, face down. That’s when two witnesses begin filming, almost simultaneously. The footage from the first witness shows us that all four officers are now gathered around Floyd. It’s the first moment when we can clearly see that Floyd is face down on the ground, with three officers applying pressure to his neck, torso and legs. At 8:20 p.m., we hear Floyd’s voice for the first time. The video stops when Lane appears to tell the person filming to walk away. “Get off to the sidewalk, please. One side or the other, please.” The officers radio a Code 2, a call for non-emergency medical assistance, reporting an injury to Floyd’s mouth. In the background, we can hear Floyd struggling. The call is quickly upgraded to a Code 3, a call for emergency medical assistance. By now another bystander, 17-year-old Darnella Frazier, is filming from a different angle. Her footage shows that despite calls for medical help, Chauvin keeps Floyd pinned down for another seven minutes. We can’t see whether Kueng and Lane are still applying pressure. Floyd: [gasping] Officer: “What do you want?” Bystander: “I’ve been —” Floyd: [gasping] In the two videos, Floyd can be heard telling officers that he can’t breathe at least 16 times in less than five minutes. Bystander: “You having fun?” But Chauvin never takes his knee off of Floyd, even as his eyes close and he appears to go unconscious. Bystander: “Bro.” According to medical and policing experts, these four police officers are committing a series of actions that violate policies, and in this case, turn fatal. They’ve kept Floyd lying face down, applying pressure for at least five minutes. This combined action is likely compressing his chest and making it impossible to breathe. Chauvin is pushing his knee into Floyd’s neck, a move banned by most police departments. Minneapolis Police Department policy states an officer can only do this if someone is, quote, “actively resisting.” And even though the officers call for medical assistance, they take no action to treat Floyd on their own while waiting for the ambulance to arrive. Officer: “Get back on the sidewalk.” According to the complaints against the officers, Lane asks him twice if they should roll Floyd onto his side. Chauvin says no. Twenty minutes into the arrest, an ambulance arrives on the scene. Bystander: “Get off of his neck!” Bystander: “He’s still on him?” The E.M.T.s check Floyd’s pulse. Bystander: “Are you serious?” Chauvin keeps his knee on Floyd’s neck for almost another whole minute, even though Floyd appears completely unresponsive. He only gets off once the E.M.T.s tell him to. Chauvin kept his knee on Floyd’s neck for over eight minutes, according to our review of the video evidence. Floyd is loaded into the ambulance. The ambulance leaves the scene, possibly because a crowd is forming. But the E.M.T.s call for additional medical help from the fire department. But when the engine arrives, the officers give them, quote, “no clear info on Floyd or his whereabouts,” according to a fire department incident report. This delays their ability to help the paramedics. Meanwhile, Floyd is going into cardiac arrest. It takes the engine five minutes to reach Floyd in the ambulance. He’s pronounced dead at a nearby hospital around 9:25 p.m. Preliminary autopsies conducted by the state and Floyd’s family both ruled his death a homicide. The widely circulated arrest videos don’t paint the entire picture of what happened to George Floyd. Crowd: “Floyd! Floyd!” Additional video and audio from the body cameras of the key officers would reveal more about why the struggle began and how it escalated. The city quickly fired all four officers. And Chauvin has been charged with second degree murder. Thomas Lane, J. Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao were charged with aiding and abetting murder.

Gen. Qassem Soleimani, killed in a drone strike early Friday, is getting the vast majority of the media attention. But several others were also killed in the attack, including militia leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis. For years, Muhandis has been one of the most important military figures in Iraq, as the deputy commander of Iraq's Popular Mobilization Forces.\n\nBorn in Iraq as Jamal Jaafar al-Ibrahimi, Muhandis fled to Iran after Saddam Hussein came to power in the late 1970s. He was among a number of Iraqis who left to fight on the side of Iran during the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s. He is considered by the U.S. and Kuwait to be the architect of the bombing of the American and French embassies in Kuwait in 1983, and was sentenced to death by a Kuwaiti court.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nMuhandis is responsible for extensive violence against American interests. In the power vacuum that developed after the death of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein in 2006, Muhandis founded Kataib Hezbollah, an anti-U.S. insurgency movement responsible for numerous American casualties. The U.S. considered Muhandis and his insurgency to be \"terrorist\" groups.\n\n\"His network was the most professional killer of Americans in Iraq,\" says Michael Knights, senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. Knights tells NPR that the vast majority of IEDs that killed hundreds of Americans in Iraq were provided by Muhandis' network. According to Knights, the U.S. considered killing Muhandis multiple times, including in June 2011, when 15 American soldiers were killed in Iraq -- the vast majority by Kataib Hezbollah.\n\nThe killing of Muhandis came after a week of violence, much of which was orchestrated by Kataib Hezbollah. On Dec. 27, the group attacked the K1 military base near the Iraqi city of Kurkuk, killing an American contractor and wounding several American and Iraqi personnel. On Tuesday, the U.S. Embassy compound in Baghdad was stormed, as a crowd of protesters set fires and militia members tried to enter the embassy. On Thursday, U.S. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper warned Iran and its \"proxy militias\" that the U.S. would retaliate.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nMuhandis developed a reputation as being able to effectively corral dozens of Iraqi militias into a relatively cohesive fighting force. The reason he could do this, Knights says, is because he had the backing of Soleimani. \"Muhandis was a politician,\" Knights says. \"He was an Eisenhower, not a Patton.\"\n\nSecurity experts are divided on whether Muhandis was specifically targeted in the drone attack. \"It's highly likely that they were targeting him,\" Anthony Cordesman, the Burke chair in strategy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, tells NPR. \"They hit two cars. As I understand it, there were more than two cars on the road. The strikes had to have a reasonable amount of precision.\"\n\nKnights says that the operation was designed to take out Soleimani, and it was a \"bonus\" that Muhandis happened to personally pick him up off the airplane. \"It really helps to have got both.\"\n\nHad only Muhandis been killed, the first Iraqi reaction would be to ask Soleimani who could replace him, Knights says. If only Soleimani had been killed, Muhandis would still be there to lead military operations. \"Getting one or the other would have left a lot of leadership structure in place. This gives the entire system a really heavy jolt.\"\n\n\"Their combined death is certainly a blow to the Iranian project in Iraq, but how much remains to be seen,\" says Thomas Joscelyn, senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. It's hard for a Western observer to know how important Muhandis was in terms of decision-making and internal dynamics within the PMF, Joscelyn tells NPR. Was he a uniquely important figure? Or just another leader whose job can be effectively performed by his successor?\n\nCordesman agrees that exactly how great an impact Muhandis' death will have is still unknown. \"We tend to demonize these people as if they were absolutely critical, stable figures, but you had a pretty competent Iranian deputy take over the al-Quds force in less than a day,\" says Cordesman, referring to Esmail Ghaani. \"The whole idea that you paralyze a movement by getting rid of the leader, if that's true we don't have any recent examples.\"\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nA U.S. drone strike killed Iranian Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani and Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis after Muhandis picked up Soleimani from an airplane.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA. President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. from the nuclear accord after taking office.\nB. During the 1980s Iran-Iraq War, Muhandis fought on the side of Iran.\nC.

One of them, a police source, said that the department had collected more than enough evidence to prosecute Weinstein. But the other said that Gutierrez’s statements about her past complicated the case for the office of the Manhattan District Attorney, Cyrus Vance, Jr. After two weeks of investigation, the D.A.’s office decided not to file charges. The office declined to comment on this story but pointed me to its statement at the time: “This case was taken seriously from the outset, with a thorough investigation conducted by our Sex Crimes Unit. After analyzing the available evidence, including multiple interviews with both parties, a criminal charge is not supported.”\n\n“We had the evidence,” the police source involved in the operation told me. “It’s a case that made me angrier than I thought possible, and I have been on the force a long time.”\n\nGutierrez, when contacted for this story, said that she was unable to discuss the incident. Someone close to the matter told me that, after the D.A.’s office decided not to press charges, Gutierrez, facing Weinstein’s legal team, and in return for a payment, signed a highly restrictive nondisclosure agreement with Weinstein, including an affidavit stating that the acts he admits to in the recording never happened.\n\nWeinstein’s use of such settlements was reported by the Times and confirmed to me by numerous people. A former employee with firsthand knowledge of two settlement negotiations that took place in London in the nineteen-nineties recalled, “It felt like David versus Goliath . . . the guy with all the money and the power flexing his muscle and quashing the allegations and getting rid of them.”\n\n6.\n\nThe Times story disclosed a complaint to the Weinstein Company’s office of human resources, filed on behalf of a temporary front-desk assistant named Emily Nestor in December, 2014. Her own account of Weinstein’s conduct is being made public here for the first time. Nestor was twenty-five when she started the job and, after finishing law school and starting business school, was considering a career in the movie industry. On her first day in the position, Nestor said, two employees told her that she was Weinstein’s “type” physically. When Weinstein arrived at the office, he made comments about her appearance, referring to her as “the pretty girl.” He asked how old she was, and then sent all of his assistants out of the room and made her write down her telephone number.\n\nWeinstein told her to meet him for drinks that night. Nestor invented an excuse. When he insisted, she suggested an early-morning coffee the next day, assuming that he wouldn’t accept. He did, and told her to meet him at the Peninsula hotel in Beverly Hills, where he was staying. Nestor said that she had talked with friends in the entertainment industry and employees in the company who had warned her about Weinstein’s reputation. “I dressed very frumpy,” she said.\n\nNestor told me that the meeting was “the most excruciating and uncomfortable hour of my life.” After Weinstein offered her career help, she said, he began to boast about his sexual liaisons with other women, including famous actresses. “He said, ‘You know, we could have a lot of fun,’ ” Nestor recalled. “ ‘I could put you in my London office, and you could work there and you could be my girlfriend.’ ” She declined. He asked to hold her hand; she said no. In Nestor’s account of the exchange, Weinstein said, “Oh, the girls always say no. You know, ‘No, no.’ And then they have a beer or two and then they’re throwing themselves at me.” In a tone that Nestor described as “very weirdly proud,” Weinstein added “that he’d never had to do anything like Bill Cosby.” She assumed that he meant he’d never drugged a woman. “It’s just a bizarre thing to be so proud of,” she said. “That you’ve never had to resort to doing that. It was just so far removed from reality and normal rules of consent.”\n\n“Textbook sexual harassment” was how Nestor described Weinstein’s behavior to me. “It’s a pretty clear case of sexual harassment when your superior, the C.E.O., asks one of their inferiors, a temp, to have sex with them, essentially in exchange for mentorship.” She recalled refusing his advances at least a dozen times. “ ‘No’ did not mean ‘no’ to him,” she said. “I was very aware of how inappropriate it was. But I felt trapped.”\n\nThroughout the breakfast, she said, Weinstein interrupted their conversation to yell into his cell phone, enraged over a spat that Amy Adams, a star in the Weinstein movie “Big Eyes,” was having in the press. Afterward, Weinstein told Nestor to keep an eye on the news cycle, which he promised would be spun in his favor. Later in the day, there were indeed negative news items about his opponents, and Weinstein stopped by Nestor’s desk to be sure that she’d seen them.\n\nBy that point, Nestor recalled, “I was very afraid of him. And I knew how well connected he was. And how if I pissed him off then I could never have a career in that industry.” Still, she told a friend about the incident, and he alerted the company’s office of human resources, which contacted her. (The friend did not respond to a request for comment.) Nestor had a conversation with company officials about the matter but didn’t pursue it further: the officials said that Weinstein would be informed of anything she told them, a practice not uncommon in businesses the size of the Weinstein Company. Several former Weinstein employees told me that the company’s human-resources department was utterly ineffective; one female executive described it as “a place where you went to when you didn’t want anything to get done. That was common knowledge across the board. Because everything funnelled back to Harvey.” She described the department’s typical response to allegations of misconduct as “This is his company. If you don’t like it, you can leave.”\n\nNestor told me that some people at the company did seem concerned. Irwin Reiter, a senior executive who had worked for Weinstein for almost three decades, sent her a series of messages via LinkedIn. “We view this very seriously and I personally am very sorry your first day was like this,” Reiter wrote. “Also if there are further unwanted advances, please let us know.” Last year, just before the Presidential election, he reached out again, writing, “All this Trump stuff made me think of you.” He described Nestor’s experience as part of Weinstein’s serial misconduct. “I’ve fought him about mistreatment of women 3 weeks before the incident with you. I even wrote him an email that got me labelled by him as sex police,” he wrote. “The fight I had with him about you was epic. I told him if you were my daughter he would have not made out so well.” (Reiter declined to comment for this article, but his lawyer, Debra Katz, confirmed the authenticity of the messages and said that Reiter had made diligent efforts to raise these issues, to no avail. Katz also noted that Reiter “is eager to coöperate fully with any outside investigation.”)\n\nThough no assault occurred, and Nestor left after completing her temporary placement, she was profoundly affected by the experience. “I was definitely traumatized for a while, in terms of feeling so harassed and frightened,” she said. “It made me feel incredibly discouraged that this could be something that happens on a regular basis. I actually decided not to go into entertainment because of this incident.”\n\n7.\n\nEmma de Caunes, a French actress, met Weinstein in 2010, at a party at the Cannes Film Festival. A few months later, he asked her to a lunch meeting at the Hôtel Ritz, in Paris. In the meeting, Weinstein told de Caunes that he was going to be producing a movie with a prominent director, that he planned to shoot it in France, and that it had a strong female role. It was an adaptation of a book, he said, but he claimed he couldn’t remember the title. “But I’ll give it to you,” Weinstein said, according to de Caunes. “I have it in my room.”\n\nDe Caunes replied that she had to leave, since she was already running late for a TV show she was hosting—Eminem was appearing on the show that afternoon, and she hadn’t written her questions yet. Weinstein pleaded with her to retrieve the book with him, and finally she agreed. As they got to his room, she received a telephone call from one of her colleagues, and Weinstein disappeared into a bathroom, leaving the door open. She assumed that he was washing his hands.\n\n“When I hung up the phone, I heard the shower go on in the bathroom,” she said. “I was, like, What the fuck, is he taking a shower?” Weinstein came out, naked and with an erection. “What are you doing?” she asked. Weinstein demanded that she lie on the bed and told her that many other women had done so before her.\n\n“I was very petrified,” de Caunes said. “But I didn’t want to show him that I was petrified, because I could feel that the more I was freaking out, the more he was excited.” She added, “It was like a hunter with a wild animal. The fear turns him on.” De Caunes told Weinstein that she was leaving, and he panicked. “We haven’t done anything!” she remembered him saying. “It’s like being in a Walt Disney movie!”\n\nDe Caunes told me, “I looked at him and I said—it took all my courage, but I said, ‘I’ve always hated Walt Disney movies.’ And then I left. I slammed the door.” She was shaking on the stairs going down to the lobby. A director she was working with on the TV show confirmed that she arrived at the studio distraught and that she recounted what had happened. Weinstein called relentlessly over the next few hours, offering de Caunes gifts and repeating his assertion that nothing had happened.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nIn 2014, Harvey Weinstein invited Emily Nestor to a hotel.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Russia’s Putin battles to regain control after short-lived revolt\nContent: Members of Wagner group looks from a military vehicle in Rostov-on-Don late on June 24, 2023. Roman Romokhov | AFP | Getty Images\n\nThe recent Wagner rebellion exposed deep divisions within Russia's military forces, raising questions about what it all means for the mercenary group's fighters and the war in Ukraine. In the space of just a few chaotic hours on June 24, the Wagner Group launched an apparent insurrection by sending an armored convoy toward the Russian capital. It marked what many regard as the greatest challenge to Russian President Vladimir Putin's authority in his more than two decades in power. The short-lived rebellion was abruptly called off, however, when Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin agreed to de-escalate the situation and ordered his fighters advancing on Moscow to return to their bases. The fallout has left many observers of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine asking what next for the Wagner Group's future, both in Europe and across the globe. The Institute for the Study of War, a U.S.-based think tank, said in its latest Russia offensive campaign assessment that the Kremlin may seek to assume formal control of the Wagner Group and turn it into a state-owned enterprise, although it is not yet clear if this is the Kremlin's intention.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin meets with servicemen at the Kremlin in Moscow on June 27, 2023. Mikhail Tereshchenko | AFP | Getty Images\n\n\"The nationalization of Wagner would likely aid in the Russian Ministry of Defense's (MoD) effort to subsume existing Wagner personnel into the regular Russian Armed Forces through contracts,\" the ISW said Thursday. \"The Kremlin has not indicated that it intends to nationalize Wagner, and it is possible that Putin has yet to determine what course of action to take in subordinating the group more firmly under the Kremlin's control.\" Putin said Tuesday that members of the Wagner mercenary group was entirely funded and fully supplied by the state. It was the first time the long-time Russian president had publicly acknowledged the group was funded by the Kremlin. The ISW also noted recent satellite imagery collected between June 15 to June 27 appeared to show the active construction of a speculated new Wagner base in Asipovichy, Belarus. The site, the think tank said, is within 15 kilometers (9.3 miles) of a large Belarusian combine arms training ground. It adds that Wagner personnel may deploy elsewhere in Belarus, however, and \"there is nothing particularly unique\" about a potential Wagner base in Asipovichy. Wagner Group's Prigiozhin arrived in Belarus on Tuesday shortly after agreeing to leave Russia in a deal brokered by Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko. Belarus is an ally of Russia in Putin's war in Ukraine.\n\nWhat next for Wagner's fighters?\n\nAnalysts told CNBC earlier this week that the fallout of the Wagner revolt could mean Russia's most effective unit in Ukraine was now out of the war, potentially weakening the performance of Moscow's forces on the battlefield. The Pentagon has since said, however, that the U.S. continues to see \"some elements\" of the Wagner Group in Russian-occupied territory in Ukraine. \"In terms of the future of Wagner Group, that's really a question best addressed by Russia, which of course … funds the Wagner Group, and how they will be employed going throughout the rest of this conflict and elsewhere around the world, since ... they also conduct operations in Africa, as well as Syria,\" Pentagon spokesman Brigadier General Pat Ryder told reporters on Thursday.\n\nBANGUI, Central African Republic - March 22, 2023: A Russian flag hangs on the monument of the Russian instructors in Bangui, during a march in support of Russia and China's presence in the Central African Republic. Wagner Group has been active in the country since 2018, supporting President Faustin-Archange Touadéra's government and filling a security vacuum left by France. BARBARA DEBOUT/AFP via Getty Images\n\nAsked in a news briefing how many Wagner fighters were currently active in Ukraine following last weekend's uprising, Ryder said some units of the mercenary group were still in the country but declined to provide a ballpark figure. \"That's something that we'll continue to keep an eye on. It's just too early to tell right now,\" Ryder said. \"My observation in all of this analysis on what could happen next is that there is a danger of not seeing the wood for the trees,\" Christopher Granville, managing director of global political research at TS Lombard, told CNBC via telephone. It's essential to remain focused on the battle in Ukraine, Granville said, noting that Putin's political future is dependent on the war's outcome. \"That's really what it boils down to,\" he added. At best, Granville said the Wagner Group was likely to be \"a shadow of its former self\" in Ukraine following the revolt.\n\nRussia's political crisis\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Friday dismissed questions about a political crisis. Speaking at a news conference, Lavrov said that Moscow always emerges stronger and more resilient from any difficulties, Reuters reported. He added that if the West had doubts about Russia's stability, that was their problem. Elsewhere, Russian Gen. Sergei Surovikin, the deputy commander of Russian forces fighting in Ukraine, was believed to have been detained following the Wagner revolt, the Associated Press reported Thursday, citing two people familiar with the matter and Ukrainian intelligence assessments. CNBC was not able to independently verify the report. It comes amid intense speculation about whether Surovikin played a role in the Wagner uprising.\n\nwatch now\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nWagner forces advanced towards Moscow with a column of armored vehicles.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Asylum seekers are wrapping themselves in blankets and keeping a community fire ablaze in a migrant camp near the border. Community organizers in Austin, San Antonio and other major Texas cities are hustling to rescue the unhoused as hypothermia and frostbite set in.\n\nWhile the dangerously cold weather and accompanying power outages sweeping the Lone Star State are touching nearly all Texans in some way, the crisis is especially dire for the state’s most vulnerable and marginalized communities — whose lives have already been threatened by disaster, disease and destitution in recent years. Many were simply trying not to freeze to death inside their homes and cars and on the streets as they braced for another storm Tuesday night.\n\nTexas’s crippled energy system cannot generate enough electricity to power the millions of homes on its grid — from sprawling suburban mansions to the houses and apartments occupied by families already suffering from hunger and poverty. A vivid metaphor for the state’s entrenched inequities emerged Monday night: The illuminated Texas skylines of downtown buildings and newly filled luxury hotels cast against the darkened silhouettes of freezing neighborhoods.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOver one million residents in Texas remained without electricity on Feb. 16 after a historic cold outbreak and snow storm. (Video: Justin Scuiletti, Amber Ferguson/The Washington Post)\n\nWhile local governments have maneuvered to open warming centers and respond to acute emergencies, it has often been exhausted neighbors, depleted community and faith leaders, overly taxed nonprofits and everyday people who are meeting immediate needs in the face of a state government that some say has been absent from the lives of those most vulnerable. Offering help now comes with the threat of possible exposure to the coronavirus.\n\n“Texas thinks it’s some big, bad independent state, but we can’t get the power on. We need to rethink how we do things,” said Chas Moore of the Austin Justice Coalition. “When disaster hits, it hits those communities that we historically disregard and don’t pay enough attention to.”\n\nThe blanket of snow that had at first seemed like a blessing in San Antonio turned ominous as people experiencing homelessness were thrust into life-threatening danger.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I didn’t think I’d wake up alive,” said 86-year-old Angel Rodriguez Medina, who spent Monday night in a sleeping bag amid piles of snow. “It was the worst night of my life.”\n\nMorgan Handley, a case manager with Centro San Antonio, welcomed the man into a heated car on Tuesday morning but worried about the many others he had yet to reach. A coalition of social services groups had been driving around the city in recent days and rescued more than 50 people. They were taken to converted gyms and churches — anywhere that had electricity.\n\n“I’m terrified they’re going to die,” Handley said. “Last year I lost six clients. . . . I’m terrified to see how that number is going to increase in the next few days.”\n\nA little more than an hour north, Yasmine Smith spent the weekend trying to coordinate housing for more than 200 people in hotels and shelters. Her own south Austin home has no power, and she destroyed her coffee table to have wood for the chimney. Smith said she does what she can because she can’t bear the thought of someone dying under a bridge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I believe in my city as a lifelong Austinite, and I’m proud of Texas,” said Smith, the director of justice and advocacy for the Austin-area Urban League. “But this fell on the shoulders of average people who also had to ensure their own lives were saved.”\n\nSome of the most widespread and longest-lasting power outages hit Southeast Texas and greater Houston, the state’s biggest city. A mother and daughter died after their family of four suffered carbon monoxide poisoning while warming up inside their car in the garage as temperatures plunged into the single digits.\n\nThe question of when power may be restored has yet to be answered for those who rely on electricity to survive or recover from severe illness. Ralph Riviello, chair of emergency medicine at University Health in San Antonio, said about a dozen people have come into the system’s emergency rooms needing help to recharge the batteries of their breathing machines and feeding tubes.\n\nIn Dallas, Deondre Moore raised a few hundred dollars on Facebook to buy blankets and toiletries for about a dozen people living in downtown streets. Less than 12 hours later, the temperature in Moore’s power-less apartment dropped to 20 degrees, and he had to seek shelter at a friend’s home that was still heated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFaith leaders have been reaching out to parishioners who may not live in adequate housing or have access to most public benefits. Lupita Valdez, a pastoral associate at Sacred Heart church in west San Antonio, maintains a WhatsApp group chat of more than 200 parishioners who are broken up into smaller groups to help one another.\n\nThat is how Kimberly Briseño, 23, an undocumented immigrant from Nicaragua, was connected to a fellow parishioner. She has electricity but no central heat or water in her thin-walled dwelling, which was designed as an in-law suite. She, her husband and her 5-year-old daughter stay in one room with a donated space heater all day.\n\nHer 25-year-old husband hasn’t been able to work for two weeks, and the church is helping Briseño apply for a special rental assistance grant from the city. But their meals and comfort come from a woman at church.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I’ve never experienced cold like this before. We didn’t have the right clothes or know what we needed,” said Briseño, who layered short-sleeved shirts and pajama pants to stay warm. “If it wasn’t for this lady, I don’t know what we’d do. She has taken us in like we were members of her family.”\n\nLotus Rios learned early in her youth that when one person in the community falls, everyone falls. It’s a saying her grandmother invoked often.\n\n“When you take care of people, the community takes care of you,” said Rios, who owns a community pantry she opened early in the pandemic. She stopped by the southside San Antonio house of Michael Muñoz late Tuesday to bring him menudo, a Mexican soup.\n\nThe power outage “reopens a wound for a lot of these people. The deficiencies that were already existing, all these little gaps, just got wider with covid, and now with this — this is even making it wider,” Rios said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFour weeks ago, Muñoz learned that his 68-year-old mother whom he cared for full-time had covid-19. Two weeks ago, he watched her casket being lowered into the ground.\n\nThen early Monday, he woke up shivering and learned that the house he and his mother had shared no longer had power. For more than 24 hours, Muñoz has been living in a silent house, with no music to lift his spirits or even the faint hum of the refrigerator, as he processes his mother’s death and what this new obstacle means for his future.\n\n“It’s been hard,” said Muñoz, who had to pause his college studies. “Right now I have nobody here with me, it’s just me. So there’s nobody to say, ‘I’m here with you.’ ”\n\nHis mother’s death brought with it a cascading series of financial troubles that left him strapped for cash and pressed for time as the winter storm arrived. Muñoz brought his dogs inside and wrapped the pipes outside his house in cloth and duct tape, but the precautions did little to help him keep warm in an aging, paint-chipped house with little insulation. He said he’s been charging his phone in the car, eating food he bought at the corner store in the dark and has no Internet to check for weather and news updates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I’ve been trying to roll with it. But yesterday with no power, and it’s just cold, and the dog’s acting up, and the water heater giving up, one thing after another — I had a little breakdown,” he said.\n\nMuñoz said he is frustrated by the mass outages and criticized local officials who he said are not checking in on people in his Harlandale neighborhood, an economically depressed area with poor plumbing, old houses and many elderly residents.\n\nThe 43-year-old aspiring teacher has taken to cleaning the house and sorting through his mother’s old things. Pictures of her still hang on the wall. She called herself a “union, Democrat, Catholic, Mexican American woman” Muñoz said with a chuckle. She drank Jack Daniels on the rocks and led her life independently, he said.\n\n“She raised me to be a strong person,” he said. “I know what I have to do. Hopefully I’ll pull through this and see what the next step is.”\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nAustin and San Antonio issued boil-water notices.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert at causal reasoning."}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n### CONTEXT\n[Doc 1]\nTitle: August 22, 2021\nContent: A week after the Taliban took control of Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, as the U.S. was withdrawing the forces that have been in the country since 2001, the initial chaos created by the Taliban’s rapid sweep across the country has simmered down into what is at least a temporary pattern.\n\nWe knew there was a good chance that the Taliban would regain control of the country when we left, although that was not a foregone conclusion. The former president, Donald Trump, recognized that the American people were tired of the ongoing war in Afghanistan, which was approaching its 20th year, and in February 2020, his administration negotiated with the Taliban to enable the U.S. to withdraw. In exchange for the release of 5000 Taliban fighters and the promise that the U.S. would withdraw within the next 14 months, the Taliban agreed not to attack U.S. soldiers.\n\nTrump’s dislike of the war in Afghanistan reflected the unpopularity of the long engagement, which by 2020 was ill defined. The war had begun in 2001, after terrorists affiliated with al-Qaeda attacked the United States on September 11 of that year. Taliban leaders in control of Afghanistan sheltered al-Qaeda, and after the attacks, the U.S. president, George W. Bush, demanded that Afghanistan hand over the terrorist leader believed to be behind the terrorist attack on the U.S: Osama bin Laden. In October, after Taliban leaders refused, the U.S. launched a bombing campaign.\n\nThat campaign was successful enough that in December 2001 the Taliban offered to surrender. But the U.S. rejected that surrender, determined by then to eradicate the extremist group and fill the vacuum of its collapse with a new, pro-American government. Al-Qaeda leader bin Laden escaped from Afghanistan to Pakistan, and the U.S. project in Afghanistan turned from an anti-terrorism mission into an effort to rebuild the Afghan government into a modern democracy.\n\nBy 2002 the Bush administration was articulating a new doctrine in foreign policy, arguing that the U.S. had a right to strike preemptively against countries that harbor terrorists. In 2003, under this doctrine, the U.S. launched a war on Iraq, which diverted money, troops, and attention from Afghanistan. The Taliban regrouped and began to regain the territory it had lost after the U.S. first began its bombing campaign in 2001.\n\nBy 2005, Bush administration officials privately worried the war in Afghanistan could not be won on its current terms, especially with the U.S. focused on Iraq. Then, when he took office in 2009, President Barack Obama turned his attention back to Afghanistan. He threw more troops into that country, bringing their numbers close to 100,000. In 2011, the U.S. military located bin Laden in Abbottabad, Pakistan, and launched a raid on the compound where he was hiding, killing him. By 2014, Obama had drawn troops in Afghanistan down to about 11,000, and in December of that year, he announced that the mission of the war—weakening the Taliban and capturing bin Laden—had been accomplished, and thus the war was over. The troops would come home.\n\nBut, of course, they didn’t, leaving Trump to develop his own policy. But his administration’s approach to the chaos in that country was different than his predecessor’s. By negotiating with the Taliban and excluding the Afghan government the U.S. had been supporting, the Trump team essentially accepted that the Taliban were the most important party in Afghanistan. The agreement itself reflected the oddity of the negotiations. Each clause referring to the Taliban began: “The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan which is not recognized by the United States as a state and is known as the Taliban will….”\n\nIt was immediately clear that the Taliban was not living up to its side of the bargain. Although it did stop attacking U.S. troops, It began to escalate violence in Afghanistan itself, assassinated political opponents, and maintained ties to al-Qaeda. Nonetheless, the Trump administration put pressure on the leaders of the Afghan government to release the 5000 Taliban prisoners, and they eventually did. Before Biden took office, Trump dropped the U.S. troop engagement in Afghanistan from about 13,000 to about 2500.\n\nWhen he took office, Biden had to decide whether to follow Trump’s path or to push back on the Taliban on the grounds they were not honoring the agreement Trump’s people had hammered out. Biden himself wanted to get out of the war. At the same time, he recognized that fighting the Taliban again would mean throwing more troops back into Afghanistan, and that the U.S. would again begin to take casualties. He opted to get the troops out, but extended the deadline to September 11, 2021, the twentieth anniversary of the initial attack. (Former president Trump complained that the troops should come out faster.)\n\nWhat Biden did not foresee was the speed with which the Taliban would retake control of the country. It swept over the regional capitals and then Kabul in about nine days in mid-August with barely a shot fired, and the head of the Afghan government fled the country, leaving it in chaos.\n\nThat speed left the U.S. flatfooted. Afghans who had been part of the government or who had helped the U.S. and its allies rushed to the airport to try to escape. In the pandemonium of that first day, up to seven people were killed; two people appear to have clung to a U.S. military plane as it took off, falling to their deaths.\n\nAnd yet, the Taliban, so far, has promised amnesty for its former opponents and limited rights for women. It has its own problems, as the Afghan government has been supported for the previous 20 years by foreign money, including a large percentage from the U.S. Not only has that money dried up as foreign countries refuse to back the Taliban, but also Biden has put sanctions on Afghanistan and also on some Pakistanis suspected of funding the Taliban. At the same time it appears that no other major sponsor, like Russia or China, has stepped in to fill the vacuum left by U.S. money, leaving the Taliban fishing for whatever goodwill it can find.\n\nYesterday, Josh Marshall of Talking Points Memo flagged tweets showing that members of the Afghan government, including the brother of the president who fled, are in what appear from the photos posted on Twitter to be relaxed talks about forming a new government. Other factions in Afghanistan would like to stop this from happening, and today Biden’s national security adviser Jake Sullivan warned that ISIS-K, another extremist group, is threatening to attack the airport to destabilize the Taliban.\n\nMeanwhile, there are 10,000 people crowded into that airport, and U.S. evacuations continue. The Kabul airport is secure—for now—and the U.S. military has created a larger perimeter around it for protection. The U.S. government has asked Americans in Afghanistan to shelter in place until they can be moved out safely; the Qatari ambassador to Afghanistan has been escorting groups of them to the airport. Evacuations have been slower than hoped because of backlogs at the next stage of the journey, but the government has enlisted the help of 18 commercial airlines to move those passengers forward, leaving room for new evacuees.\n\nYesterday, about 7800 evacuees left the Kabul airport. About 28,000 have been evacuated since August 14.\n\nInterestingly, much of the U.S. media is describing this scenario as a disaster for President Biden. Yet, on CNN this morning, Matthew Dowd, who was the chief strategist for the Bush-Cheney ticket in 2004, noted that more than 20,000 people have been evacuated from Afghanistan without a single loss of an American life, while in the same period of time, 5000 Americans have died from Covid-19 and 500 have died from gunshots.\n\n—-\n\nNotes:\n\nhttps://www.npr.org/2020/02/29/810537586/u-s-signs-peace-deal-with-taliban-after-nearly-2-decades-of-war-in-afghanistan\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2021/08/12/obama-afghan-war-ending-afghanistan-papers-book-excerpt/\n\nhttps://www.factcheck.org/2021/08/timeline-of-u-s-withdrawal-from-afghanistan/\n\nhttps://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/you-wouldnt-know-it-from-the-us-news-coverage-but\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/16/kabul-airport-chaos-and-panic-as-afghans-and-foreigners-attempt-to-flee-the-capital\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2021/08/22/afghanistan-biden-evacuations/\n\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2021/08/21/politics/kabul-airport-terror-warning/index.html\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/08/17/treasury-taliban-money-afghanistan/\n\nShare\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nOn August 15, 2021, the Taliban seized the presidential palace in Kabul and declared the war over.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Min Aung Hlaing would be in charge of the country for one year. It said the seizure was necessary because the government had not acted on the military's claims of fraud in November’s elections — in which Suu Kyi's ruling party won a majority of the parliamentary seats up for grabs — and because it allowed the election to go ahead despite the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe takeover came the morning the country’s new parliamentary session was to begin and follows days of concern that a coup was coming. The military maintains its actions are legally justified — citing a section of the constitution it drafted that allows it to take control in times of national emergency — though Suu Kyi’s party spokesman, as well as many international observers, have said it amounts to a coup.\n\nIt was a dramatic backslide for Myanmar, which was emerging from decades of strict military rule and international isolation that began in 1962. It was also a shocking fall from power for Suu Kyi, a Nobel peace laureate who had lived under house arrest for years as she tried to push her country toward democracy and then became its de facto leader after her National League for Democracy won elections in 2015.\n\nWhile Suu Kyi had been a fierce antagonist of the army while under house arrest, since her release and return to politics, she has had to work with the country's generals, who never fully gave up power. While the 75-year-old has remained wildly popular at home, Suu Kyi's deference to the generals — going so far as to defend their crackdown on Rohingya Muslims that the United States and others have labeled genocide — has left her reputation internationally in tatters.\n\n**Related:** A distant refuge: Portraits of the Rohingya in Portland, Oregon\n\nFor some, Monday's takeover was seen as confirmation that the military holds ultimate power despite the veneer of democracy. New York-based Human Rights Watch has previously described the clause in the constitution that the military invoked as a “coup mechanism in waiting.”\n\nThe embarrassingly poor showing of the military-backed party in the November vote may have been the spark.\n\nLarry Jagan, an independent analyst, said the takeover was just a “pretext for the military to reassert their full influence over the political infrastructure of the country and to determine the future, at least in the short term,” adding that the generals do not want Suu Kyi to be a part of that future.\n\nThe coup now presents a test for the international community, which had ostracized Myanmar while it was under military rule and then enthusiastically embraced Suu Kyi’s government as a sign the country was finally on the path to democracy. There will likely be calls for a reintroduction of at least some of the sanctions the country had long faced.\n\nThe first signs that the military was planning to seize power were reports that Suu Kyi and Win Myint, the country’s president, had been detained before dawn.\n\nMyo Nyunt, a spokesman for Suu Kyi’s party, told the online news service The Irrawaddy that in addition to Suu Kyi and the president, members of the party’s Central Executive Committee, many of its lawmakers and other senior leaders had also been taken into custody.\n\nTelevision signals were cut across the country, as was phone and internet access in Naypyitaw, the capital, while passenger flights were grounded. Phone service in other parts of the country was also reported down, though people were still able to use the internet in many areas.\n\nAs word of the military’s actions spread in Yangon, the country’s biggest city, there was a growing sense of unease among residents who earlier in the day had packed into tea shops for breakfast and went about their morning shopping.\n\nBy midday, people were removing the bright red flags of Suu Kyi’s party that once adorned their homes and businesses. Lines formed at ATMs as people waited to take out cash, efforts that were being complicated by internet disruptions. Workers at some businesses decided to go home.\n\nSuu Kyi's party released a statement on one of its Facebook pages saying the military’s actions were unjustified and went against the constitution and the will of voters. The statement urged people to oppose Monday’s “coup” and any return to “military dictatorship.” It was not possible to confirm who posted the message as party members were not answering phone calls.\n\nThe military's actions also received international condemnation and many countries called for the release of the detained leaders.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken expressed “grave concern and alarm” over the reported detentions.\n\n“We call on Burmese military leaders to release all government officials and civil society leaders and respect the will of the people of Burma as expressed in democratic elections,” he wrote in a statement, using Myanmar's former name.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called the developments a “serious blow to democratic reforms,” according to his spokesman.\n\nThe U.N. high commissioner for human rights said in a statement that, in addition to politicians, the people detained included human rights defenders, journalists and activists.\n\nIn addition to announcing that the commander in chief would be charge, the military TV report said Vice President Myint Swe would be elevated to acting president. Myint Swe is a former general best known for leading a brutal crackdown on Buddhist monks in 2007. He is a close ally of Than Shwe, the junta leader who ruled Myanmar for nearly two decades.\n\nIn a later announcement, the military said an election would be held in a year and the military would hand power to the winner.\n\nThe military justified its move by citing a clause in the 2008 constitution, implemented during military rule, that says in cases of national emergency, the government’s executive, legislative and judicial powers can be handed to the military commander-in-chief.\n\nIt is just one of many parts of the charter that ensured the military could maintain ultimate control over the country. The military is allowed to appoint its members to 25% of seats in Parliament and it controls several key ministries involved in security and defense.\n\nIn November polls, Suu Kyi's party captured 396 out of 476 seats up for actual election in the lower and upper houses of Parliament.\n\nThe military has charged that there was massive fraud in the election — particularly with regard to voter lists — though it has not offered any convincing evidence. The state Union Election Commission last week rejected its allegations.\n\nConcerns of a takeover grew last week when a military spokesman declined to rule out the possibility of a coup when asked by a reporter to do so at a news conference on Tuesday.\n\nThen on Wednesday, the military chief told senior officers in a speech that the constitution could be revoked if the laws were not being properly enforced. An unusual deployment of armored vehicles in the streets of several large cities also stoked fears.\n\nOn Saturday and Sunday, however, the military denied it had threatened a coup, accusing unnamed organizations and media of misrepresenting its position.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nVice President Myint Swe was installed as acting President.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

After 17 years of being called Facebook, the social networking parent company behind Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus has a new name.\n\nFacebook’s corporate entity is now Meta.\n\nFacebook creator Mark Zuckerberg announced the change at the company’s AR/VR-focused Connect event, sharing that the new title captured more of the company’s core ambition: to build the metaverse.\n\n“To reflect who we are and what we hope to build, I am proud to announce that starting today, our company is now Meta. Our mission remains the same — it’s still about bringing people together. Our apps and our brands — they’re not changing either,” Zuckerberg said. “From now on, we’re going to be metaverse-first, not Facebook-first.”\n\nThe name change comes at a… convenient time for Facebook, which has seen a sustained backlash to its brand, particularly in recent weeks after a former employee leaked a trove of documents to the media and government bodies detailing the missteps Facebook has made over the years in building out its platform responsibly. Facebook had been laying the groundwork for this change for months, seemingly in an effort to move its core branding further from the relentless negative headlines surrounding its most popular product, which has been a lightning rod for angst among consumers.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $475 on your TechCrunch All Stage pass Build smarter.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\n\nIn July, CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced in a Verge profile that Facebook was betting it all on the metaverse. It was a surprise announcement for the trillion-dollar company, mainly because while Facebook has spent plenty of money and effort on virtual reality hardware, its social VR products have largely been short-lived failures and it had said barely anything about its beta Horizons social platform since announcing it more than a year-and-a-half earlier.\n\nIn August, Facebook organized an unusually large press push around a VR app designed to let people take meetings in VR. Zuckerberg hit the morning shows and dedicated a surprising amount of effort toward showcasing the small VR app.\n\nIn September, in a blog post called “Building the Metaverse Responsibly,” Facebook announced a $50 million fund dedicated toward investment in research “to ensure these products are developed responsibly.” This month, Facebook announced a smaller $10 million creator fund for developers on its nascent Horizon Worlds platform, and also detailed that it planned to hire a whopping 10,000 employees in the EU specifically to build out their metaverse platform.\n\nLast week, a story in The Verge floated that Facebook was mulling a name change to their corporate entity.\n\nUltimately, distancing the company’s core business from a product associated with the most problems is an unsurprising move for them, but changing its name to Meta will require Facebook to align its core brand with a product that could be years from relevancy and could encounter many failures on the way to potential mainstream success. Facebook still has 2.5 billion users, while their metaverse products likely have a few thousand users, at most.\n\nA major name change from one of tech’s biggest companies isn’t without precedent. In 2015, Google rolled out a new corporate structure of its own, creating a parent company known as Alphabet. Google remains a subsidiary of Alphabet, but colloquially most people still call anything having to do with the company or its subsidiaries “Google,” for better or worse. After almost two decades of building its brand and growing its products to almost three billion monthly users, Facebook can probably expect the same treatment.\n\nWhile Google wasn’t trying to put distance between itself and its own name, Facebook has very different reasons for a rebrand. The company’s business continues to soar, but its brand has taken a beating in recent years, from Russian election disinformation in 2016, to major privacy lapses like the Cambridge Analytica scandal and now the flurry of ongoing revelations from Frances Haugen, a former member of Facebook’s civic integrity team turned Facebook whistleblower.\n\nFacebook is also arguably under more regulatory scrutiny at the moment than any other company in the tech industry. In Congress, where lawmakers seldom agree on anything, Republicans and Democrats have united in their shared distaste for the company’s unfettered growth, cutthroat business tactics and concerns over Instagram’s detrimental effects on teen mental health.\n\nDuring a Senate hearing last week with TikTok, Snap and YouTube, each social media company scrambled to explicitly contrast their own business practices with Facebook. YouTube posited that it didn’t “prioritize profits over safety.” Snap pointed to its own focus on ephemeral conversations, while TikTok argued that it thinks carefully about the wellbeing of teen users. But the efforts by Facebook’s peers appeared to be in vain.\n\n“Being different from Facebook is not a defense,” Senator Richard Blumenthal said. “That bar is in the gutter.”\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nAndrew Bosworth announced the retirement of the Oculus name.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

The dangerous storm, part of a series of weather systems sweeping the country this week, resulted in accumulating snow and ice across a wide swath of states that rarely see wintry precipitation, including heavily populated areas of Texas. The storm knocked out power to more than 4 million households in Texas, raising questions about the durability of the power grid in the United States’ second-most-populated state, and one of its fastest growing.\n\nThe electricity issues, which authorities warned could in some places persist for days, resulted in blackouts that prevented residents from being able to heat their homes, cook meals or work remotely. The power cuts even knocked out electricity at a Houston-area warehouse where 8,000 doses of coronavirus vaccine were stored, forcing health officials to rush to distribute 4,000 of them to anyone they could before the doses spoiled.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n“The Texas electric system is facing an unprecedented power shortage situation due to the extreme winter weather impacting the entire state, including Houston & the region,” CenterPoint Energy, which serves more than 2 million customers in the Houston area, said in a statement Monday. “Texans’ electricity consumption needs have far surpassed current power generation.”\n\nThe severity of the blackouts, which analysts said were a sign that governments and utility companies did not prepare adequately for the storm, were traced to soaring consumer demand for heat as well as the inherent dangers that extreme cold poses for Southern power systems that were built to handle summer heat over frigid winter.\n\n“To see this kind of impact on a wide scale across the grid is very unusual, particularly in the winter,” said Rebecca Miller, a Texas energy analyst for Wood Mackenzie consulting firm. Miller said the rolling blackouts on Monday are the only things that prevented the state’s electricity transmission from collapsing. “But I was expecting a little bit more preparation. . . . What we really saw was a bit more of a reactive response than a proactive one.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Texas, rolling blackouts were also reported in the major population centers of Houston, Dallas, Austin and San Antonio, where snow and sleet reached the Alamo. Snow even accumulated on the beach in Galveston, a city where residents are far more accustomed to hurricanes than they are to wintry weather.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAs power outages in Texas multiplied on Monday afternoon, even as the snow had stopped in most places, Gov. Greg Abbott (R) went on Twitter to push back at suggestions that the state was facing a catastrophic power failure. Abbott also activated the National Guard to help usher residents to 135 warming locations.\n\n“The Texas power grid has not been compromised,” Abbott wrote. “The ability of some companies that generate the power has been frozen. This includes the natural gas & coal generators. They are working to get generation back on line.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut across the state, even residents of major cities were forced to rethink some of the basics to get through the day.\n\nSayra De La Cruz, 37, said she and her boyfriend woke up in Houston on Monday morning without electricity and no water because of frozen pipes. Without a way to flush the toilets, she decided to collect snow and melt enough of it for two flushes.\n\n“It’s definitely hard because the shoveling in itself — that’s some cardio right there,” said De La Cruz, adding that she was filling both of her bathtubs with snow so it can melt slowly.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nOklahoma Gas and Electric, the state’s largest utility, also announced Monday that it implemented intermittent controlled service interruptions — an unprecedented measure for the company. The blackouts were in effect for about two hours, but they may return depending on capacity, spokesman Brian Alford said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the storm moved north into the Ohio Valley on Monday afternoon, so did the problems.\n\nIn Louisiana, icy conditions prompted authorities to close dozens of highways and bridges, including sections of Interstate 10. Icy roads were reported in at least 74 of Mississippi’s 84 counties, which Gov. Tate Reeves (R) told the Weather Channel was complicating efforts to restore power to more than 61,000 residents. In Arkansas, Little Rock was paralyzed by a two-inch-per-hour snowfall rate, the National Weather Service reported.\n\nIn Kentucky, Gov. Andy Beshear (D) sent the National Guard door to door in remote rural communities to urge residents — some of whom have been without power since a storm last week — to move into shelters. Beshear urged everyone to take the storm seriously.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“We did not make it through almost a year of a pandemic to lose people to a snow or ice storm,” Beshear said in a televised address. “You have more ability to work remotely. You have more ways to connect to one another and get things done. We are looking at coming out of this pandemic by summer, so please do not let the next couple of days or this week be what injures you or causes the loss of a loved one.”\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAt one point Monday, the Weather Service had winter storm warnings issued from Brownsville, Tex., along the U.S.-Mexico border to Caribou, Maine, a distance of more than 2,500 miles.\n\nIn New York, where every county was under a winter weather advisory or warning Monday night, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) urged residents to stay home.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the residents of the South have been hardest hit by the storm, which meteorologists warn could be replicated in the coming days as another storm system is predicted to follow a similar track and collide with a cold snap.\n\nThe bitter cold is affecting about 30 states, with temperatures as much as 50 degrees below normal.\n\nGeorge Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston dipped to 17 degrees early Monday, the coldest reading observed there since Dec. 23, 1989. Tuesday’s morning low could be even more frigid: the Weather Service forecast is 11. The wind chill on Tuesday morning is expected to be 1.\n\n“Dangerous life and property threatening bitterly cold air will continue even as the precipitation ends,” the Weather Service in Houston wrote early Monday.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nFarther north, wind chills early Monday plunged as low as minus-40 and minus-50 in parts of Nebraska, Kansas and Colorado.\n\nIn Texas, the power outages were tied to record-high demand, an electrical grid that is independent from surrounding states, low natural-gas supplies, along with sky-high prices, and reduced output from the state’s wind turbines.\n\nThe Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), the umbrella organization that oversees the state’s power grid, warned that it would continue to implement mainly short-term, rolling blackouts across the state.\n\nThere have been three in­stances of rotating outages during an Energy Emergency Alert because of weather events in Texas, with the first occurring in 1989, according to ERCOT. Energy demand in the Lone Star State is expected to hit an all-time high.­\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Monday evening, 4.3 million outages were reported in Texas — more than one-third of customers in the state, according to poweroutage.us.\n\n“Every grid operator and every electric company is fighting to restore power right now,” ERCOT president and chief executive Bill Magness said.\n\nMiller, the Texas energy analyst, said the strain on Texas’s power grid was more reminiscent of the types of failures that could occur during a major hurricane. But even there, Miller noted, those hurricane-related power failures are usually limited to a specific corner of the state. This threat encompasses nearly the entire state.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nJesse Jenkins, an assistant professor of engineering at Princeton’s Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment, said the extreme weather pushed Texas’s energy capabilities past the breaking point as chilled Texans tried to heat their homes.\n\nThe state was already dealing with higher seasonal demand because of the pandemic, with more people at home drawing power instead of clustered in work­places during the day, Jenkins added.\n\nThe outcome of the current power crisis will force a discussion about the future of the Texas energy system and raise questions about the state’s outlier approach to power, Jenkins told The Washington Post.\n\n“It’s not just an event you move past; there were significant discussions about the 2011 blackouts, and last summer’s blackouts in California,” Jenkins said. “These are the kinds of events that have significant policy and political ramifications.”\n\nTexas remains the only state to operate on an independent power grid, which is run by ERCOT. The state’s electricity market runs on an energy market, which Jenkins said works like Uber’s surge pricing: Rather than power companies being paid to make sure they have generators on call during times of high demand, they are paid only when they provide power.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIn Austin, Cody Miller, 36, had been without power since about 1:30 a.m. Monday. By 10 a.m., the temperature in his East Austin home was hovering near 50 degrees, with no clear information from the utility companies about when power might be restored.\n\nIt was the second time in a week he had lost power after enduring a 10-hour outage on Thursday. “There’s no real communication and 311 is pretty much down,” said Miller, who works in the telecom industry.\n\nIn parts of Dallas, residents lost electricity and water because of frozen pipes.\n\nBrandon Friedman, 42, who lives in northeastern Dallas, had been without power since about 2 a.m. and had no water despite leaving the faucets open slightly to drip.\n\nSpeaking to The Post from his car where he was charging his phone, Friedman described his driveway — blanketed in five inches of snow — and his regret at leaving one household item behind for the new residents when he moved from Virginia back to Dallas four years ago.\n\n“I left our snow shovel hanging up in the garage in Virginia because we weren’t going to need it in Texas,” Friedman said.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nBurst pipes led to widespread water disruptions, affecting over 15 million people in Texas.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

The #MeToo movement went viral, spurring a national and global discussion on the issue.\n\nMany women have since come forward with their experiences of being sexually harassed by colleagues and bosses, costing influential men in the entertainment industry and the media — including journalists here at NPR — their jobs.\n\nAnd yet, there has been little data collected on the national prevalence of sexual harassment, says Michele Decker, director of the women's health and rights program at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. As a result, many people have asked, \"Where's the evidence?\" she says.\n\nNow an online survey launched in January by a nonprofit called Stop Street Harassment offers some of that missing evidence. It found that 81 percent of women and 43 percent of men had experienced some form of sexual harassment during their lifetime.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThose numbers are much larger than suggested by other recent polls. Those polls used a more limited sample or narrower definitions of harassment, says Anita Raj, director of the Center on Gender Equity and Health at the University of California, San Diego, who analyzed the results of the new survey.\n\nThe new survey, on the other hand, included a larger, more nationally representative sample of men and women ages 18 and above, says Raj.\n\nThe survey also involved a broader definition of sexual harassment that includes the \"continuum of experiences\" that women face, she says.\n\nLoading...\n\nThat includes verbal forms of sexual harassment, like being catcalled or whistled at or getting unwanted comments of a sexual nature. It also includes physical harassment, cyber harassment and sexual assaults.\n\nThe results, released in a report Wednesday, show that 77 percent of women had experienced verbal sexual harassment, and 51 percent had been sexually touched without their permission. About 41 percent said they had been sexually harassed online, and 27 percent said they had survived sexual assault.\n\nThe report also looked into locations where people experienced harassment. The majority of women — 66 percent — said they'd been sexually harassed in public spaces. \"The public forums are where you see the more chronic experiences of sexual harassment,\" says Raj. These include verbal harassment and physical harassment, like touching and groping.\n\nHowever, 38 percent of women said they experienced sexual harassment at the workplace. Thirty-five percent said they had experienced it at their residence. These experiences are more likely to be assaults and the \"most severe forms\" of harassment, says Raj.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"The findings show that this is a pervasive problem and permeates all sectors of our lives,\" says Holly Kearl, the main author of the report. \"Most people who said they had experienced sexual harassment experienced it in multiple locations.\"\n\n\"Sexual harassment until more recently has been viewed as part and parcel of what people experienced,\" says Decker, who wasn't involved in the survey. As a result, public health researchers don't monitor it. \"It's often been dismissed, because it's considered not as egregious as sexual assault or rape.\"\n\nRape and sexual violence are closely monitored by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey. As a result, public health agencies and health workers are more aware of their prevalence and have been able to take steps to help victims and offer programs aimed at preventing sexual violence.\n\nThe new report shows that sexual harassment, too, is worth monitoring, says Decker. \"We want to know that we're responding to things that are prevalent and common, and this is showing that sexual harassment is really prevalent.\"\n\nLoading...\n\nOne of the most striking findings from the report is that there is a very clear \"gender differential,\" she says. While men experience sexual harassment as well, the prevalence is higher for women, as is the intensity of those experiences. It also shows that men are more frequently the perpetrators, she adds.\n\nKearl says she was surprised at how few of the victims confronted their harasser. Instead, they changed their own lives to avoid harassers and reduce their risks of being harassed.\n\n\"They were changing their routes or routines; they were changing jobs, or moving,\" says Kearl.\n\nThe report also shows that most victims suffer from anxiety and depression as well, just like victims of sexual violence. \"It shows how challenging it is to confront someone. You'd rather change your life than confront the harasser,\" she says.\n\nRaj says her own teenage daughter's experience illustrates this. A couple of years ago, her daughter stopped walking to the public library by herself after she was harassed by a group of boys.\n\nLoading...\n\n\"She was walking from her high school in a very privileged, affluent area, an area that most people would define as very safe,\" Raj recalls. \"As she was walking alone around 3 o'clock in the afternoon, there was a group of boys that started calling out to her and saying things like 'nice hips.' And it just made her feel so uncomfortable [that] she didn't walk alone anymore.\"\n\nLike Raj's daughter, most women (and men) first experience sexual harassment pretty early in life — during preteen or teenage years. \"That's really disconcerting,\" says Raj.\n\nSimilarly disconcerting is the fact that most victims don't report their experiences, says Decker. \"People don't even mention it to friends, families.\" And so, sexual harassment is \"thriving on the silence of women,\" granting impunity to perpetrators, she says.\n\nSome of that has been turned upside down by the #MeToo movement, because it broke that silence and made it more culturally acceptable to talk about sexual harassment.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"The next wave of this is to really understand ... what are the barriers to people being able to access reporting process?\" says Decker. \"How can we support people who want to report this if they so choose?\"\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nWomen used social media to share sexual harassment experiences in October 2017, leading to the #MeToo movement going viral.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

That process could take at least two years.\n\nBoris Johnson, the former mayor of London who campaigned for the UK’s departure from the EU, is tipped by bookmakers as Cameron’s likely successor.\n\nJohnson, who was greeted by a booing crowd when he left his home on Friday morning, thanked voters for their decision, pledged that the UK would remain committed to Europe and urged unity.\n\n“I think the electorate have searched in their hearts and answered as honestly as they can,” he said. “They have decided to vote to take back control from a European Union that has become too remote.”\n\nFormer PM: There will be costs\n\nFormer British Prime Minister Tony Blair told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer that UK voters would learn over the next 24 months that leaving Europe will not solve their economic troubles, ease their apprehensions or make Britain more independent in a meaningful way.\n\n“I literally cannot think of a big decision that I was not able to take because of Europe,” Blair said. “There is so much anger at the moment that the anger replaces the more rational answers.”\n\nBlair noted that the United States was facing the same type of political fracturing, brought on by economic turmoil, globalization and anger at immigration.\n\n“Getting out of Europe is not the answer,” he said, noting the UK sells half of its goods and services to the EU. “We are going to have to negotiate ourselves back into that market and it will be much more difficult than these people understand.”\n\nPossible Scottish independence vote\n\nIn Scotland, where support was overwhelmingly in favor of remaining in the EU, Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s First Minister and leader of the dominant Scottish National Party, said the outcome threw into doubt the future of her country’s place in the UK.\n\nShe said the Scottish government will begin preparing legislation for a new independence referendum if the Scottish Parliament decides it wants to hold one. Scots voted down a bid for independence from the UK in 2014.\n\n“Democratically unacceptable,” said Sturgeon in describing the fact that Scotland would be pulled out of the European Union despite the majority of the Scottish people voting to stay in.\n\nMORE: What does Brexit mean for you?\n\nSinn Fein calls for Irish unity\n\nThe Sinn Féin party in Northern Ireland called for a referendum on Irish unity, which could take Northern Ireland out of the UK and join it with the Republic of Ireland, an EU member.\n\nVoters in Northern Ireland voted for the UK to remain in the EU.\n\nSinn Féin President Gerry Adams said the Brexit result could portend tougher border rules – with barriers and custom posts – between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, because it will be the only land border between the EU and the UK.\n\nAdams said such a result would be unacceptable given the vote result in Northern Ireland and could undermine the cooperative relationships and that have developed between the two Irelands since the Good Friday agreement.\n\n“My issue is the north of Ireland is going to be dragged out of the EU on the decision made by people on another island,” said Adams, whose political party is dedicated to the reunification of Ireland.\n\n“We’re calling for a poll, a referendum, on Irish unity, on the border. This (the Brexit vote) has the potential to set back the good work that’s been done in terms of the peace process, building harmony, building infrastructure.”\n\n‘Dying’ institution\n\nAs European leaders faced their own crises, German Chancellor Angela Merkel stressed the “need to make sure that European people feel that the EU wants to improve all our lives.”\n\nShe said she greatly regretted the UK’s decision, but added, “The EU is strong enough to find the right answers today.”\n\nFrench President Francois Hollande called it a “painful choice which I deeply regret for the UK and Europe.”\n\nItaly’s finance minister, Pier Carlo Padoan, warned of a domino effect amid calls for further exit votes.\n\nFar-right Dutch politician Geert Wilders congratulated the UK on its decision and called for a Dutch referendum on EU membership.\n\n“We want to be in charge of our own country, our own money, our own borders and our own immigration policy,” he was quoted as saying in a statement on his website.\n\nMarine Le Pen, the leader of France’s National Front party who plans to run for the French presidency next year, also congratulated the Brexit side.\n\nHer party has suggested the French will also hold an “out” referendum if she assumes the presidency.\n\nPassions continued to run high in the UK in the hours after the vote, with UK Independence Party (UKIP) leader and Leave campaigner Nigel Farage declaring the EU a “dying” institution.\n\n“We’ve given ourselves the chance to rejoin the world,” he told journalists. “June 23rd needs to become a national bank holiday and we will call it Independence Day.”\n\nU.S. President Barack Obama said that while the UK’s relationship with Europe was changing, the ties that bound the UK to the United States and the United States to Europe would remain.\n\n“I do think yesterday’s vote speaks to ongoing changes and challenges that are raised by globalization, but the UK’s relationship with the EU will change. What will not change is the special relationship that exists between our two nations,” Obama said. “That will endure. And the EU will remain one of our indispensable partners.”\n\nMORE: Full coverage of the UK referendum\n\nNATO: UK will stay a strong ally\n\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg voiced reassurances that the United Kingdom will remain a strong and committed NATO ally despite the vote.\n\n“Today, as we face more instability and uncertainty, NATO is more important than ever as a platform for cooperation among European allies and between Europe and North America,” said Stoltenberg. “A strong, united and determined NATO remains an essential pillar of stability in a turbulent world and a key contributor to international peace and security.”\n\nVoters react\n\nThe referendum followed one of the most divisive political campaigns in recent memory. Polls consistently showed voters split down the middle, with the outcome too close to call ahead of the vote.\n\nNews of the decision sparked strong emotions, with those in favor and those against reflecting on a campaign marred by allegations of lies, distrust and hate.\n\n“This is so sad,” said Daniel Trilling on Twitter. “Millions of people aren’t going to feel any more in control of their lives or their country because of this vote.”\n\n“People vote on emotion,” Twitter user @cemanthe posted. “This was won on false promises and emotive texts about immigration. Not on facts.”\n\n“I am SO happy this morning,” wrote another, Gemma.\n\nAn online petition calling for a second referendum gathered more than 120,000 signatures within hours of being posted.\n\nLeading political figures gave mixed reactions.\n\nTony Blair, the former UK prime minister, called the decision a divided result.\n\n“It’s going to be a complicated process but it’s important to bring our country together and stabilize our country,” he told CNN’s Becky Anderson. “It’s still a resilient country and it’s a strong country.”\n\nSadiq Khan, the mayor of largely pro-EU London, said the decision was a “clear message” and urged calm.\n\n‘Taking back control’\n\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk said the decision was “historic, but not a moment for hysterical reactions.”\n\nDonald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee in the U.S. presidential election, hailed the UK’s decision to “reassert control over their own politics, borders and economy.”\n\nIn a news conference Friday as he attended the official opening of a remodeled golf resort bearing his name in Turnberry, Scotland, Trump called the decision of the voters “a great thing.”\n\n“They’re angry over borders, they’re angry over people coming into the country and taking over. Nobody even knows who they are,” he said. “They’re angry about many, many things. They took back control of their country.”\n\nUKIP’s Farage told CNN’s Nima Elbagir that the economic fears in the wake of the EU departure were overstated, and that he expected an even better relationship with the United States. He said the vote was a repudiation of bullying tactics by corporate and political powers to keep the UK in the EU.\n\n“(We were) threatened by everybody that if we didn’t stay part of this political union, dreadful things would happen to us, and what happened were the little people, the regular people, the ordinary people said, ‘No, this is wrong,’” Farage said.\n\n“When you really think about it, what we’ve done isn’t actually that radical. … We want to be a democratic nation. We want to make our own laws in our own parliament, have our own supreme court, and control our own border. If you think about, there’s now 183 countries around the world that have independence days. What we did yesterday was become 184th.”\n\nOpinion: Why Brexit vote should worry Trump\n\nMarkets plunge\n\nThe effects of the vote outcome were immediately felt in markets and economies around the world.\n\nIn New York, the Dow ended the day down more than 611 points, to close at 17,399. London’s FTSE index shed $164 billion of its value in the first 10 minutes of trading, but regained ground later in the day.\n\nThe NASDAQ index fell more than 4% and into a correction, or down 10% from recent highs.\n\nThe British pound at one point plunged more than 12% to below $1.34, its lowest level since 1985. Japan’s Nikkei tanked 6.7% and Hong Kong’s main index dropped 3.7%.\n\nBank of England Governor Mark Carney said the body is “well prepared” and “won’t hesitate” to take additional measures as markets adjust.\n\nThe “UK financial system is resilient,” he added.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nGlobal markets plunged following the Brexit vote.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Those poor people, all at similar ages to my grandchildren, they died anyway,” said Jung Si-hoon, a retiree and a church elder, who placed an old wooden cross at the makeshift altar.\n\n“What more should we say? We should pray for them and wish they rest in peace.”\n\nShops and cafés nearby were closed, and police cordoned off the site of the tragedy as they continued their investigations.\n\nSchools, kindergartens and companies around the country scrapped planned Halloween events. K-pop concerts and government briefings were also cancelled.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“The government will undertake a thorough investigation into what caused this accident and do its best to make necessary institutional changes so that such an accident is not repeated,” Prime Minister Han said as government officials met on the disaster.\n\n“Identification has been completed for all of the 154 deceased except one, and I believe it is time for follow-up measures such as funeral procedures to be carried out in earnest,” Han said. “We will do our best to provide necessary support by reflecting the opinions of the bereaved families as much as possible.”\n\nPresident Yoon Suk-yeol, who has declared a period of national mourning and designated Itaewon a disaster zone, visited a memorial altar outside the Seoul city hall with his wife on Monday to pay his respects to those who died. Former United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon was also among those expressing their condolences.\n\nThe crush of partygoers came as Itaewon, a symbol of freewheeling nightlife in the South Korean capital for decades, was beginning to recover from prolonged pandemic restrictions with new restaurants and shops opening.\n\nThe disaster is the worst in South Korea since the Sewol ferry sank in 2014, killing 304 people, most of them high school students.\n\nThe sinking of the Sewol and criticism of the official response sent shockwaves across South Korea, prompting widespread soul-searching over safety measures that are likely to be renewed in the wake of Saturday’s crush.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nPresident Yoon Suk Yeol vowed to carry out a thorough investigation.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

The reversal came six hours after Trump announced his plan to double import duties on the Canadian metals in response to Ontario's decision to slap a 25% tax on electricity exports to the U.S. Ontario Premier Doug Ford said earlier Tuesday afternoon that he was pausing that surcharge following discussions with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. Navarro was asked on CNBC's \"Closing Bell: Overtime\" if the developments meant that \"we're not going to see 50% tariffs come tomorrow.\" Navarro replied, \"Correct.\" Lutnick \"did a beautiful job negotiating that,\" he said. Ford's threat to add a surcharge on electricity exports to Michigan, New York and Minnesota came in retaliation for the sweeping 25% tariffs that Trump had placed on imports from Canada. The premier earlier in the day had vowed to keep his countermeasures on the U.S. in place, warning, \"There's one person to be blamed if we go into a recession, it will be called the Trump recession.\" But he and Lutnick had a \"productive conversation\" later in the day, and they agreed to meet in Washington, D.C., on Thursday to discuss a \"renewed\" trilateral trade agreement, according to a joint statement from the two men.\n\nTrump's new trade threats\n\nThe moves marked the latest twists in an escalating and increasingly unpredictable trade war between the U.S. and Canada. On Tuesday morning, Trump threw gas on the smoldering conflict with a Truth Social post announcing the new tariffs, while also repeating his calls for Canada to be absorbed into the U.S. as the \"Fifty First State.\" Trump said he was imposing the latest tariffs in response to Ontario's decision to slap a 25% tax on electricity exports to the U.S. That move by Ford was itself issued in retaliation for the sweeping 25% tariffs that Trump had placed on imports from Canada. \"Based on Ontario, Canada, placing a 25% Tariff on \"Electricity\" coming into the United States, I have instructed my Secretary of Commerce to add an ADDITIONAL 25% Tariff, to 50%, on all STEEL and ALUMINUM COMING INTO THE UNITED STATES FROM CANADA, ONE OF THE HIGHEST TARIFFING NATIONS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social on Tuesday morning. \"This will go into effect TOMORROW MORNING, March 12th,\" he wrote.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average extended its losses after Trump's announcement, falling more than 500 points, while the S&P 500 dropped 0.8% and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.4%. Markets were already reeling from the impact of Trump's tariffs and broader fears of a recession. Minutes after Trump's announcement, Ford said he would keep his countermeasure on U.S. energy in place. \"We will not back down. We will be relentless,\" Ford said on MSNBC. \"I apologize to the American people that President Trump decided to have an unprovoked attack on our country, on families, on jobs, and it's unacceptable.\" In an interview on CNBC's \"Money Movers\" later Tuesday morning, Ford said he would be willing to shut off his province's energy supply to the U.S. if Trump \"continues to hurt Canadian families.\" \"I won't hesitate to do that,\" Ford said, adding, \"that's the last thing I want to do.\" Trump imposed tariffs on Canada and Mexico in early February, before delaying them for one month and then reimposing them — and then partially delaying them again.\n\nFord had vowed to keep Ontario's tax in place, despite Trump's latest reprieve. \"There's one person to be blamed, and that's President Trump,\" Ford said on CNBC. \"There's one person to be blamed if we go into a recession, it will be called the Trump recession. No one else.\" A senior administration official told CNBC at the time that Trump had not signed the formal paperwork to raise tariffs on Canada's steel and aluminum, but that the order was \"in the works.\" The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the president's thinking, said Trump's escalation was intended to \"lay down the gauntlet\" in response to Ford's action.\n\nwatch now\n\nSeparately in the Truth Social post Tuesday morning, Trump demanded that Canada \"immediately drop\" an \"Anti-American Farmer Tariff\" on certain U.S. dairy products. He also warned that he \"will shortly be declaring a National Emergency on Electricity within the threatened area.\" \"This will allow the U.S to quickly do what has to be done to alleviate this abusive threat from Canada,\" Trump wrote. The president also declared that if Canada does not lift other \"egregious, long time Tariffs\" on the U.S., he will \"substantially increase\" tariffs on auto imports on April 2. Doing so will \"essentially, permanently shut down the automobile manufacturing business in Canada,\" Trump wrote. Trump, who frequently praises tariffs as an economic multitool, has hyped April 2 as the date when he will impose widespread \"reciprocal tariffs\" on other countries that have their own duties on U.S. goods. Trump's on-again, off-again tariffs on Canada and Mexico have inflamed tensions with both U.S. neighbors. But they have stoked special ire in Canada, where movements have sprung up to boycott U.S. products and political leaders have forcefully denounced Trump's trade war.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nOntario placed a 25% tax on electricity exports to the U.S.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA. Trump previously applied a 25% tariff on many exports from Canada and Mexico.\nB. The 16th Amendment was ratified in 1913.\nC. William McKinley died on Sept. 14, 1901.\nD.

The quake's epicentre was at a depth of just 10 km (6.2 miles), according to the United States Geological Survey.\n\n\"This is very damaging because it has occurred at a shallow depth, so the shockwaves are not dissipated as they go from the focus of the earthquake up to the surface. The buildings received the full force of the shaking.\"\n\n\"It's important not to be focused on epicentres because the seismic waves don't radiate out from the epicentre - they radiate out from the whole line of the fault,\" he added.\n\n## Earthquake today LIVE: UN mobilizing in southeast Asia, its chief says\n\nEarthquake today LIVE: UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Friday that the world body is mobilizing in Southeast Asia to help those in need after a 7.7 magnitude earthquake rocked Myanmar and Thailand.\n\n\"The government of Myanmar has asked for international support, and our team in Myanmar is already in contact in order to fully mobilize our resources in the region to support the people of Myanmar,\" Reuters quoted Guterres as saying.\n\n\"But of course, there are other countries impacted. The epicenter is in Myanmar, and Myanmar is the weakest country in this present situation,\" he added.\n\n## Earthquake today LIVE: US agency analysis predicts thousands of deaths\n\nEarthquake today LIVE: A predictive analysis from a US agency based on the strength and depth of Friday's earthquake in Myanmar and Thailand estimated there could be thousands of deaths and severe economic loss, with Myanmar's Sagaing and Meiktila regions worst hit.\n\n\"Overall, the population in this region resides in structures that are vulnerable to earthquake shaking, though resistant structures exist,\" the USGS analysis said.\n\n## Earthquake today LIVE: What junta chief said\n\nEarthquake today LIVE: The death toll and the number of injuries are likely to rise, junta chief Min Aung Hlaing said in a video speech on state broadcaster MRTV.\n\n“In some areas, buildings collapsed so rescue efforts are still under way,” he said. “As we carry out extensive rescue and relief efforts, I would like to request help.”\n\n## Earthquake today LIVE: 144 dead, over 700 injured in Myanmar; junta chief calls for foreign aid\n\nEarthquake today LIVE: At least 144 people have been killed in Myanmar due to the massive earthquake that hit the country on Friday, the ruling junta chief said, reported AFP.\n\nThe chief, Min Aung Hlaing, also invited \"any country, any organisation\" to help with relief efforts and warned that the toll could go up in a speech aired on state media.\n\n## Earthquake today LIVE: Monastery hit in Madalay\n\nEarthquake today LIVE: The earthquake in Myanmar reportedly brought down multiple buildings in Mandalay, including the Ma Soe Yane monastery.\n\nA video shared on social media showed monks in the street shooting video of the multistory monastery before it suddenly fell to the ground.

Here is what scientists know – and what they are racing to learn – about COVID-19.\n\nWhat is COVID-19?\n\nCOVID-19 is a respiratory infection caused by a virus that is part of the coronavirus family, whose members typically cause the common cold. About 80% of people who become ill have mild symptoms such as fever, dry cough and fatigue, and recover, according to a study of 70,000 COVID-19 patients in China. About 15 to 20% develop serious illness. Those who become severely ill often develop pneumonia and difficulty breathing, and many require mechanical ventilation to help them breathe. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) cited a study found that the overall death rate in China was 2.3%, but much higher death rates were seen in at-risk groups like those older than 80 years (15%) and 10.5% for those with cardiovascular disease.\n\nWho is most at risk?\n\nPeople older than 60 years of age are at increased risk of serious illness from COVID-19, explained Nancy Messonnier, MD, the director of CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases in a recent press briefing. People older than 80 have the highest risk of serious illness and death. Only 2% of the cases in the study from China occurred among children. People with underlying conditions such as high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer or diabetes, also have elevated risks, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nWhat causes COVID-19?\n\nOn Dec. 31, the WHO was notified of a cluster of unusual pneumonia cases in Wuhan City in China. A week later, Chinese authorities identified SARS-CoV-2 as the new coronavirus causing the infections, according to the WHO. It has quickly spread around the globe, with hundreds of thousands of confirmed infections and thousands of deaths.\n\nWhat are coronaviruses?\n\nCoronaviruses sometimes cross over from animals to humans. In some cases, these coronavirus crossovers begin spreading among humans and a few have caused serious respiratory illnesses. In 2002, a coronavirus that jumped from civet cats to humans caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), according to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). A decade later, a coronavirus that crossed from dromedary camels to humans caused the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) outbreak. SAR-CoV disappeared by 2004, though MERS-CoV continues to circulate in camels, according to NIAID. The exact source of the currently circulating novel coronavirus is unknown, but a recent genetic analysis suggests it is most closely related to coronaviruses circulating in bats.\n\nWhy is SARS-CoV-2 so dangerous?\n\nBecause humans have never been exposed to this new coronavirus before, they have essentially no immunity, Dr. Messioner said at the press briefing. As a result, it has spread exponentially, with thousands of cases reported across all 50 states by mid-March.\n\n“This virus is capable of spreading easily and sustainably from person-to-person based on the available data,” she said at the briefing. Small droplets from the nose or mouth of an infected person can infect others when they breathe in the droplets or touch surfaces the droplets have landed on and then touch their face, according to the WHO. People without symptoms may also spread the virus, the CDC notes, accounting for the recommendations some officials are making to drastically curb social interaction.\n\nWhy are we seeing strict public health measures in response to COVID-19?\n\nBecause the virus is so infectious and is spreading at exponential rates, public health authorities are concerned that the demand for care for people who become seriously ill could quickly overwhelm the healthcare system. To help prevent this, the CDC and the federal government are working with state and local authorities on strict public health measures to slow the spread of the virus such as recommending that people avoid social gatherings with more than 10 people and suggesting that those who are not employed in critical industries work from home if they can. In some areas, officials have required bars and restaurants to close and for residents, with some exceptions, to stay home. The idea is to “flatten the curve” – to slow the rate of new infections in the population – so that fewer people become sick at once and hospitals can keep up.\n\nAre people who acquire SARS-CoV-2 immune after they recover?\n\nSo far, there are limited data available on whether people who have been infected develop immunity or if they can become reinfected. But during his testimony to Congress, NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, MD ‘66, said, “if this acts like any other virus once you recover, you won’t get reinfected.”\n\nHow is COVID-19 treated?\n\nThere are currently no specific drugs to treat COVID-19, so doctors are relying on supportive care to help patients recover, according to the WHO. There are also no vaccines currently available that would protect people from becoming infected. But clinical trials are underway to test potential treatments and vaccines, though they are likely months away from being widely available. For example, clinical trials are underway in China of a drug called remdesivir, which was developed to treat MERS-CoV, according to NIAID, and manufacturer Gilead will provide the drug outside of the trials for certain severely ill patients, pregnant women and children, STAT News reported.\n\nClinical studies are also underway to see whether chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, drugs currently used to treat malaria and rheumatoid arthritis, or a drug called sarilumab, a drug that might reduce the lung inflammation, are safe and effective against COVID-19, according to the FDA. Some scientists, however, have urged caution about the potential use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine outside of clinical trials until data about their efficacy is confirmed. As of March 20th, the American Society of Health System Pharmacists were reporting shortages of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, potentially putting at risk patients in need of these drugs for established diseases.\n\nThe National Institutes of Health has also launched an early clinical trial of a vaccine to protect against COVID-19. “Finding a safe and effective vaccine to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2 is an urgent public health priority,” said Dr. Fauci in the announcement about the vaccine trial.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nClinical trials began to test potential treatments and vaccines for COVID-19.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA. The healthcare system shifted attention to COVID-19 patients, disrupting services for other medical conditions and resulting in many deaths.\nB. COVID-19 triggered a financial-market meltdown.\nC. The Iranian government issued an intercity travel ban and closed schools, universities, national parks, and non-essential businesses on March 26.\nD. Chinese authorities identified SARS-CoV-2 as the new coronavirus.\n\n/You MUST answer based strictly on the instructions:\n### INSTRUCTIONS:\nBased solely on the provided CONTEXT, evaluate each option for the TARGET EVENT.

No Russian general was seen going so close to danger.\n\nPrigozhin claimed his troops were being starved of ammunition by another of Putin’s trusted inner circle, Russia’s Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu.\n\nThe Wagner boss’s obvious hatred of Shoigu had developed into a festering turf war over who would control Wagner. At stake were the vast money-making ventures Prigozhin developed and owned for the Kremlin in Africa and beyond.\n\nPutin, whose hitherto iron-fisted rule relies on manipulating his inner circle’s interests to keep them in line, should have shut the feud down sooner.\n\nWhat the Russian public was hearing from Prigozhin, about how badly the war was going, was dangerous for Putin. The renegade mercenary boss’s regular diatribes about a screwed-up, lying military leadership were seeds of dissent falling on fertile soil.\n\nPrigozhin’s miscalculation was how fertile that soil was, or more specifically which bits weren’t.\n\nNot only had his message been gaining traction with the public, he’d also been drawing support from top military ranks. At the end of April, he recruited Deputy Defense Minister Mikhail Mizintsev direct from the Kremlin.\n\nAnother top defense official, Sergey Surovkin, who for a while last year was put in charge of Russia’s war in Ukraine, was a favorite of Prigozhin. “This is the only person with the star of the General of the Army who knows how to fight,” Prigozhin said, at the height of his spat with the defense ministry in Moscow.\n\nRumors were the respect was reciprocated.\n\nAround the same time Putin’s massively powerful and vital ally Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov heaped praise on Prigozhin’s troops. “The Wagner PMC has very good, courageous, necessary, necessary people,” Kadyrov said.\n\nAs Prigozhin threatened to pull his forces from the front lines Kadyrov was trying to mediate. “If you stay with us,” Kadyrov said, “I promise you that we will give you more, create better conditions, than you have today. We will try to make everything top notch for you.”\n\nAt 9 p.m. Friday night, Prigozhin claimed he met with Shoigu. What they discussed is still unknown. Shoigu left abruptly. Hours later, Prigozhin said he wasn’t budging till Shoigu came back to talk, and in the meantime said he had dispatched a fighting force to Moscow.\n\n## ‘Treacherous’ Prigozhin\n\nLate Saturday morning, as Prigozhin was still holed up in the Russian military headquarters in Rostov-on-Don, Kadyrov played kingmakers’ hand: “What is happening is not an ultimatum to the Ministry of Defense. This is a challenge to the state, and against this challenge it is necessary to rally around the national leader,” he declared.\n\nHe called Prigozhin “treacherous” and said he was sending his special forces to rout the mercenary boss. The walls were closing in.\n\nAny thought Prigozhin might rally Russian army generals to his cause was evaporating too. Hours earlier, Surovkin, the only general he valued, released a video message telling him to “stop” and to “obey the will” of President Vladimir Putin.\n\nFacing a potential Alamo, Prigozhin appeared to negotiate his way out on Saturday afternoon – or at least, he thought he did.\n\nPrigozhin claimed he called off his march on Moscow to save “Russian blood,” but the reality was that his neck was on the line.\n\nPutin, fabled for rewarding loyalty and punishing the disloyal, had only hours earlier accused Prigozhin of “treason” and “armed rebellion.” Now, he hid behind a diplomatic fig leaf, allowing his weak Belarus neighbor and supplicant, President Alexander Lukashenko, to announce an amnesty and sanctuary for Prigozhin.\n\nBut by Monday, that amnesty appeared to have evaporated. Russian state media said charges against Prigozhin had not been dropped, and since Belarus is an enfeebled client of Russia, it can surely offer little safety for Prigozhin.\n\nIf the Wagner boss does have any leverage left, it is bundled up in his shady diamond, gold and other dealings with Kremlin clients he helped recruit in Mali, Central African Republic, Sudan and Libya.\n\nSuch currency rarely holds its value long.\n\nPrigozhin’s world is a much smaller and more dangerous place now, but there can be little satisfaction for Putin in this as his empire is the most fragile it’s been since he consolidated his power from a wholly different group of oligarchs two decades ago.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nPrigozhin went into exile in Belarus.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

How will he eventually go? Who is likely to succeed him? Surely a dictator so surrounded by sycophantic generals, spies and secret policemen could ward off any serious threat? There was no one obvious to lead a move to throw him out. Anyway, his successor might be even worse. The broad conclusion was that he could be with us for a long time.\n\nThese were always fragile arguments. No dictator foresees the coup that overthrows him. No one can follow all the intrigues from outside. All politicians eventually lose their political instincts. It took Mrs Thatcher thirteen years. Putin has been there nearly twice as long- and his position has become increasingly brittle.\n\nWhen he moved centre stage as president in 2000, Putin promised the Russians prosperity, stability and the restoration of their self-respect after the chaotic poverty and humiliation of the Yeltsin years. His innate political cunning was accompanied by good fortune. High oil prices gave him the money to meet most of his popular promises. People turned a blind eye to his brutal rule and the corruption of his associates.\n\nBut he became obsessed with Ukraine. Like many of his countrymen, he resented the way it had detached itself from Russia after what they saw as centuries of intimate partnership, and he was determined to do something about it. He began by interfering directly with Ukrainian domestic politics in order to increase his own influence and reduce that of the West. Next, by means of a rather well-executed coup de main, he annexed Crimea to Russia, claiming that Ukraine had acquired it illegally as the result of an irresponsible political gesture by the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev six decades earlier. Then, scarcely bothering to hide what he was doing, he gave military and political support to the rebels fighting to bring Eastern Ukraine into Russia.\n\nFinally, he launched a full-scale invasion, on the pretext that Ukrainian fascists had already begun a war with the help of the West, designed to destroy the thousand-year-old Russian state. He evidently thought that could quickly reduce Ukraine to a vassal or take it over entirely. The Ukrainians surprised him, the West, and perhaps even themselves by the courageous ingenuity of their resistance.\n\nPutin tried to compensate for military failure by a burst of patriotic hysteria. He then made a further massive misjudgement. No dictator in his right mind allows a subordinate to build an independent military force. But, as he ran short of Russian regular and conscript soldiers, he farmed out part of the battle to a crony from the lower depths of St Petersburg, Yevgeny Prigozhin, who contributed his own army of convicts sprung from the prisons of Russia. They were fairly effective and grotesquely brutal, but they were unable to break the Ukrainians.\n\nPrigozhin was scornful of the incompetent way the Russian military had managed the initial stages of the war. He was deeply resentful of their attempts to gain control over him. He claimed that they were deliberately starving his men of weapons and ammunition. The war, he went on to trumpet, was nothing to do with Ukrainian Fascists: it was simply a get-rich-quick scheme devised by greedy and ambitious generals for their own benefit. This was already a serious swipe at Putin. But on 23 June Prigozhin tipped over into armed rebellion. He and his men put tanks on the streets of Rostov-on-Don, the logistics and communications hub for the Russian army in Ukraine, and took over the military headquarters there. He demanded that the military leadership come to him: otherwise he would go to Moscow to get them himself. He claimed it was not a coup, but a demand for justice.\n\nAt first Putin appears to have tried force. There are stories that Prigozhin’s men were bombarded by missiles and attacked by helicopters. But he failed to clip Prigozhin’s wings. He then accused Prigozhin on television of betraying his country and his people in their time of need, and called for his arrest. He drew a remarkably inept parallel with the events of 1917 – it’s not clear whether he was referring to the mutinies that brought down the Tsar in February оr the march on the capital by a rebellious general in August. Either way, people’s blood must have run cold as they remembered the horrors which followed that disastrous year.\n\nPutin’s ministers and generals, his spies and his policemen, rallied round him, at least in public. So did thugs, such as Ramzan Kadyrov, who has ruled Chechnya since Putin pounded it into submission. The authorities dug up the roads to Moscow as Prigozhin and his soldiers approached. Abandoning his threat to prosecute the traitor, Putin got his crony, the Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko, to negotiate a deal. Saying he wanted to avoid bloodshed, Prigozhin marched his men back down the hill. It’s not yet clear where they will end up, or who will pay for them when they get there. But as they left Rostov they were cheered on the streets.\n\nPrigozhin bottled out and made a fool of himself. But Putin’s weakness has been shown up and his authority diminished. Much of the detail is still murky. The right-wing extremists who used to support Prigozhin are still around. We don’t know what the soldiers in the field or the wretched Russian people really think or how they will finally jump. We still have no idea how or when Putin will go, or who will succeed him. But the end of the Putin era is surely heaving into sight.\n\nMeanwhile, Moscow has a war to fight.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nPrigozhin negotiated his exit and called off his march on Moscow on Saturday afternoon.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

No Russian general was seen going so close to danger.\n\nPrigozhin claimed his troops were being starved of ammunition by another of Putin’s trusted inner circle, Russia’s Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu.\n\nThe Wagner boss’s obvious hatred of Shoigu had developed into a festering turf war over who would control Wagner. At stake were the vast money-making ventures Prigozhin developed and owned for the Kremlin in Africa and beyond.\n\nPutin, whose hitherto iron-fisted rule relies on manipulating his inner circle’s interests to keep them in line, should have shut the feud down sooner.\n\nWhat the Russian public was hearing from Prigozhin, about how badly the war was going, was dangerous for Putin. The renegade mercenary boss’s regular diatribes about a screwed-up, lying military leadership were seeds of dissent falling on fertile soil.\n\nPrigozhin’s miscalculation was how fertile that soil was, or more specifically which bits weren’t.\n\nNot only had his message been gaining traction with the public, he’d also been drawing support from top military ranks. At the end of April, he recruited Deputy Defense Minister Mikhail Mizintsev direct from the Kremlin.\n\nAnother top defense official, Sergey Surovkin, who for a while last year was put in charge of Russia’s war in Ukraine, was a favorite of Prigozhin. “This is the only person with the star of the General of the Army who knows how to fight,” Prigozhin said, at the height of his spat with the defense ministry in Moscow.\n\nRumors were the respect was reciprocated.\n\nAround the same time Putin’s massively powerful and vital ally Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov heaped praise on Prigozhin’s troops. “The Wagner PMC has very good, courageous, necessary, necessary people,” Kadyrov said.\n\nAs Prigozhin threatened to pull his forces from the front lines Kadyrov was trying to mediate. “If you stay with us,” Kadyrov said, “I promise you that we will give you more, create better conditions, than you have today. We will try to make everything top notch for you.”\n\nAt 9 p.m. Friday night, Prigozhin claimed he met with Shoigu. What they discussed is still unknown. Shoigu left abruptly. Hours later, Prigozhin said he wasn’t budging till Shoigu came back to talk, and in the meantime said he had dispatched a fighting force to Moscow.\n\n## ‘Treacherous’ Prigozhin\n\nLate Saturday morning, as Prigozhin was still holed up in the Russian military headquarters in Rostov-on-Don, Kadyrov played kingmakers’ hand: “What is happening is not an ultimatum to the Ministry of Defense. This is a challenge to the state, and against this challenge it is necessary to rally around the national leader,” he declared.\n\nHe called Prigozhin “treacherous” and said he was sending his special forces to rout the mercenary boss. The walls were closing in.\n\nAny thought Prigozhin might rally Russian army generals to his cause was evaporating too. Hours earlier, Surovkin, the only general he valued, released a video message telling him to “stop” and to “obey the will” of President Vladimir Putin.\n\nFacing a potential Alamo, Prigozhin appeared to negotiate his way out on Saturday afternoon – or at least, he thought he did.\n\nPrigozhin claimed he called off his march on Moscow to save “Russian blood,” but the reality was that his neck was on the line.\n\nPutin, fabled for rewarding loyalty and punishing the disloyal, had only hours earlier accused Prigozhin of “treason” and “armed rebellion.” Now, he hid behind a diplomatic fig leaf, allowing his weak Belarus neighbor and supplicant, President Alexander Lukashenko, to announce an amnesty and sanctuary for Prigozhin.\n\nBut by Monday, that amnesty appeared to have evaporated.

They’re also a mere preview of what climate change has in store\nContent: CNN —\n\nEntire towns have been burned to the ground.\n\nThousands have been forced to flee their homes.\n\nAnd apocalyptic scenes played out in San Francisco, as the city was blanketed in smoke so thick it blocked out the sun.\n\nThe scale of the fires burning in the Western US right now are unprecedented.\n\nMore than 3 million acres have burned in California alone, with three of the five largest fires in state history still burning all at once, along with huge swaths of Oregon and Washington. Still, much of the West is only now entering what is typically the most active part of the region’s fire season.\n\nTo scientists, the fingerprints of global warming on these wildfires – and so many other disasters, from the fires that scorched Australia to the hurricanes that have slammed the US – are clear.\n\nIn this aerial view from a drone, a mobile home park destroyed by fire is shown on September 10, 2020 in Phoenix, Oregon. Hundreds of homes in the town have been lost due to wildfire. David Ryder/Getty Images\n\nAnd as devastating as they have been, far worse disasters could be on the horizon.\n\nHow bad it gets depends on what we as humans do to reduce heat-trapping gas emissions, said Michael Mann, the director of Penn State University’s Earth System Science Center.\n\n“By some measure, it’s clear that ‘dangerous climate change’ has already arrived,” Mann said in response to emailed questions from CNN. “It’s a matter of how bad we’re willing to let it get.”\n\nHow climate change influences wildfires\n\nThough the scale of destruction is hard to fathom, climate scientists say we should not be surprised.\n\n“It’s shocking to see the impacts, but not scientifically surprising,” Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at UCLA and the National Center for Atmospheric Research told CNN on Tuesday. “This is in line with essentially every prediction for what could happen this year and the trends we’re seeing over years and decades.”\n\nA burned residence smolders during the Bear fire, part of the North Lightning Complex fires, in unincorporated Butte County, California on September 9, 2020. JOSH EDELSON/AFP/AFP via Getty Images\n\nScientists have warned for years that fire seasons like this could come to pass, and that the more we humans heat up the planet, the more we are increasing the odds in favor of the hot, dry conditions conducive to fires.\n\nSo far, the planet has warmed by a global average of roughly 1.2 degrees Celsius since the 1880s, with human activity responsible for the bulk of that increase.\n\nThis warming is clear in long-term temperature graphs for the state of California, such as this one below from the nonprofit environmental monitoring organization Berkeley Earth, which shows that August temperatures in the state have climbed steadily over the last 150 years.\n\nThis past August was the warmest on record for the state of California, according to NOAA, and each of the past six years were at least 1 to 2 degrees Celsius (1.8 to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than the historical average.\n\n“That couple of degrees of [average] warming over decades … you don’t notice it as much, but it’s still there lurking in the background, sucking extra moisture out of the vegetation and the soil,” Swain said.\n\nAccording to the National Climate Assessment, a major “state-of-science” review of climate change and its projected impacts on the US, additional warming of about 1.4 degrees Celsius (2.5 degrees Fahrenheit) can be expected over the next few decades regardless of future emissions.\n\nBy the second half of the century, the uncertainty range for the amount of warming grows tremendously, as so much will depend on potential cut backs in carbon emissions in the near future.\n\nThe future depends on ‘what we choose to do’\n\nLockdowns and shelter-in-place orders during the Covid-19 pandemic did result in the largest drop in greenhouse gas emissions in recorded human history.\n\nBut scientists expect the reductions will be temporary, and the policies that brought emissions down – i.e. forcing people to stay home – are not sustainable.\n\nAnd despite the brief dip in heat-trapping gas emissions, atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations are still the highest they’ve been in at least 800,000 years.\n\nScientists say the impacts of climate change are growing worse before our very eyes.\n\n“If you’re in California, or on the Gulf Coast, or in Puerto Rico, Texas, the Carolinas, or Iowa, you’ve seen the devastating consequences of climate change already,” Mann said.\n\nStill, he says there is time left to flatten the curve of global warming impacts, but the longer we wait, the steeper that curve gets.\n\n“So much depends on what we choose to do,” Mann said. “If we keep planetary warming below 1.5 Celsius, which is still possible given concerted climate action, we can keep climate change impacts within our adaptive capacity. If we don’t, we will likely exceed it.”\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nAir quality along the West Coast deteriorated to harmful levels, with Portland registering the worst air globally and Seattle the third worst.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

That process could take at least two years.\n\nBoris Johnson, the former mayor of London who campaigned for the UK’s departure from the EU, is tipped by bookmakers as Cameron’s likely successor.\n\nJohnson, who was greeted by a booing crowd when he left his home on Friday morning, thanked voters for their decision, pledged that the UK would remain committed to Europe and urged unity.\n\n“I think the electorate have searched in their hearts and answered as honestly as they can,” he said. “They have decided to vote to take back control from a European Union that has become too remote.”\n\nFormer PM: There will be costs\n\nFormer British Prime Minister Tony Blair told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer that UK voters would learn over the next 24 months that leaving Europe will not solve their economic troubles, ease their apprehensions or make Britain more independent in a meaningful way.\n\n“I literally cannot think of a big decision that I was not able to take because of Europe,” Blair said. “There is so much anger at the moment that the anger replaces the more rational answers.”\n\nBlair noted that the United States was facing the same type of political fracturing, brought on by economic turmoil, globalization and anger at immigration.\n\n“Getting out of Europe is not the answer,” he said, noting the UK sells half of its goods and services to the EU. “We are going to have to negotiate ourselves back into that market and it will be much more difficult than these people understand.”\n\nPossible Scottish independence vote\n\nIn Scotland, where support was overwhelmingly in favor of remaining in the EU, Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s First Minister and leader of the dominant Scottish National Party, said the outcome threw into doubt the future of her country’s place in the UK.\n\nShe said the Scottish government will begin preparing legislation for a new independence referendum if the Scottish Parliament decides it wants to hold one. Scots voted down a bid for independence from the UK in 2014.\n\n“Democratically unacceptable,” said Sturgeon in describing the fact that Scotland would be pulled out of the European Union despite the majority of the Scottish people voting to stay in.\n\nMORE: What does Brexit mean for you?\n\nSinn Fein calls for Irish unity\n\nThe Sinn Féin party in Northern Ireland called for a referendum on Irish unity, which could take Northern Ireland out of the UK and join it with the Republic of Ireland, an EU member.\n\nVoters in Northern Ireland voted for the UK to remain in the EU.\n\nSinn Féin President Gerry Adams said the Brexit result could portend tougher border rules – with barriers and custom posts – between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, because it will be the only land border between the EU and the UK.\n\nAdams said such a result would be unacceptable given the vote result in Northern Ireland and could undermine the cooperative relationships and that have developed between the two Irelands since the Good Friday agreement.\n\n“My issue is the north of Ireland is going to be dragged out of the EU on the decision made by people on another island,” said Adams, whose political party is dedicated to the reunification of Ireland.\n\n“We’re calling for a poll, a referendum, on Irish unity, on the border. This (the Brexit vote) has the potential to set back the good work that’s been done in terms of the peace process, building harmony, building infrastructure.”\n\n‘Dying’ institution\n\nAs European leaders faced their own crises, German Chancellor Angela Merkel stressed the “need to make sure that European people feel that the EU wants to improve all our lives.”\n\nShe said she greatly regretted the UK’s decision, but added, “The EU is strong enough to find the right answers today.”\n\nFrench President Francois Hollande called it a “painful choice which I deeply regret for the UK and Europe.”\n\nItaly’s finance minister, Pier Carlo Padoan, warned of a domino effect amid calls for further exit votes.\n\nFar-right Dutch politician Geert Wilders congratulated the UK on its decision and called for a Dutch referendum on EU membership.\n\n“We want to be in charge of our own country, our own money, our own borders and our own immigration policy,” he was quoted as saying in a statement on his website.\n\nMarine Le Pen, the leader of France’s National Front party who plans to run for the French presidency next year, also congratulated the Brexit side.\n\nHer party has suggested the French will also hold an “out” referendum if she assumes the presidency.\n\nPassions continued to run high in the UK in the hours after the vote, with UK Independence Party (UKIP) leader and Leave campaigner Nigel Farage declaring the EU a “dying” institution.\n\n“We’ve given ourselves the chance to rejoin the world,” he told journalists. “June 23rd needs to become a national bank holiday and we will call it Independence Day.”\n\nU.S. President Barack Obama said that while the UK’s relationship with Europe was changing, the ties that bound the UK to the United States and the United States to Europe would remain.\n\n“I do think yesterday’s vote speaks to ongoing changes and challenges that are raised by globalization, but the UK’s relationship with the EU will change. What will not change is the special relationship that exists between our two nations,” Obama said. “That will endure. And the EU will remain one of our indispensable partners.”\n\nMORE: Full coverage of the UK referendum\n\nNATO: UK will stay a strong ally\n\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg voiced reassurances that the United Kingdom will remain a strong and committed NATO ally despite the vote.\n\n“Today, as we face more instability and uncertainty, NATO is more important than ever as a platform for cooperation among European allies and between Europe and North America,” said Stoltenberg. “A strong, united and determined NATO remains an essential pillar of stability in a turbulent world and a key contributor to international peace and security.”\n\nVoters react\n\nThe referendum followed one of the most divisive political campaigns in recent memory. Polls consistently showed voters split down the middle, with the outcome too close to call ahead of the vote.\n\nNews of the decision sparked strong emotions, with those in favor and those against reflecting on a campaign marred by allegations of lies, distrust and hate.\n\n“This is so sad,” said Daniel Trilling on Twitter. “Millions of people aren’t going to feel any more in control of their lives or their country because of this vote.”\n\n“People vote on emotion,” Twitter user @cemanthe posted. “This was won on false promises and emotive texts about immigration. Not on facts.”\n\n“I am SO happy this morning,” wrote another, Gemma.\n\nAn online petition calling for a second referendum gathered more than 120,000 signatures within hours of being posted.\n\nLeading political figures gave mixed reactions.\n\nTony Blair, the former UK prime minister, called the decision a divided result.\n\n“It’s going to be a complicated process but it’s important to bring our country together and stabilize our country,” he told CNN’s Becky Anderson. “It’s still a resilient country and it’s a strong country.”\n\nSadiq Khan, the mayor of largely pro-EU London, said the decision was a “clear message” and urged calm.\n\n‘Taking back control’\n\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk said the decision was “historic, but not a moment for hysterical reactions.”\n\nDonald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee in the U.S. presidential election, hailed the UK’s decision to “reassert control over their own politics, borders and economy.”\n\nIn a news conference Friday as he attended the official opening of a remodeled golf resort bearing his name in Turnberry, Scotland, Trump called the decision of the voters “a great thing.”\n\n“They’re angry over borders, they’re angry over people coming into the country and taking over. Nobody even knows who they are,” he said. “They’re angry about many, many things.

The popular district in Seoul was hosting Halloween celebrations that drew around 100,000 people when the crowd surge began. Many were attempting to gather in a narrow alley filled with bars and restaurants, according to local media.\n\nVideos have popped up online showing the sheer mass of people crowded into at least one tight street lined with bars and restaurants. Some people can be heard screaming, and most appear completely unable to move.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nOne worker at an Itaewon club, located at the uphill end of the roughly 11-foot-wide alley leading to the district's main street, recalled to reporters seeing the crowd of revelers surge on Saturday night.\n\n\"We could hear some people in the crowd saying, don't push, but someone in the back said, hey, push! Push! And people started screaming, and the crowd poured in toward our club,\" he said.\n\nThe man, who declined to give his name to reporters, said they would ordinarily not let minors into their club, but they opened their doors to try to save lives.\n\n\"But even after we did that, there were people collapsed at the entrance, and some passed out,\" he added. \"We tried to rescue them, but our club was at the end of the surge and there were already three or four layers of people piled on, so we couldn't.\"\n\nHe said his inability to help people \"keeps haunting me, and pains me.\"\n\nOther videos shared on social media show several people, some clad in their Halloween costumes, attempting CPR on rows of victims unconscious on sidewalks.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Chung Sung-Jun/Getty Images Chung Sung-Jun/Getty Images\n\nSurvivors struggle to locate friends\n\nMost of the dead had been identified by mid-morning on Sunday. The task was simplified by the fact that Korean citizens over the age of 17 are required to submit fingerprints to authorities.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nKoreans and foreign nationals who are missing friends and relatives came to a nearby community center to try to identify pictures of the victims.\n\nPark Kang-hyun, 26, traveled to Seoul from Gwangju city, in the country's southwest, in search of two missing friends. One lost her cell phone but survived, he said. The other remains missing.\n\nThe friend who survived said \"there were just too many people. They didn't even have a moment to feel scared. Everyone just fell down.\"\n\nHe continued to search for his other friend, but city officials \"just told me to wait. There's nothing we can do now.\"\n\nNathan Taverniti, 24, was on vacation from Australia. He told reporters he was in Itaewon with three friends.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Chung Sung-Jun/Getty Images Chung Sung-Jun/Getty Images\n\n\"I was there the whole night. Some people fell in front of me, and I lost a group of my friends,\" he said. \"Somehow, I got out, but all three of my friends ... two are in hospital, and one has passed away,\" he said, fighting back tears.\n\n\"There was no police. There was nobody to help me,\" he said. \"It was just me and other bystanders. And I couldn't do anything.\"\n\nIn the aftermath of the crowd surge, questions have begun to surface over whether more police should've been dispatched to the area to help control the large crowds. The Korea Herald reports that emergency crews nearby had trouble getting to the scene and to the hundreds of victims given the crowds and added traffic congestion.\n\nInterior Minister Lee Sang-min has pushed back against the idea more could've been done to prevent the tragedy, according to The Korea Herald. The outlet quotes Lee saying that the crush did not seem to be \"an incident that could have been prevented by deploying more police or fire officers.\"\n\nThe Halloween event had been held before and according to local media reports there was no concern that crowds would be a particular problem this year or any larger than previous events had been.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nTwo Americans are among the dead\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Lee Jin-man/AP Lee Jin-man/AP\n\nAt least two U.S. citizens were among those killed in the deadly crowd surge, the U.S. embassy in Seoul has confirmed.\n\n\"I am deeply saddened by the loss of so many lives last night, to include two young Americans celebrating alongside their Korean friends and others from around the world,\" U.S. Ambassador to the Republic of Korea Philip Goldberg said in a statement.\n\nIn a statement on Twitter, President Biden also offered his condolences.\n\n\"Jill and I are devastated to learn that at least two Americans are among so many who lost their lives in Seoul. Our hearts go out to their loved ones in this time of grief, and we continue to pray for the recovery of all who were injured,\" the president said.\n\nOne of those individuals who died was University of Kentucky student Anne Gieske, the school announced Sunday. Gieske was a junior nursing student from Northern Kentucky who was studying in South Korea as part of an education abroad program.\n\nTwo other students and a faculty member, who are also in South Korea for the semester, were contacted and are confirmed to be safe, the university said.\n\n\"We will be there for those in our community who knew and loved Anne. We also have nearly 80 students from South Korea at UK — members of our community — who will need our support,\" Eli Capilouto, the university's president said in a statement to the school community.\n\nAs of 9 p.m. Sunday local time, officials say at least 26 foreign nationals were killed in the incident, according to local media reports.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Seoul is working with local authorities and providing consular assistance to any U.S. citizens affected, a spokesman told NPR.\n\nIn response to the tragedy, South Korea Prime Minister Han Duck-soo announced a period of national mourning to last until midnight on Nov. 5.\n\nThe government has declared Seoul's Yongsan district, where Itaewon is located, a special disaster area.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert at causal reasoning."}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n### CONTEXT\n[Doc 1]\nTitle: August 22, 2021\nContent: A week after the Taliban took control of Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, as the U.S. was withdrawing the forces that have been in the country since 2001, the initial chaos created by the Taliban’s rapid sweep across the country has simmered down into what is at least a temporary pattern.\n\nWe knew there was a good chance that the Taliban would regain control of the country when we left, although that was not a foregone conclusion. The former president, Donald Trump, recognized that the American people were tired of the ongoing war in Afghanistan, which was approaching its 20th year, and in February 2020, his administration negotiated with the Taliban to enable the U.S. to withdraw. In exchange for the release of 5000 Taliban fighters and the promise that the U.S. would withdraw within the next 14 months, the Taliban agreed not to attack U.S. soldiers.\n\nTrump’s dislike of the war in Afghanistan reflected the unpopularity of the long engagement, which by 2020 was ill defined. The war had begun in 2001, after terrorists affiliated with al-Qaeda attacked the United States on September 11 of that year. Taliban leaders in control of Afghanistan sheltered al-Qaeda, and after the attacks, the U.S. president, George W. Bush, demanded that Afghanistan hand over the terrorist leader believed to be behind the terrorist attack on the U.S: Osama bin Laden. In October, after Taliban leaders refused, the U.S. launched a bombing campaign.\n\nThat campaign was successful enough that in December 2001 the Taliban offered to surrender. But the U.S. rejected that surrender, determined by then to eradicate the extremist group and fill the vacuum of its collapse with a new, pro-American government. Al-Qaeda leader bin Laden escaped from Afghanistan to Pakistan, and the U.S. project in Afghanistan turned from an anti-terrorism mission into an effort to rebuild the Afghan government into a modern democracy.\n\nBy 2002 the Bush administration was articulating a new doctrine in foreign policy, arguing that the U.S. had a right to strike preemptively against countries that harbor terrorists. In 2003, under this doctrine, the U.S. launched a war on Iraq, which diverted money, troops, and attention from Afghanistan. The Taliban regrouped and began to regain the territory it had lost after the U.S. first began its bombing campaign in 2001.\n\nBy 2005, Bush administration officials privately worried the war in Afghanistan could not be won on its current terms, especially with the U.S. focused on Iraq. Then, when he took office in 2009, President Barack Obama turned his attention back to Afghanistan. He threw more troops into that country, bringing their numbers close to 100,000. In 2011, the U.S. military located bin Laden in Abbottabad, Pakistan, and launched a raid on the compound where he was hiding, killing him. By 2014, Obama had drawn troops in Afghanistan down to about 11,000, and in December of that year, he announced that the mission of the war—weakening the Taliban and capturing bin Laden—had been accomplished, and thus the war was over. The troops would come home.\n\nBut, of course, they didn’t, leaving Trump to develop his own policy. But his administration’s approach to the chaos in that country was different than his predecessor’s. By negotiating with the Taliban and excluding the Afghan government the U.S. had been supporting, the Trump team essentially accepted that the Taliban were the most important party in Afghanistan. The agreement itself reflected the oddity of the negotiations. Each clause referring to the Taliban began: “The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan which is not recognized by the United States as a state and is known as the Taliban will….”\n\nIt was immediately clear that the Taliban was not living up to its side of the bargain. Although it did stop attacking U.S. troops, It began to escalate violence in Afghanistan itself, assassinated political opponents, and maintained ties to al-Qaeda. Nonetheless, the Trump administration put pressure on the leaders of the Afghan government to release the 5000 Taliban prisoners, and they eventually did. Before Biden took office, Trump dropped the U.S. troop engagement in Afghanistan from about 13,000 to about 2500.\n\nWhen he took office, Biden had to decide whether to follow Trump’s path or to push back on the Taliban on the grounds they were not honoring the agreement Trump’s people had hammered out. Biden himself wanted to get out of the war. At the same time, he recognized that fighting the Taliban again would mean throwing more troops back into Afghanistan, and that the U.S. would again begin to take casualties. He opted to get the troops out, but extended the deadline to September 11, 2021, the twentieth anniversary of the initial attack. (Former president Trump complained that the troops should come out faster.)\n\nWhat Biden did not foresee was the speed with which the Taliban would retake control of the country. It swept over the regional capitals and then Kabul in about nine days in mid-August with barely a shot fired, and the head of the Afghan government fled the country, leaving it in chaos.\n\nThat speed left the U.S. flatfooted. Afghans who had been part of the government or who had helped the U.S. and its allies rushed to the airport to try to escape. In the pandemonium of that first day, up to seven people were killed; two people appear to have clung to a U.S. military plane as it took off, falling to their deaths.\n\nAnd yet, the Taliban, so far, has promised amnesty for its former opponents and limited rights for women. It has its own problems, as the Afghan government has been supported for the previous 20 years by foreign money, including a large percentage from the U.S. Not only has that money dried up as foreign countries refuse to back the Taliban, but also Biden has put sanctions on Afghanistan and also on some Pakistanis suspected of funding the Taliban. At the same time it appears that no other major sponsor, like Russia or China, has stepped in to fill the vacuum left by U.S. money, leaving the Taliban fishing for whatever goodwill it can find.\n\nYesterday, Josh Marshall of Talking Points Memo flagged tweets showing that members of the Afghan government, including the brother of the president who fled, are in what appear from the photos posted on Twitter to be relaxed talks about forming a new government. Other factions in Afghanistan would like to stop this from happening, and today Biden’s national security adviser Jake Sullivan warned that ISIS-K, another extremist group, is threatening to attack the airport to destabilize the Taliban.\n\nMeanwhile, there are 10,000 people crowded into that airport, and U.S. evacuations continue. The Kabul airport is secure—for now—and the U.S. military has created a larger perimeter around it for protection. The U.S. government has asked Americans in Afghanistan to shelter in place until they can be moved out safely; the Qatari ambassador to Afghanistan has been escorting groups of them to the airport. Evacuations have been slower than hoped because of backlogs at the next stage of the journey, but the government has enlisted the help of 18 commercial airlines to move those passengers forward, leaving room for new evacuees.\n\nYesterday, about 7800 evacuees left the Kabul airport. About 28,000 have been evacuated since August 14.\n\nInterestingly, much of the U.S. media is describing this scenario as a disaster for President Biden. Yet, on CNN this morning, Matthew Dowd, who was the chief strategist for the Bush-Cheney ticket in 2004, noted that more than 20,000 people have been evacuated from Afghanistan without a single loss of an American life, while in the same period of time, 5000 Americans have died from Covid-19 and 500 have died from gunshots.\n\n—-\n\nNotes:\n\nhttps://www.npr.org/2020/02/29/810537586/u-s-signs-peace-deal-with-taliban-after-nearly-2-decades-of-war-in-afghanistan\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2021/08/12/obama-afghan-war-ending-afghanistan-papers-book-excerpt/\n\nhttps://www.factcheck.org/2021/08/timeline-of-u-s-withdrawal-from-afghanistan/\n\nhttps://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/you-wouldnt-know-it-from-the-us-news-coverage-but\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/16/kabul-airport-chaos-and-panic-as-afghans-and-foreigners-attempt-to-flee-the-capital\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2021/08/22/afghanistan-biden-evacuations/\n\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2021/08/21/politics/kabul-airport-terror-warning/index.html\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/08/17/treasury-taliban-money-afghanistan/\n\nShare\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nThe Taliban began a massive offensive in early May 2021.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

I do not want to hear his name again, and I want it to disappear from the news. If that happens, hopefully this man who thrived on holding power over women will start feeling powerless. Worthless. Alone.\n\nWho I do care about is you, the ones who tweeted #MeToo. The women who have experienced the pain of feeling powerless, worthless and alone. Because you are the ones who deserve to be heard and have a voice louder than those who wish to silence it.\n\nWhat is #MeToo? Two small words — one big meaning — and a force across social media.\n\nIf you’ve been on Twitter or Facebook at all in the past few days and follow any of the millions of women who have used this hashtag, you know what I’m referring to. With a simple tweet on Sunday, Alyssa Milano started a firestorm when she asked that anyone who had been sexually harassed to reply with “me too.”\n\nWho’s the boss? Alyssa is.\n\nDifficult conversation about sexual harassment grows larger\n\nAlthough originally in response to Weinstein and the slew of similar sexual harassment reports now widespread across the news, #MeToo has quickly grown into a larger conversation, and it’s a difficult one. From those worried that the conversation could lead to witch hunts to women calling for fewer hashtags and more change, everyone seems to have joined the discussion.\n\nFor me, that alone is very worthwhile. Not that I feel warm and fuzzy seeing women come out en masse to share their horror stories — well, other than Mayim Bialik — I do have a strange sense of pride watching the story unfold, as women are being so open, bold and truthful.\n\nMaybe the truth can set us free?\n\nThat sounds so simplistic. Don’t get me wrong, I absolutely do not believe that the answer to a cultural change is that easy, but I do feel that it’s a start. There’s power in words, just as there is power in secrecy. If our culture starts talking about things that have, for so long, been closed-door conversations, is it possible that those conversations could reduce the frequency and acceptance of harassment? If women no longer feel that they have to be ashamed and bad conduct is not swept under the rug for fear of repercussions, would more voices be heard? And, if the women that come forward are given an active voice to describe the offense AND offender, rather than minimizing the situation as a women’s issue (see video above; thank you, Jackson Katz!), would they be less likely to hesitate?\n\nAt the same time that I ask these questions to you, I also ask them of myself. Would I be less afraid if society accepted open dialogue about sexual harassment and rape without implication of fault on the victim? Obviously, I would. Until that day when I can share my own stories of harassment — and even assault — I’ll just say this: #MeToo.\n\nLisha Dunlap Lisha Dunlap is a NonDoc commentator and freelance writer with a mass media degree from Washburn University.

I can’t find the words to describe my frustration,” said Kim Hyo-lim, 23, after the motion failed. “I am devastated, but I feel honored to be a part of this historic moment for my country.”\n\nAs the rally kicked off in the afternoon, the atmosphere was festive. Many parents brought along their young children.\n\nLee Soo-young, 38, pushed her 2-year-old son in a stroller. “I don’t want him to live in a country that could be under martial law again,” she said.\n\nOver the next few hours, the crowds swelled, even as night fell and the temperature dropped. Seoul’s subway operator closed three nearby stations, yet people continued to flow in, filling several blocks and intersections. Many people held candles or colorful light sticks. They carried blankets to bundle up against the temperatures, which have hovered near freezing all week. Chants and music could be heard from blocks away.\n\nOrganizers used Facebook to arrange cross-country transportation: shuttle buses from cities hours away from Seoul and even plane rides from Jeju, an island off the southern coast. On X, people shared names that protesters could give at nearby cafes to get free drinks.\n\nWhile most of the attention was on the crowds outside the National Assembly, in another part of Seoul, a much smaller group of Mr. Yoon’s supporters gathered in one of the city’s main plazas. Mr. Yoon’s low approval rating plunged further this week. But thousands of his supporters sang anthems and waved South Korean and U.S. flags on Saturday.\n\nDemonstrators there did not want to talk about the short-lived martial law. Instead, person after person criticized the leader of the main opposition party, Lee Jae-myung, calling him a communist, and said Mr. Yoon was protecting the country from communism and preserving its relationship with the United States.\n\nWhile the crowd supporting Mr. Yoon was predominantly older, outside the National Assembly, many were protesting for the first time.\n\nAmong them was An Ye-young, 19, who said her parents disagreed with her politically. “For many of us who don’t usually pay attention to politics, and have just turned old enough to vote, there’s been a wake-up call to become more aware,” she said.\n\nThe night martial law was imposed, Ms. An couldn’t sleep. She rewatched “A Taxi Driver,” the South Korean film about the uprising against martial law in Gwangju in May 1980. “When I saw the scenes where citizens raised their voices,” she said, “I thought I should go and protest.”\n\nChang W. Lee and Qasim Nauman contributed reporting from Seoul.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nPrime Minister Han Duck-soo became acting president.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Russian president Vladimir Putin gave a televised speech, calling Prigozhin a traitor who was “stabbing Russia in the back”.\n\nRussian president Vladimir Putin gave a televised speech calling Prigozhin a traitor. Picture: Getty Images\n\nIt seemed that a real coup attempt was underway and Putin’s leadership was in real jeopardy. But, within 24 hours, it was all over and much of the world was left scratching their heads. Prigozhin had secured a deal for himself and his troops were heading back to their camps. What happened?\n\nPolitics & Society How Putin is devising his exit plan\n\nThe Prigozhin affair was neither a serious coup nor challenge to President Vladimir Putin’s authority. It was instead Prigozhin’s attempt to secure his own position in his ongoing feud with the Minister for Defence, Sergei Shoigu. The whole thing reveals a much deeper truth about Putin’s Russia: the weakness of mechanisms for peacefully resolving high-level, intra-elite disputes. As the war in Ukraine drags on, this creates an increasingly dangerous situation for Putin and the stability of the Russian state.\n\nResolving elite disputes\n\nWhy are there no regularised mechanisms for resolving intra-elite disputes in modern Russia?\n\nHead of the Wagner Group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, leaving the Southern Military District headquarters in Rostov-on-Don. Picture: Getty Images\n\nRussia has strong similarities to the ‘dual state’ in Nazi Germany. In the German ‘prerogative’ state, disputes were resolved by Adolph Hitler and the Nazi Party through methods unchecked by any legal or institutional guarantees. In the ‘normative’ state, by contrast, courts resolved non-politically charged disputes according to the law. The dualist state had evolved to allow Hitler and the Nazi Party to exercise their unlimited prerogative power in high-level disputes. But in matters that did not directly involve high level, political interests, the old ‘normative’ state continued to operate.\n\nPolitics & Society Why the war in Ukraine is so hard to stop\n\nThe Nazi party needed this normative state to predictably and reasonably regulate commercial disputes; it is next to impossible to organise a large system of market capitalism where there is no underlying consensus and trust among stakeholders on the predictability of outcomes if these vary from case to case. Contemporary Russia has evolved in a similar direction. Putin and his supporters use the prerogative state to ensure that they have unchecked power to settle disputes that threaten their power. But, in other disputes that do not make the headlines or impact major political players, legal institutions still function. Political scientist Professor Peter Solomon writes that “the cases that matter [politically] represent a small minority of the total, and most cases are handled fairly and expeditiously”.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin with long-serving Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu. Picture: Getty Images\n\nThe prigozhin affair\n\nThe ‘Prigozhin affair’ grew out of an intensifying intra-elite feud between Prigozhin and the Minister for Defence, Sergei Shoigu. This kind of elite feuding is highly common in Putin’s Russia. In fact, elite splits enhance Putin’s power by decreasing the possibility of a strong challenge to his power and making him the ultimate arbiter.\n\nPolitics & Society The past is never in the past\n\nFor months, Prigozhin knew he could get away with this criticism because he was useful to the war effort. His contributions to the war – and particularly the role of his private military company Wagner in the capture of Bakhmut – gave him leverage that guaranteed his safety. But, in recent weeks, it appeared that he was losing this leverage. In the days before his ‘mutiny’, Prigozhin found out that his private military company (Wagner) would be absorbed into the Russian military. Rumours were also swirling around that Prigozhin would soon be arrested and put in jail. Seeing his position weakening, Prigozhin – a convicted criminal who served time in prison – understood the logic of the prerogative state. There were no regularised ways of defending his position.\n\nThe Russian army was caught off guard by the Wagner Group forces who seized a key Russian city. Picture: Getty Images\n\nThe best lawyers in Russia could not save him. Any criminal proceeding against him would be pre-determined and a mere formality before a very long jail sentence. In the end, the currency of the Russian prerogative state was force and power. He had to flex his power while he still had it. His march on Moscow was therefore not a coup meant to challenge Putin or topple the Russian state. In fact, his public statements carefully avoided criticising Putin. His actions were instead a way to protect his own interests. And they paid off.\n\nPolitics & Society Five things to know about Russia’s Constitutional amendments\n\nThe Russian army was caught off guard and his forces were able to seize a key Russian city (and military hub) in the south and begin to move toward Moscow. But throughout, all sides avoided serious confrontation; it looked like everyone understood what was happening. Prigozhin was manouvering for a deal. And he got one.\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\nThe ‘Prigozhin affair’ shows the changing nature of Russia’s dual state. Since the war started, the Russian prerogative state has expanded. This has advantaged Putin and his supporters by allowing them more space to crack down on opposition to the regime. Perhaps the best example is a blatantly unconstitutional law that has been used to punish thousands of Russians for criticising the war.\n\nIn this environment, intra-elite disputes are far more dangerous than they were before.

They’re also a mere preview of what climate change has in store\nContent: CNN —\n\nEntire towns have been burned to the ground.\n\nThousands have been forced to flee their homes.\n\nAnd apocalyptic scenes played out in San Francisco, as the city was blanketed in smoke so thick it blocked out the sun.\n\nThe scale of the fires burning in the Western US right now are unprecedented.\n\nMore than 3 million acres have burned in California alone, with three of the five largest fires in state history still burning all at once, along with huge swaths of Oregon and Washington. Still, much of the West is only now entering what is typically the most active part of the region’s fire season.\n\nTo scientists, the fingerprints of global warming on these wildfires – and so many other disasters, from the fires that scorched Australia to the hurricanes that have slammed the US – are clear.\n\nIn this aerial view from a drone, a mobile home park destroyed by fire is shown on September 10, 2020 in Phoenix, Oregon. Hundreds of homes in the town have been lost due to wildfire. David Ryder/Getty Images\n\nAnd as devastating as they have been, far worse disasters could be on the horizon.\n\nHow bad it gets depends on what we as humans do to reduce heat-trapping gas emissions, said Michael Mann, the director of Penn State University’s Earth System Science Center.\n\n“By some measure, it’s clear that ‘dangerous climate change’ has already arrived,” Mann said in response to emailed questions from CNN. “It’s a matter of how bad we’re willing to let it get.”\n\nHow climate change influences wildfires\n\nThough the scale of destruction is hard to fathom, climate scientists say we should not be surprised.\n\n“It’s shocking to see the impacts, but not scientifically surprising,” Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at UCLA and the National Center for Atmospheric Research told CNN on Tuesday. “This is in line with essentially every prediction for what could happen this year and the trends we’re seeing over years and decades.”\n\nA burned residence smolders during the Bear fire, part of the North Lightning Complex fires, in unincorporated Butte County, California on September 9, 2020. JOSH EDELSON/AFP/AFP via Getty Images\n\nScientists have warned for years that fire seasons like this could come to pass, and that the more we humans heat up the planet, the more we are increasing the odds in favor of the hot, dry conditions conducive to fires.\n\nSo far, the planet has warmed by a global average of roughly 1.2 degrees Celsius since the 1880s, with human activity responsible for the bulk of that increase.\n\nThis warming is clear in long-term temperature graphs for the state of California, such as this one below from the nonprofit environmental monitoring organization Berkeley Earth, which shows that August temperatures in the state have climbed steadily over the last 150 years.\n\nThis past August was the warmest on record for the state of California, according to NOAA, and each of the past six years were at least 1 to 2 degrees Celsius (1.8 to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than the historical average.\n\n“That couple of degrees of [average] warming over decades … you don’t notice it as much, but it’s still there lurking in the background, sucking extra moisture out of the vegetation and the soil,” Swain said.\n\nAccording to the National Climate Assessment, a major “state-of-science” review of climate change and its projected impacts on the US, additional warming of about 1.4 degrees Celsius (2.5 degrees Fahrenheit) can be expected over the next few decades regardless of future emissions.\n\nBy the second half of the century, the uncertainty range for the amount of warming grows tremendously, as so much will depend on potential cut backs in carbon emissions in the near future.\n\nThe future depends on ‘what we choose to do’\n\nLockdowns and shelter-in-place orders during the Covid-19 pandemic did result in the largest drop in greenhouse gas emissions in recorded human history.\n\nBut scientists expect the reductions will be temporary, and the policies that brought emissions down – i.e. forcing people to stay home – are not sustainable.\n\nAnd despite the brief dip in heat-trapping gas emissions, atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations are still the highest they’ve been in at least 800,000 years.\n\nScientists say the impacts of climate change are growing worse before our very eyes.\n\n“If you’re in California, or on the Gulf Coast, or in Puerto Rico, Texas, the Carolinas, or Iowa, you’ve seen the devastating consequences of climate change already,” Mann said.\n\nStill, he says there is time left to flatten the curve of global warming impacts, but the longer we wait, the steeper that curve gets.\n\n“So much depends on what we choose to do,” Mann said. “If we keep planetary warming below 1.5 Celsius, which is still possible given concerted climate action, we can keep climate change impacts within our adaptive capacity. If we don’t, we will likely exceed it.”\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nAir quality along the West Coast deteriorated to harmful levels, with Portland registering the worst air globally and Seattle the third worst.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

As such, U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agents accompany troops on patrols to conduct any law enforcement activities.\n\nBut the Insurrection Act suspends Posse Comitatus when the country faces a rebellion, political violence, or other major incidents, said Risa Brooks, a political science professor at Marquette University in Wisconsin.\n\nGet Task & Purpose in Your Inbox Sign up for Task & Purpose Today to get the latest in military news each morning, and The Pentagon Rundown for a weekly breakdown of the biggest stories every Friday.

Bush last invoked the law in 1992 in response to riots in Los Angeles following the acquittal of police officers accused of beating motorist Rodney King.\n\nIt’s worth noting that invoking the Insurrection Act is not the same as declaring martial law.\n\n“The difference from martial law is that the elected civilians remain in charge and civil law remains — the military are enforcing existing civil law, not making the laws,” said Kori Schake, head of the defense policy team at the American Enterprise Institute think tank in Washington, D.C. “They are legally empowered to behave as police, including to use lethal force to suppress insurrections, riots, and enforce the law.”\n\nAs always, there’s plenty more news.

Asylum seekers are wrapping themselves in blankets and keeping a community fire ablaze in a migrant camp near the border. Community organizers in Austin, San Antonio and other major Texas cities are hustling to rescue the unhoused as hypothermia and frostbite set in.\n\nWhile the dangerously cold weather and accompanying power outages sweeping the Lone Star State are touching nearly all Texans in some way, the crisis is especially dire for the state’s most vulnerable and marginalized communities — whose lives have already been threatened by disaster, disease and destitution in recent years. Many were simply trying not to freeze to death inside their homes and cars and on the streets as they braced for another storm Tuesday night.\n\nTexas’s crippled energy system cannot generate enough electricity to power the millions of homes on its grid — from sprawling suburban mansions to the houses and apartments occupied by families already suffering from hunger and poverty. A vivid metaphor for the state’s entrenched inequities emerged Monday night: The illuminated Texas skylines of downtown buildings and newly filled luxury hotels cast against the darkened silhouettes of freezing neighborhoods.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOver one million residents in Texas remained without electricity on Feb. 16 after a historic cold outbreak and snow storm. (Video: Justin Scuiletti, Amber Ferguson/The Washington Post)\n\nWhile local governments have maneuvered to open warming centers and respond to acute emergencies, it has often been exhausted neighbors, depleted community and faith leaders, overly taxed nonprofits and everyday people who are meeting immediate needs in the face of a state government that some say has been absent from the lives of those most vulnerable. Offering help now comes with the threat of possible exposure to the coronavirus.\n\n“Texas thinks it’s some big, bad independent state, but we can’t get the power on. We need to rethink how we do things,” said Chas Moore of the Austin Justice Coalition. “When disaster hits, it hits those communities that we historically disregard and don’t pay enough attention to.”\n\nThe blanket of snow that had at first seemed like a blessing in San Antonio turned ominous as people experiencing homelessness were thrust into life-threatening danger.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I didn’t think I’d wake up alive,” said 86-year-old Angel Rodriguez Medina, who spent Monday night in a sleeping bag amid piles of snow. “It was the worst night of my life.”\n\nMorgan Handley, a case manager with Centro San Antonio, welcomed the man into a heated car on Tuesday morning but worried about the many others he had yet to reach. A coalition of social services groups had been driving around the city in recent days and rescued more than 50 people. They were taken to converted gyms and churches — anywhere that had electricity.\n\n“I’m terrified they’re going to die,” Handley said. “Last year I lost six clients. . . . I’m terrified to see how that number is going to increase in the next few days.”\n\nA little more than an hour north, Yasmine Smith spent the weekend trying to coordinate housing for more than 200 people in hotels and shelters. Her own south Austin home has no power, and she destroyed her coffee table to have wood for the chimney. Smith said she does what she can because she can’t bear the thought of someone dying under a bridge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I believe in my city as a lifelong Austinite, and I’m proud of Texas,” said Smith, the director of justice and advocacy for the Austin-area Urban League. “But this fell on the shoulders of average people who also had to ensure their own lives were saved.”\n\nSome of the most widespread and longest-lasting power outages hit Southeast Texas and greater Houston, the state’s biggest city. A mother and daughter died after their family of four suffered carbon monoxide poisoning while warming up inside their car in the garage as temperatures plunged into the single digits.\n\nThe question of when power may be restored has yet to be answered for those who rely on electricity to survive or recover from severe illness. Ralph Riviello, chair of emergency medicine at University Health in San Antonio, said about a dozen people have come into the system’s emergency rooms needing help to recharge the batteries of their breathing machines and feeding tubes.\n\nIn Dallas, Deondre Moore raised a few hundred dollars on Facebook to buy blankets and toiletries for about a dozen people living in downtown streets. Less than 12 hours later, the temperature in Moore’s power-less apartment dropped to 20 degrees, and he had to seek shelter at a friend’s home that was still heated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFaith leaders have been reaching out to parishioners who may not live in adequate housing or have access to most public benefits. Lupita Valdez, a pastoral associate at Sacred Heart church in west San Antonio, maintains a WhatsApp group chat of more than 200 parishioners who are broken up into smaller groups to help one another.\n\nThat is how Kimberly Briseño, 23, an undocumented immigrant from Nicaragua, was connected to a fellow parishioner. She has electricity but no central heat or water in her thin-walled dwelling, which was designed as an in-law suite. She, her husband and her 5-year-old daughter stay in one room with a donated space heater all day.\n\nHer 25-year-old husband hasn’t been able to work for two weeks, and the church is helping Briseño apply for a special rental assistance grant from the city. But their meals and comfort come from a woman at church.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I’ve never experienced cold like this before. We didn’t have the right clothes or know what we needed,” said Briseño, who layered short-sleeved shirts and pajama pants to stay warm. “If it wasn’t for this lady, I don’t know what we’d do. She has taken us in like we were members of her family.”\n\nLotus Rios learned early in her youth that when one person in the community falls, everyone falls. It’s a saying her grandmother invoked often.\n\n“When you take care of people, the community takes care of you,” said Rios, who owns a community pantry she opened early in the pandemic. She stopped by the southside San Antonio house of Michael Muñoz late Tuesday to bring him menudo, a Mexican soup.\n\nThe power outage “reopens a wound for a lot of these people. The deficiencies that were already existing, all these little gaps, just got wider with covid, and now with this — this is even making it wider,” Rios said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFour weeks ago, Muñoz learned that his 68-year-old mother whom he cared for full-time had covid-19. Two weeks ago, he watched her casket being lowered into the ground.\n\nThen early Monday, he woke up shivering and learned that the house he and his mother had shared no longer had power. For more than 24 hours, Muñoz has been living in a silent house, with no music to lift his spirits or even the faint hum of the refrigerator, as he processes his mother’s death and what this new obstacle means for his future.\n\n“It’s been hard,” said Muñoz, who had to pause his college studies. “Right now I have nobody here with me, it’s just me. So there’s nobody to say, ‘I’m here with you.’ ”\n\nHis mother’s death brought with it a cascading series of financial troubles that left him strapped for cash and pressed for time as the winter storm arrived. Muñoz brought his dogs inside and wrapped the pipes outside his house in cloth and duct tape, but the precautions did little to help him keep warm in an aging, paint-chipped house with little insulation. He said he’s been charging his phone in the car, eating food he bought at the corner store in the dark and has no Internet to check for weather and news updates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I’ve been trying to roll with it. But yesterday with no power, and it’s just cold, and the dog’s acting up, and the water heater giving up, one thing after another — I had a little breakdown,” he said.\n\nMuñoz said he is frustrated by the mass outages and criticized local officials who he said are not checking in on people in his Harlandale neighborhood, an economically depressed area with poor plumbing, old houses and many elderly residents.\n\nThe 43-year-old aspiring teacher has taken to cleaning the house and sorting through his mother’s old things. Pictures of her still hang on the wall. She called herself a “union, Democrat, Catholic, Mexican American woman” Muñoz said with a chuckle. She drank Jack Daniels on the rocks and led her life independently, he said.\n\n“She raised me to be a strong person,” he said. “I know what I have to do. Hopefully I’ll pull through this and see what the next step is.”\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nAustin and San Antonio issued boil-water notices.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

The rebrand would position the blue Facebook app as one of many products under a parent company overseeing groups like Instagram, WhatsApp, Oculus, and more. A spokesperson for Facebook declined to comment for this story.\n\nFacebook already has more than 10,000 employees building consumer hardware like AR glasses that Zuckerberg believes will eventually be as ubiquitous as smartphones. In July, he told The Verge that, over the next several years, “we will effectively transition from people seeing us as primarily being a social media company to being a metaverse company.”\n\nA rebrand could also serve to further separate the futuristic work Zuckerberg is focused on from the intense scrutiny Facebook is currently under for the way its social platform operates today. A former employee turned whistleblower, Frances Haugen, recently leaked a trove of damning internal documents to The Wall Street Journal and testified about them before Congress. Antitrust regulators in the US and elsewhere are trying to break the company up, and public trust in how Facebook does business is falling.\n\nFacebook isn’t the first well-known tech company to change its company name as its ambitions expand. In 2015, Google reorganized entirely under a holding company called Alphabet, partly to signal that it was no longer just a search engine, but a sprawling conglomerate with companies making driverless cars and health tech. And Snapchat rebranded to Snap Inc. in 2016, the same year it started calling itself a “camera company” and debuted its first pair of Spectacles camera glasses.\n\nThe new Facebook company name is a closely-guarded secret\n\nI’m told that the new Facebook company name is a closely-guarded secret within its walls and not known widely, even among its full senior leadership. A possible name could have something to do with Horizon, the name of the still-unreleased VR version of Facebook-meets-Roblox that the company has been developing for the past few years. The name of that app was recently tweaked to Horizon Worlds shortly after Facebook demoed a version for workplace collaboration called Horizon Workrooms.\n\nAside from Zuckerberg’s comments, Facebook has been steadily laying the groundwork for a greater focus on the next generation of technology. This past summer it set up a dedicated metaverse team. More recently, it announced that the head of AR and VR, Andrew Bosworth, will be promoted to chief technology officer. And just a couple of days ago Facebook announced plans to hire 10,000 more employees to work on the metaverse in Europe.\n\nThe metaverse is “going to be a big focus, and I think that this is just going to be a big part of the next chapter for the way that the internet evolves after the mobile internet,” Zuckerberg told The Verge’s Casey Newton this summer. “And I think it’s going to be the next big chapter for our company too, really doubling down in this area.”\n\nComplicating matters is that, while Facebook has been heavily promoting the idea of the metaverse in recent weeks, it’s still not a concept that’s widely understood. The term was coined originally by sci-fi novelist Neal Stephenson to describe a virtual world people escape to from a dystopian, real world. Now it’s being adopted by one of the world’s largest and most controversial companies — and it’ll have to explain why its own virtual world is worth diving into.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nFacebook introduced a new infinity-shaped corporate logo.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA. A whistleblower turned over internal Facebook documents to Congress and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nB. Facebook changed its corporate name to Meta on October 28 at the company's annual Connect event.\nC. Facebook plans to change its company name to reflect its focus on the metaverse.\nD.

From New York to Wuhan, attention and resources are being directed to fight the spread of COVID-19, a disease caused by the novel coronavirus (officially, SARS-CoV-2). On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared the situation a pandemic.[1] Healthcare systems in even the most advanced countries are being overwhelmed. As the pandemic[2] spreads, the coronavirus will disproportionately impact the world’s most vulnerable, among them refugees, asylum seekers, and internally displaced people (IDPs). These populations must be included in the global response to the virus. This is essential to protecting not only these communities, but societies at large.\n\nThe scale and speed of the pandemic underscore how deeply interconnected the world’s populations are. Nevertheless, at precisely the moment when global solidarity and cooperation are essential, many nations are turning inward as they seek to protect their citizens. But a virus does not respect borders. Nor does it discriminate. A truly effective response, not to mention a morally correct one, also must not discriminate.\n\n“A virus does not respect borders. Nor does it discriminate. A truly effective response, not to mention a morally correct one, also must not discriminate.”\n\nThe world’s more than 70 million forcibly displaced people—including refugees, asylum seekers, IDPs, and other forced migrants—are among the most vulnerable. Already, their displacement leaves them disadvantaged in many ways. The impact of the epidemic both exacerbates and is exacerbated by the conditions in which they live. A series of factors make them extremely vulnerable to the spread of the virus.\n\nThe first factor is population density. Many refugees and internally displaced people live in cramped conditions, including formal camps, informal settlements, or population-dense urban spaces. Multiple families are often forced to share the same bathroom, the same cooking, and the same bathing facilities – if they have access at all. Some are forced to share the same tent. In some countries, asylum seekers and irregular migrants are placed in detention, often in appalling conditions. The ease with which the coronavirus spreads makes these living situations potentially disastrous.\n\nSecond, the forcibly displaced generally have difficulty accessing basic services—especially healthcare. When they have access, it tends to be to primary healthcare. Intensive care – the kind of care that COVID-19 patients need when they develop acute respiratory distress syndrome – is scarce to nonexistent, especially in camp settings. In addition, those fleeing conflict or natural disasters often struggle with underlying health conditions, including malnutrition, psychosocial stress, and other infectious diseases like TB. These conditions make them more vulnerable to the virus.\n\nThird, the limited access to reliable information for displaced communities will complicate efforts to respond. Misinformation, mistrust of authorities, the absence of communication networks, and language barriers can all prevent accurate and far-reaching messaging. Without critical information about the coronavirus, the displaced may not only risk spreading the infection, but find themselves in violation of new policies. At risk of deportation, asylum seekers without legal status are often reticent to trust local authorities, much less reveal themselves once they get sick.\n\nFourth, the humanitarian supply chain may be challenged by the outbreak. Relief workers may reduce or cut contact with displaced communities to help prevent spread of the virus. Many humanitarian actors will not have the training or resources to respond to such an unprecedented crisis. Governments are restricting the travel of international personnel and the movement of vital supplies. Steps to close borders, halt transportation, and shutter businesses are interrupting supply. The resulting shortages of goods could have devastating consequences in many humanitarian contexts.\n\nFinally, as governments, NGOs, and international organizations redirect their attention and resources to combat the pandemic, the financing needed to respond to ongoing humanitarian and displacement crises is at risk of falling dramatically. Already, responses to many of these crises are acutely underfunded. The lasting economic impact of the pandemic on the global economy will only aggravate this problem just as aid agencies find themselves increasingly overwhelmed.\n\nCertainly, many of the challenges that displaced people face will be shared by vulnerable and marginalized citizens in every country affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, we must recognize the unique circumstances of refugees, asylum seekers, IDPs, and other forced migrants in light of the threat an outbreak presents. What follows is a snapshot of how these and other issues are playing out across major humanitarian and displacement crises. The information and analysis in this report reveal key principles and recommendations that should be part of any effective humanitarian response to the pandemic.\n\nAsia\n\nChina was the original epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic. The outbreak of COVID-19 there raised concerns that the virus would spread to other parts of the region, including to south Asia—home to some of the world’s largest populations of refugees and IDPs. Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh, Afghan refugees in Pakistan, and millions of IDPs inside Afghanistan itself shelter in overcrowded and underserved camps and informal settlements. The coronavirus has the potential to wreak havoc in these settings.\n\nAfghan Refugees and Internally Displaced People\n\nAlmost 40 years of conflict have forcibly displaced huge numbers of Afghans. Millions have fled the country and are living in neighboring countries such as Iran, representing one of the largest protracted refugee situations in the world. Iran is a hotbed for COVID-19, now reporting the fourth highest number of deaths in the world.[3] The Iranian government faced criticism for its delay in acknowledging and responding to the seriousness of the outbreak.[4] Not until March 26—with 29,406 cases confirmed and 2,234 deaths—did the government issue an intercity travel ban and close schools, universities, national parks, and non-essential businesses.[5][6] For the more than 3 million Afghans living in Iran, the situation is most dire. Most had difficulty accessing basic services like healthcare even before the current outbreak. Tens of thousands are returning to Afghanistan.\n\nHowever, decades of war have devastated the health system in Afghanistan. Although more than 420 new health facilities have been established since 2014, the healthcare sector remains vastly under resourced.[7] There are approximately three doctors for every 10,000 patients.[8] While Afghanistan is in the midst of fragile peace negotiations, the level of violence remains remarkably high and the population’s humanitarian needs are massive. More than 2.5 million Afghans are internally displaced. Of the 120 COVID-19 cases that have been confirmed in Afghanistan,[9] a significant number had recently come from Iran.[10] They had entered through the city of Herat, where there is no health facility adequately equipped to deal with this illness. Government officials have recommended social distancing measures and even instituted a daytime curfew in Herat, but their recommendations have largely gone unheeded. On March 24, Afghanistan’s health ministry warned that half of the country’s almost 39 million people might be infected.[11]\n\nRohingya Refugees\n\nHealth authorities in Bangladesh are gearing up for a possible COVID-19 outbreak in Rohingya refugee camps. There are nearly 900,000 refugees living in the camps in Cox’s Bazar and more than 400,000 Bangladeshis living in close proximity to them. Cramped living conditions, poor water quality, and patchy access to healthcare in the camps leave refugees vulnerable to disease. A recent humanitarian risk assessment of the Rohingya response warned, “the potential mortality and morbidity risk associated with COVID-19 is likely to surpass global averages.”[12]\n\n“Cramped living conditions, poor water quality, and patchy access to healthcare in the camps leave refugees vulnerable to disease.”\n\nBangladesh’s Ministry of Health is developing a preparedness and response plan in coordination with UN agencies. Hundreds of health workers in the camp area are receiving training to improve disease outbreak detection and prevention.[13] However, UN officials privately warn that they anticipate major problems in managing the spread of the virus inside their own international workforce, much less across the refugee population. The government of Bangladesh is allowing only essential services to reach the camps, undermining efforts to address food insecurity and cyclone preparedness. Meanwhile, health workers there lack personal protective equipment such as gloves and masks. Donors and UN agencies must step up to supply these critical items.\n\nCommunicating with displaced populations about the COVID-19 outbreak will be challenging given refugees’ mistrust of authorities and the absence of formal, credible communications networks. The government continues to restrict phone and internet access in the camps while rumors and false information often spread quickly. This is likely to hinder efforts to prevent and prepare for the spread of the virus. The government of Bangladesh should therefore lift internet and phone restrictions and empower Rohingya civil society organizations that have formed in the camps in order to improve the quality and reach of essential information.[14]\n\nRohingya refugees living in the mega-camp in Bangladesh.

In many cases, this has meant blocking all incoming flights or screening and quarantining passengers of certain nationalities or arriving from specific countries. Though perhaps effective in combating the disease’s spread, these measures have also prevented the delivery of much-needed humanitarian staff and cargo to respond to ongoing crises in these countries. The potential resulting shortages of goods and technical capacity could have devastating consequences in many humanitarian contexts across the continent, where there are more than 17.7 million IDPs and over 6.3 million refugees.\n\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 could also undermine critical peacekeeping efforts in sub-Saharan Africa. Many countries that contribute troops to the United Nations (UN) peacekeeping missions are experiencing outbreaks of the novel coronavirus. As a result, and in order to curb the spread of the disease, the UN recently requested that nine troop-contributing countries delay the regular rotation of their soldiers in and out of peacekeeping missions.[15] In some cases, this could require currently deployed troops to stay in place. The pause in rotations could also lead to continued gaps in critical mission capability. Africa will be disproportionately impacted, as seven of these UN peacekeeping missions operate in conflict and humanitarian crisis zones across the continent.\n\nThe Horn of Africa\n\nEven before the outbreak of COVID-19, countries in the Horn of Africa were grappling with long-standing instability; conflict and the threat of terrorism; and the exacerbating impact of climate change and locust swarms on severe food insecurity. Now, they have registered their first cases of COVID-19—as of March 29, Somalia had three, Ethiopia had 19, and Kenya had 38 confirmed cases.[16] Kenya also confirmed its first death—a 66-year-old Kenyan man who also suffered from diabetes.[17] Meanwhile, the region is home to approximately 5.3 million IDPs and 2.5 million refugees, who are likely to be hit hardest.[18]\n\nAbsent robust public education campaigns about the coronavirus, rumors and false information are spreading rapidly. Fast and accurate information is critical in areas where the health infrastructure is weak and does not have the capacity to face an outbreak. In Ethiopia, which is host to more than 900,000 refugees and more than 2.6 million IDPs,[19] popular sentiment has violently turned against foreigners, who are being blamed for spreading the disease.[20] In Ethiopia’s western Oromia region—where intercommunal violence has displaced thousands—a months-long government-imposed shutdown of phone and internet services is further restricting the ability to provide information on the virus.[21] In addition to limiting information on COVID-19, this inhibits communication among families, doctors, and their patients.\n\nHealth experts are concerned that the outbreak in Somalia, with an IDP population of more than 2.6 million and more than 16,000 refugees, could be among the worst in the world.[22] Decades of conflict have ravaged the country’s health system and other institutions and governance is weak. Al-Shabaab, an Islamic militant group affiliated with al-Qaeda, controls large swaths of territory, limiting the state’s reach and humanitarian workers’ access to populations in need.[23] Because there are no kits to test for COVID-19 in the country, samples must be sent to South Africa for analysis, significantly delaying results and thus the ability to track the disease.[24]\n\nThe government in Somalia has halted international flights, closed schools, and prohibited large public gatherings, but the measures are not well-enforced.[25] To date, Al-Shabaab does not appear to have implemented measures in the regions it controls. Meanwhile, Somalia’s sizable displaced population is particularly at risk.[26] Humanitarian workers warn that the consequences could be devastating for the 3,000 families living in Nabadoon camp, outside Somalia’s capital of Mogadishu.[27] There, a lack of access to clean water, healthcare, and information, as well as cramped living conditions, will facilitate the spread of disease should an outbreak occur. In addition, continued conflict will complicate efforts to reach affected populations as the virus spreads.\n\nCentral Africa\n\nNigeria, where over 2 million people are internally displaced in the country’s northeast, was the first central African state to report cases of the virus. As of March 29, there were 97 confirmed cases of COVID-19.[28] Neighboring Cameroon had confirmed 91 cases, as it grapples with a series of crises that have forced 922,000 of its citizens into internal displacement.[29] Both governments have more capacity than many of their neighbors and could play a leadership role in responding to the pandemic. The Nigerian government should be applauded for working with UN leadership in the country to coordinate response efforts there. Unfortunately, other governments across the region have not done likewise.\n\nCountries like Chad and the Central African Republic (CAR) were reporting three cases in each country as of March 29; however, given the limitations of their health systems, it is uncertain if these are indicative of the actual trend.[30] The outbreak’s impact could be disastrous if the coronavirus spreads beyond the capital cities, especially for the displaced populations in both countries. There are more than half a million IDPs in CAR and 171,000 IDPs in Chad, as well as 468,000 refugees from neighboring countries.[31] These vulnerable populations have little access to clean water or healthcare facilities.\n\nMen stand outside a house in a district that welcomes internally displaced people (IDP) from northern Burkina Faso.

The coronavirus has the potential to put immense pressure on already strained national health services and healthcare provided by humanitarian actors. The situation in Burkina Faso provides a window into the nature of the challenge that could confront neighboring Mali and Niger. There are currently 207 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Burkina Faso. Eleven deaths have been reported, including that of Marie Rose Compaore, the second vice-president of the National Assembly. It is only a matter of time before the disease spreads to the country’s more than half a million IDPs.[32]\n\nAs of March 29, Mali and Niger had both reported 18 cases of COVID-19. However, the lack of infrastructure in both countries prevents both the effective detection and containment of the disease. Moreover, the internally displaced populations in both countries—171,000 people in Mali, and 187,000 in Niger—are not in camps and frequently relocate because of spreading violence.[33] This could increase the likelihood of the virus reaching them and other groups on the move.\n\nAcross the region, humanitarian funding is in short supply and displaced populations already lacks access to health services, water, and sanitation. Basic measures recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and World Health Organization—such as stringent hand washing with soap and water and social distancing—are largely impractical in this context. The UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) had planned to host a donor conference for the Sahel in mid-June to secure badly needed funding for the emergency. However, the conference has now been postponed because of COVID-19.\n\nThe Democratic Republic of Congo\n\nIn the Great Lakes Region, 30 people in Uganda, 60 in Rwanda, and 65 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) had tested positive for COVID-19 as of March 29, 2020.[34] With over 5 million displaced persons (the vast majority of whom are IDPs), the DRC has the largest number of displaced people in the region.[35] The first week of March 2020 marked the end of the DRC’s two-year-long Ebola outbreak. But the celebrations were cut short by the arrival of the novel coronavirus. As the DRC grapples with the spread of this new pandemic, it is important that health facilities built to respond to the Ebola outbreak be repurposed to treat cases of COVID-19. While discussions to that effect have already begun, very little action has been taken. NGOs are beginning to integrate messaging about the coronavirus into their current programs. However, planning and implementation must be accelerated.\n\nSouth Sudan\n\nFollowing years of civil war, nearly one-third of South Sudan’s population remains displaced—there are about 1.47 million IDPs in South Sudan and 2.2 million refugees in neighboring countries.[36] With more than half the population facing acute food insecurity and poor health infrastructure, South Sudan is highly vulnerable to the spread and harmful effects of infectious diseases. No cases of COVID-19 had been reported in the country as of publication of this report, but several cases had been confirmed in neighboring countries. To prevent and prepare for a possible outbreak, South Sudan has suspended all international flights and locked down its land borders to all but cargo buses, food trucks, and fuel tanks.[37]\n\nThe presence of a large UN peacekeeping mission with significant staff rotations in South Sudan adds an additional potential vector for the disease to spread to the country. Almost 200,000 IDPs live in Protection of Civilian sites on or near peacekeeping bases.[38] The UN and troop contributing countries are taking steps to limit the potential for exposure, including a temporary freeze on staff travel into South Sudan.[39]\n\nThe Americas\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has already had significant implications for major humanitarian hotspots across the Americas. To date, the response by governments has varied widely. Countries like Peru, Guatemala, and Colombia implemented strong measures early to combat the spread of the virus.[40] However, Mexico and Brazil have been slow to adopt mitigation measures, even dismissing the severity of the crisis.[41] In Central America, many countries have adopted stricter border policies but have acquiesced to demands from the United States to continue receiving deported nationals. Many countries in South America have closed their borders to the movement of people, including for displaced Venezuelans.\n\nThe U.S. Border\n\nThe United States now leads the world in confirmed coronavirus cases.[42] Before the outbreak of COVID-19, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) had returned over 60,000 asylum seekers to northern Mexico to await their U.S. immigration court dates there. This was done under the Trump administration’s Migration Protection Protocols (MPP), known as the “Remain in Mexico” program.[43] These asylum seekers—mostly from Central America, Cuba, and Venezuela—were returned to unsafe conditions in Mexico, and left to await their hearings in ill-equipped shelters and informal open-air encampments where disease could spread rapidly. In addition, there were 15,000 individuals waiting to seek asylum outside U.S. ports of entry as of February 2020. These individuals—three quarters of whom are Mexican—were living in the same grim conditions as those impacted by the MPP program.[44]\n\nOn March 21, the U.S. government mandated port and border closures in response to the pandemic. No exceptions are being made for asylum seekers or unaccompanied minors. The border closure empowers DHS to immediately turn back to Mexico or repatriate to their home countries other than Mexico all asylum seekers without due process—a clear violation of U.S. obligations under domestic and international law.[45] These measures were instituted well after introduction of the virus to the United States. They have impeded the ability of humanitarian workers to bring critical supplies to Mexico. In addition, some of the shelters housing asylum seekers on the Mexican side of the border have been forced to close because of the virus.[46]\n\nAs a result of the border closures, the United States has already begun to turn away or repatriate all migrants lacking documents authorizing their entry—including asylum seekers and unaccompanied minors—to countries including Mexico,[47] Guatemala,[48] Honduras,[49] and Ecuador. Authorities are not screening individuals to determine if they are victims of human trafficking or have credible fears of persecution in their home countries. Nor are they taking precautions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. The Mexican government has agreed to accept most Central American returnees (though not unaccompanied minors).[50] It is not clear if the United States or Mexico intends to arrange the deportation of others, such as Venezuelans or Cubans, in lieu of allowing them to seek asylum in the United States.\n\nMoreover, many of the NGOs that typically play a crucial monitoring role at the U.S. border have been forced to reduce or cease operations in light of efforts to reduce the spread of COVID-19 within the United States. This makes it crucial that the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) monitor returns and conditions along the border. Despite U.S. government restrictions on travel and commerce, the delivery of critical humanitarian supplies to Mexico should be considered “essential” and allowed to continue.\n\nThe rule closing the border is predicated on the false assumption that the only possible alternative to turning away asylum seekers is detaining them in unsafe, overcrowded border facilities for lengthy periods of time. In fact, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agency could instead expeditiously parole asylum seekers into the United States, where the vast majority have ties to families, friends, or faith-based communities.[51] In the weeks ahead, U.S. border officials should allow people to follow the U.S. legal process to request asylum and provide screening and referral to health facilities if necessary. Asylum seekers should then be released to homes and NGO-run shelters, through parole or other community-based alternatives to detention, where they can appropriately socially distance and be permitted to continue their cases in immigration court when the courts resume operations.[52] CBP should screen unaccompanied minors and send then to the Office of Refugee Resettlement which must, according to a new court order, quickly plan to release them to sponsors.[53]\n\nMexico\n\nMexico is both a transit and destination country for displaced people. Asylum seekers and other forced migrants come primarily from Central America, but also from South America and Africa. They are often at higher risk of exposure to the coronavirus because of their living conditions. Many are detained in detention centers known as “migratory stations,” stay in privately-run shelters while they await their asylum claims in Mexico to be processed, or, as described above, live in informal camps on the northern border while they await their court hearings in the United States.\n\nMexico has 848 registered cases of COVID-19.[54] Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador was criticized for long ignoring the crisis, even traveling across the country and holding gatherings with large crowds. Now, the government has begun to take steps to contain the virus, such as calling for Mexicans to stay in their homes for a month[55] and limiting tourism.[56] It is also working to reduce overcrowding among the migrant and forcibly displaced populations in migratory stations across the country.[57] However, the government continues to accept the return of Mexicans deported from the United States despite inadequate health screenings prior to deportation. Grim conditions and the absence of healthcare and other services in the informal camps where they often stay are perhaps of greatest concern.\n\nThe Mexican authorities must more aggressively encourage practices to prevent the spread of the coronavirus and President López Obrador should lead by example. In migratory stations, specifically, Mexico’s National Migration Institute (INAMI) should continue to implement mitigation measures and reduce the number of detained migrants when possible, with support from independent civil society organizations. The Mexican government has indicated that it would suspend the processing of asylum requests until April 20. However, it should resume these operations as soon as possible. In the interim, Mexico should ensure that asylum seekers whose claims are on hold have access to adequate shelter and healthcare, including testing for COVID-19. Mexico should not be expected to accept asylum seekers returned under the MPP program until basic safeguards can be put in place to protect the health of returnees.\n\nCentral America\n\nThe countries of Central America grapple with extreme violence and lack institutional capacity to respond to a pandemic. Civilians eager to escape violence have no recourse, prevented from fleeing because of border closures. Meanwhile, hundreds of Central Americans are deported from the United States each week.\n\nGuatemala has confirmed 34 cases COVID-19.[58] On March 16, the government suspended all international flights and closed the borders for 15 days.[59] On March 17, it announced the temporary suspension of transfers of Hondurans and Salvadorans from the United States to Guatemala under the Asylum Cooperation Agreement (ACA). (The United States has used the ACA to bar asylum seekers from applying for protection in the United States, instead sending them to Guatemala.) The Guatemalan government initially announced that it would suspend the acceptance of Guatemalan nationals deported by the Unites States. However, it reversed this decision in a just a matter of days and deportations of Guatemalans have resumed. The Guatemalan government is warning its citizens that they will be immediately deported if they attempt to go to the United States.[60]\n\nIn El Salvador, President Nayib Bukele announced that the country would bar entry to all foreigners, except accredited diplomats and legal permanent residents. President Bukele announced the creation of a special hospital for patients with COVID-19 and called for a halt of deportations from Mexico and the United States on March 18.[61] Nonetheless, deportation flights to El Salvador have continued.[62] As of March 29, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras all received U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) air flights from the United States.[63]\n\nThe Guatemalan government should remain firm in its decision to halt transfers of asylum seekers under the ACA. Even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was unreasonable to forcibly send Salvadorans and Hondurans asylum seekers to a country, Guatemala, that cannot provide them with adequate safety and security. In cases of deportation of Guatemalan, Salvadoran, or Honduran migrants who have not made claims to asylum, the United States should adopt comprehensive screenings prior to departures to ensure safety of other deportees and to avoid overwhelming these countries’ fragile health systems during this public health crisis. Guatemalans, Salvadorans, and Hondurans who test positive should not be deported.\n\nThe Venezuela Crisis\n\nUnder the regime of President Nicolás Maduro, Venezuelans have suffered years of economic collapse, institutional failure, and political turmoil. Hyperinflation, generalized violence, and political repression are rife in a country where the vast majority live in poverty. In February 2020, the UN World Food Program stated that 9.3 million people in Venezuela—about one-third of the population—faced food insecurity.[64] As more than 4.9 million people have fled the country, over 1 million children have been left without their parents.[65]\n\nAs of March 29, 2020, there were 119 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Venezuela. Although World Health Organization records do not indicate any deaths, Venezuelan officials have confirmed at least one death.[66] A “social quarantine” has been established nation-wide, and military forces have been deployed throughout the country to enforce restrictions on movement. Nevertheless, not all citizens are complying, as small crowds continue to line up to obtain food and other essential goods. On March 24, the government ordered stricter isolation measures in the three states—Caracas, Miranda, and Vargas—that account for 70 percent of COVID-19 cases.[67] The country’s years-long economic crisis has left its health system and other institutions in complete collapse.[68] Hospitals lack adequate facilities, medical personnel, supplies, and medication.[69] For the public, face masks, soap, and even water for hand-washing[70] are either unavailable or unaffordable.[71]\n\nNicolás Maduro has called on the United States to lift its sanctions on the country in order to open access to foreign investments and finance that could help fund a response. Human rights groups, and EU leaders,[72] as well as the UN Secretary-General[73] and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights[74] have echoed these calls. On March 26, the United States indicted Maduro with narco-terrorism and other serious charges in a move it could use to justify additional sanctions.[75] Maduro also tried and failed to secure a $5 billion loan from a special emergency fund of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).[76] President Xi Jinping of China sent 4,000 diagnosis kits,[77] and Cuba sent a medical brigade to help.[78] Meanwhile, Maduro’s long-held opposition to international aid organizations will further heighten the likelihood that the outbreak does outsized damage.\n\nThe pandemic risks exacerbating the pre-existing humanitarian crisis inside Venezuela—a crisis that has already compelled millions from Venezuelans to seek refuge in other countries.[79] As the situation deteriorates, more Venezuelans are likely to try to flee to neighboring Colombia and Brazil. Faced with official border closings, they may instead resort to taking dangerous unofficial routes out of the country, known as trochas, that are often controlled by armed groups. Those who are able to cross irregularly will, in turn, have trouble accessing the care they need in their host countries, and thus risk further spreading the virus.\n\nVenezuelans in Colombia\n\nAs of March 29, the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 inside Colombia had risen to 608, with six deaths reported.[80] That day, after several temporary “quarantine drills” in parts of the country, a 19-day nation-wide lockdown went into effect.[81] As of March 17, the government had closed the country’s borders. Colombia is host to the largest number of displaced Venezuelans, by far—according to official reports, more than 1.7 million Venezuelans were in Colombia as of December 31, 2019. Since the start of the displacement crisis, the Colombian government has maintained a relatively generous response.[82] However, as the international response to the Venezuelan displacement crisis remains acutely underfunded and Colombia faces its own economic challenges, the situation has begun to stress the country’s public services—including the healthcare system. The coronavirus pandemic is likely to exacerbate these challenges.\n\nThe impact of the pandemic on displaced Venezuelans living in Colombia is likely to be severe. First, despite the fact that Venezuelans have the right to free emergency healthcare in Colombia regardless of their immigration status, many cannot access that care because facilities lack capacity or because health workers are unaware of Venezuelans’ rights or even discriminate against them. Those who have regular status and are able to obtain insurance may have an easier time accessing care, and a broader range of care. Nevertheless, the majority of Venezuelans in Colombia have been unable to regularize their status. The number of Venezuelans with irregular status is only expected to increase as a result of the border closing. As indicated above, Venezuelans desperate for aid may instead resort to using informal channels to enter Colombia.[83]\n\nMany Venezuelans—including the pendulares who still live in Venezuela and cross frequently into Colombia to purchase goods or attend school—rely heavily on aid provided by international organizations and NGOs near the border. However, as part of the measures to close the border, the Colombian government ordered NGOs in the area to cut their capacity by half.[84] Moreover, on March 16, the Colombian Department of Health announced that gatherings of more than 50 people would be prohibited.[85] The restriction will inevitably impact organizations’ ability to operate in centers where Venezuelans shelter or gather to seek aid.\n\nTwo young Venezuelans with face marks cross the Rumichaca Bridge on the border between Colombia and Ecuador.

According to the latest official figures, Peru is host to the second largest number of Venezuelans (861,000 as of February 7, 2020).[86] As of December 31, 2019, Ecuador is host to 366,596 Venezuelans.\n\nOn March 15, Ecuador—where 1,823 cases and 48 deaths have now been reported—closed its borders to all foreign travelers.[87] Gatherings of more than 30 people were also banned.[88] In Peru, where 671 cases have been confirmed,[89] Peruvian President Martín Vizcarra also declared a state of emergency on March 15 and initially shut the country’s borders for 15 days.[90] Four days later, the government imposed a nationwide curfew and ban on private vehicles.[91]On March 25, President Vizcarra extended a state of emergency and nationwide quarantine through April 12.[92]\n\nThese border closures affect Venezuelans on the move from Colombia to Ecuador, Peru, and other third countries. For Venezuelans already inside these host countries, limited access to healthcare, loss of their livelihoods, and limits on movement and available services will put them at higher risk of infection or complications.\n\nOn March 18, Brazil ordered a partial closing of its border with Venezuela for 15 days.[93] President Bolsonaro has been criticized for his lax response to the pandemic, raising fears that the toll inside the country will be high.[94]Already, by March 25, there were 2,271 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 47 deaths. The latest official figures indicate that Brazil was host to more than 250,000 Venezuelans as of November 30, 2019, though the current number is likely much higher. Despite the government’s attempts to relocate Venezuelans who have crossed into the country, the majority remain concentrated in remote, impoverished areas along the northern border, where resources and infrastructure are sparse.[95] The inevitable damage from the coronavirus is thus likely to affect Venezuelans inside the country even as the border closing hinders others from accessing the critical healthcare they lack in Venezuela.\n\nEurope\n\nEurope has been hard hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. At the end of 2018, there were nearly 2.5 million refugees and 646,060 asylum seekers in the European Union (EU) alone.[96] As of March 17, just 10 cases had been reported among refugees and asylum seekers, all of them in Germany. Already, however, countries had begun to close their borders to asylum seekers. By March 16, Greece, Hungary, Belgium, and the Netherlands had shut their asylum offices.[97] In other countries, including Italy, asylum services have significantly slowed. Due to health and travel restrictions imposed to contain the spread of the coronavirus, NGOs have had to suspend search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean Sea for those attempting to cross from war-torn Libya.[98] Meanwhile, nationalist leaders and politicians—from Italy to Spain—have seized upon the outbreak as a false basis for xenophobic, anti-refugee rhetoric and policies.[99]\n\nItaly\n\nAs of March 29, 2020, there were 92,472 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy and 10,023 deaths—more deaths than in any other country. More than ten days after ordering a strict, nationwide lockdown, with the number of deaths surging, the Italian government called in the military on March 20 to enforce its approach.[100] On March 22, the Prime Minister ordered all non-essential businesses and factories to close and prohibited all non-essential movement within the country.[101] Even as the number of new cases in Italy began to slow, the government was expected to extend containment measures beyond the initial April 3 deadline.[102]\n\nThe impact on refugees and asylum seekers has been significant.[103] At the end of 2018, there were nearly 300,000 refugees and asylum seekers in Italy. Heeding lockdown and “social distancing” orders is difficult for these individuals, who often work in informal jobs, live in close quarters, and rely on government and NGO assistance. On March 12, the government suspended interviews for refugee status determination (RSD) and hearings for appeals of rejected asylum requests given court closures. By law, foreigners in Italy have access to healthcare. In practice, many asylum seekers fear going to hospitals if undocumented, or face discrimination or language barriers. All this will make it harder to detect the virus in a highly vulnerable population.\n\nGreece\n\nAs of March 29, Greece confirmed 1,156 coronavirus cases and 38 deaths.[104] While this is less than several other European countries, the Greek government is concerned that if it does not act quickly, it could follow the trajectory of Italy. Greece has therefore enacted a country-wide lockdown, closing hotels and suspending most international flights.[105] The Ministry of Migration and Asylum has suspended all administrative services until April 13 at the earliest. This includes registering asylum seekers, conducting interviews, adjudicating cases, and reviewing appeals.\n\nThe shutdown of the entire Greek asylum system leaves all asylum seekers in a precarious position. Arguably, no population in Greece is more vulnerable to the coronavirus than the more than 40,000 asylum seekers trapped on the Aegean Islands.[106] Conditions are appalling in the Reception and Identification Centers (RICs) where asylum seekers are required to live. The official RICs and their overflow areas are squalid and overcrowded, hosting approximately eight times their capacity. These areas lack basic hygiene facilities, have very few latrines, and provide minimal medical care at best. There is no running water, making frequent hand washing impractical.\n\nMigrants living in the Moria camp sew handmade protective face masks on the Greek island of Lesbos, as the country is under lockdown to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus. Photo by MANOLIS LAGOUTARIS/AFP/Getty Images.\n\nNGOs on the islands report that no significant steps have been taken to prepare the camps for an outbreak of the coronavirus. Instead, the government instituted a curfew and prohibited NGOs from entering the camps for at least 14 days.[107] These measures reduce essential services in the camps, including food distributions, childcare, and servicing latrines. Relief groups have been calling on the Greek government to evacuate camp residents to facilities across the country in order to save the lives of asylum seekers and Greek citizens alike.[108] The EU has now echoed this call to evacuate the most vulnerable asylum seekers in the camps to other areas on the islands,[109] a crucial first step to protect asylum seekers and limit the likely spread in the camps.\n\nThe Middle East\n\nThe Middle East is fast becoming an epicenter of the coronavirus crisis. Cases have escalated dramatically in Lebanon and Iran. New infections have emerged in more than half a dozen other countries in the region including Iraq and Afghanistan. At least 12 million refugees and IDPs live in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Turkey. Borders throughout the Middle East are porous, with refugees, economic migrants, and others often traveling along informal routes. Another challenge to an effective coronavirus response is the region’s weak or broken public health systems.\n\nHowever, the situation also differs significantly between countries. Turkey, with over 3.4 million Syrian refugees, has a robust healthcare system and the government is somewhat better positioned to respond to an outbreak and employ basic containment tools like contact tracing. On the other hand, Iraq and Lebanon have severely weak public health systems and are not able to adequately monitor what is going on and provide a robust public health response.\n\nThe Syria Crisis\n\nSyria’s brutal war entered its tenth year last month. More than 5.6 million have fled Syria since 2011, and over 6.5 million remain displaced inside the country.[110] The majority of Syrian refugees in neighboring countries and internally displaced Syrians lack the most basic needs, including access to healthcare. Even the most basic guidance on social distancing and personal hygiene will be difficult to follow where refugees and IDPs often live in overcrowded and unhygienic camps and informal settlements.\n\nThe situation in the northwest of Syria is of particular concern. It will be extremely challenging to launch an effective response to a coronavirus outbreak in places like Idlib province. While no confirmed cases of Coronavirus have been announced in Idlib, this appears to be largely due to the lack of testing kits. At least three people who showed symptoms of COVID-19 died in the past week, and there are several other patients with the virus symptoms who are quarantined inside hospitals, a doctor and a representative of a medical organization in Idlib told Refugees International. More than 1 million people are staying in overcrowded and unhygienic camps where it is very challenging to impose social distancing.[111] Very few people are staying home. The economic situation is such that if people do not work, they do not have the means to feed their families. Moreover, there is no authority inside Idlib that has the means to enforce preventive measures, and the various fighting factions on the ground appear to have other priorities.\n\nSyrians are seen on the mud covered road between tents at a refugee camp after heavy rain in Idlib, Syria.

The facilities that remain will have little of the equipment required to treat coronavirus patients, such as ventilators, or to protect healthcare workers from infection as they go about their duties. On March 25, WHO delivered 300 testing kits to the northwest.[112] The main challenge is that the whole area has only around 100 ventilators. Efforts to screen populations with infrared non-contact thermometers are also necessary. Any type of support for the general capacity of what remains of the medical system in northwest Syria could make a significant difference.\n\nOutside of Syria, more needs to be done now to help prepare the camps and communities that host Syrian refugees in neighboring countries. Countries like Lebanon, host to more than 1 million Syrian refugees, are already experiencing significant outbreaks that are taxing their national healthcare systems. Jordan hosts the second largest Syrian refugee population per capita in the world. Because these refugees are unlikely to be a top priority for the national authorities, the international humanitarian community must step in to fill the gaps, in collaboration with host governments.\n\nIraq\n\nDecades of conflict and widespread violence have wreaked havoc on the lives of millions of civilians in Iraq. According to UNHCR, more than 6.5 million people—approximately 18 percent of the population—are currently in need of humanitarian assistance, including 3 million children.[113] Nearly 2 million people remain displaced inside the country, the majority of whom have taken refuge in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI). Moreover, Iraq is host to around 300,000, mostly Syrian, refugees.[114] Many live inside camps where poor conditions and outdated infrastructure could exacerbate the spread of the coronavirus.[115]\n\nAs of March 29, 547 cases of confirmed coronavirus had been reported in Iraq.[116] However, the real number was likely much higher. The country’s health system, undermined by decades of sanctions, neglect, corruption and violence, suffers from significant gaps including shortages of supplies, equipment, and staff.[117] To prevent further spread of the virus, the Baghdad and KRI governments imposed a curfew and cancelled all domestic flights. However, security forces are struggling to enforce the lockdown as thousands of pilgrims from across the country visit shrines in the capital.[118] In addition, humanitarian actors have reported that curfews and movement restrictions are impacting the delivery of assistance to people in need.[119]\n\nHumanitarian groups in Iraq have developed a COVID-19 preparedness and response planning in the camps. Moreover, UN agencies are supporting Iraq with testing capacities and the procurement of personal protective equipment for health partners. Donors and humanitarian organizations should increase their efforts to support Iraq and the KRI government’s response. They should offer personnel support to fill staff shortages and provide the necessary supplies and equipment.\n\nYemen\n\nThe WHO announced that, so far, there are no confirmed cases of coronavirus in Yemen.[120] However, a virus outbreak will almost certainly have a devastating effect. Yemen hosts what may be the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, with more than 24 million people in need of assistance, and nearly 3.65 million internally displaced.[121] A relentless war has decimated the country’s healthcare system. In the past few years, Yemen has witnessed the worst cholera epidemic in recent history.[122]\n\nLast week, both the Houthi rebels and Yemen’s internationally recognized government banned international flights in an attempt to keep the country free of the coronavirus.[123] The ban includes chartered medical evacuations. Despite the halt to passenger flights, the UN-led Yemen aid operation continues for the moment, with the vast majority of staff being Yemeni. The UN confirmed that seaports remain open for cargo. Yemen is largely reliant on cargo arriving by sea for imports of food, fuel, and other consumer essentials critical to civilian welfare.\n\nThe WHO is supporting the national health authorities to prepare for the coronavirus with medical supplies, testing kits, training, and information campaigns. However, some international relief teams have scaled back to essential staff only. A fingerprint-driven digital registration system for aid recipients to limit aid fraud has been paused.[124] Top priority, life-saving assistance such as food, water, sanitation, and health services will continue, but some less critical aid programs will be slowed. The international humanitarian community must step in to help Yemen’s medical personnel to prepare for a virus outbreak. It should particularly provide medical facilities with testing kits, medical equipment, and supplies in addition to personnel protective gear to help protect healthcare workers.\n\nRecommendations\n\nThe challenge of containing and mitigating the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic across the world’s most vulnerable, displaced populations is breathtaking in scope. Each humanitarian crisis will require a strategy tailored to the specific needs and circumstances of the displaced population in question – a strategy that is workable in a context that will undoubtedly include significant resource constraints. That said, there are common elements across the countries and continents reviewed above, which lend themselves to key principles and recommendations that should be part of any effective humanitarian response to the pandemic.\n\nThe response must be inclusive: The response to COVID-19 must be inclusive if it is to be effective. International assistance to address the pandemic must reach all vulnerable populations, including the refugees, asylum seekers, and the internally displaced. Governments receiving U.S. assistance for COVID-19 should ensure that the forcibly displaced living in both camp and non-camp settings are included in prevention and mitigation efforts. By the same token, aid for refugees and internally displaced people to address the COVID-19 pandemic should be made available to host communities in refugee-hosting areas. In short, the aim should be to improve systems for all persons regardless of nationality.\n\nEnhance communications and the flow of information: Governments and international aid groups should develop information campaigns to ensure displaced communities have accurate and current information about the coronavirus and response efforts. Where possible, they should work with local civil society and displaced persons themselves to ensure language and means of communications are easily accessible and widely disseminated. Governments should lift any phone and internet restrictions in and around displaced communities.\n\nDeploy medical personnel, supplies, and personal protective equipment: Donors and international aid groups should prioritize the deployment of qualified medical personnel to refugee, asylum seeker, and IDP-dense areas, along with personal protective equipment and other medical supplies such as gloves and masks for humanitarian health workers to ensure their safety in addressing COVID-19 outbreaks in displacement camps. Appropriate training for existing health care personnel must occur, particularly for treatment of severe cases with limited ICU access.\n\nPrioritize hygiene and other WASH-related interventions: Donors and international aid groups should improve access to water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) facilities for refugee and internally displaced populations – especially those living in camps or camp-like settings. This should include the distribution of essential personal hygiene items including soap and disposable towels. The response should also recognize best practices for response for particularly vulnerable populations, such as women and girls.\n\nFocus on decongestion and isolation and quarantine capacities: Donors, host governments, and international aid groups should prioritize decongestion and building isolation and quarantine capacities in camps and camp-like settings. Services like food distribution and education should be restructured to avoid large gatherings. Donors and others should take steps now to support establishment of capabilities within displaced communities for implementation of isolation and quarantine procedures in accordance with best medical and public health advice and practices. Given the extremely high density of certain settings, novel strategies for “shielding” may need to be carefully attempted.\n\nBuild up testing and surveillance capabilities: Donors and international aid groups should prioritize deployment of rapid testing capability in adequate quantity to refugee and IDP settings. With respect to surveillance, the good news is that many formal camps already have epidemiological surveillance systems already in place. These need to be strengthened and adapted to screen for COVID-19, especially for all new arrivals in the camps.\n\nStop detentions and deportations of asylum seekers: Public health officials universally agree that detention in crowded facilities increases the risk of transmission for asylum seekers and immigrants in custody, along with immigration and border officials. Governments should put in place alternatives to detention polices and ensure that all migrants have access to testing and healthcare regardless of status. Deportation of any individuals without prior medical testing risks exporting the virus into countries unprepared to deal with mass outbreaks because of pre-existing crises and substantial vulnerable and marginalized populations with little access to limited healthcare systems.\n\nProtect those who fear persecution from forced return: Any restrictions that governments impose on travel should include provisions that safeguard individuals from forced return to torture or persecution. Moreover, extraordinary policy measures that impose unusual burdens for those seeking asylum should be lifted as soon as circumstances permit. In times of national emergency, protecting vulnerable people from gross abuses of their basic rights can become far more challenging for governments, but it is at those very times when our commitment to such rights is decisively measured.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nRefugees International would like to thank the following people for their contributions to this report:\n\nTony Banbury , President and CEO of the International Foundation for Electoral Systems\n\n, President and CEO of the International Foundation for Electoral Systems Chris Beyrer , Desmond M.

The former president, Donald Trump, recognized that the American people were tired of the ongoing war in Afghanistan, which was approaching its 20th year, and in February 2020, his administration negotiated with the Taliban to enable the U.S. to withdraw. In exchange for the release of 5000 Taliban fighters and the promise that the U.S. would withdraw within the next 14 months, the Taliban agreed not to attack U.S. soldiers.\n\nTrump’s dislike of the war in Afghanistan reflected the unpopularity of the long engagement, which by 2020 was ill defined. The war had begun in 2001, after terrorists affiliated with al-Qaeda attacked the United States on September 11 of that year. Taliban leaders in control of Afghanistan sheltered al-Qaeda, and after the attacks, the U.S. president, George W. Bush, demanded that Afghanistan hand over the terrorist leader believed to be behind the terrorist attack on the U.S: Osama bin Laden. In October, after Taliban leaders refused, the U.S. launched a bombing campaign.\n\nThat campaign was successful enough that in December 2001 the Taliban offered to surrender. But the U.S. rejected that surrender, determined by then to eradicate the extremist group and fill the vacuum of its collapse with a new, pro-American government. Al-Qaeda leader bin Laden escaped from Afghanistan to Pakistan, and the U.S. project in Afghanistan turned from an anti-terrorism mission into an effort to rebuild the Afghan government into a modern democracy.\n\nBy 2002 the Bush administration was articulating a new doctrine in foreign policy, arguing that the U.S. had a right to strike preemptively against countries that harbor terrorists. In 2003, under this doctrine, the U.S. launched a war on Iraq, which diverted money, troops, and attention from Afghanistan. The Taliban regrouped and began to regain the territory it had lost after the U.S. first began its bombing campaign in 2001.\n\nBy 2005, Bush administration officials privately worried the war in Afghanistan could not be won on its current terms, especially with the U.S. focused on Iraq. Then, when he took office in 2009, President Barack Obama turned his attention back to Afghanistan. He threw more troops into that country, bringing their numbers close to 100,000. In 2011, the U.S. military located bin Laden in Abbottabad, Pakistan, and launched a raid on the compound where he was hiding, killing him. By 2014, Obama had drawn troops in Afghanistan down to about 11,000, and in December of that year, he announced that the mission of the war—weakening the Taliban and capturing bin Laden—had been accomplished, and thus the war was over. The troops would come home.\n\nBut, of course, they didn’t, leaving Trump to develop his own policy. But his administration’s approach to the chaos in that country was different than his predecessor’s. By negotiating with the Taliban and excluding the Afghan government the U.S. had been supporting, the Trump team essentially accepted that the Taliban were the most important party in Afghanistan. The agreement itself reflected the oddity of the negotiations. Each clause referring to the Taliban began: “The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan which is not recognized by the United States as a state and is known as the Taliban will….”\n\nIt was immediately clear that the Taliban was not living up to its side of the bargain. Although it did stop attacking U.S. troops, It began to escalate violence in Afghanistan itself, assassinated political opponents, and maintained ties to al-Qaeda. Nonetheless, the Trump administration put pressure on the leaders of the Afghan government to release the 5000 Taliban prisoners, and they eventually did. Before Biden took office, Trump dropped the U.S. troop engagement in Afghanistan from about 13,000 to about 2500.\n\nWhen he took office, Biden had to decide whether to follow Trump’s path or to push back on the Taliban on the grounds they were not honoring the agreement Trump’s people had hammered out. Biden himself wanted to get out of the war. At the same time, he recognized that fighting the Taliban again would mean throwing more troops back into Afghanistan, and that the U.S. would again begin to take casualties. He opted to get the troops out, but extended the deadline to September 11, 2021, the twentieth anniversary of the initial attack. (Former president Trump complained that the troops should come out faster.)\n\nWhat Biden did not foresee was the speed with which the Taliban would retake control of the country. It swept over the regional capitals and then Kabul in about nine days in mid-August with barely a shot fired, and the head of the Afghan government fled the country, leaving it in chaos.\n\nThat speed left the U.S. flatfooted. Afghans who had been part of the government or who had helped the U.S. and its allies rushed to the airport to try to escape. In the pandemonium of that first day, up to seven people were killed; two people appear to have clung to a U.S. military plane as it took off, falling to their deaths.\n\nAnd yet, the Taliban, so far, has promised amnesty for its former opponents and limited rights for women. It has its own problems, as the Afghan government has been supported for the previous 20 years by foreign money, including a large percentage from the U.S. Not only has that money dried up as foreign countries refuse to back the Taliban, but also Biden has put sanctions on Afghanistan and also on some Pakistanis suspected of funding the Taliban. At the same time it appears that no other major sponsor, like Russia or China, has stepped in to fill the vacuum left by U.S. money, leaving the Taliban fishing for whatever goodwill it can find.\n\nYesterday, Josh Marshall of Talking Points Memo flagged tweets showing that members of the Afghan government, including the brother of the president who fled, are in what appear from the photos posted on Twitter to be relaxed talks about forming a new government. Other factions in Afghanistan would like to stop this from happening, and today Biden’s national security adviser Jake Sullivan warned that ISIS-K, another extremist group, is threatening to attack the airport to destabilize the Taliban.\n\nMeanwhile, there are 10,000 people crowded into that airport, and U.S. evacuations continue. The Kabul airport is secure—for now—and the U.S. military has created a larger perimeter around it for protection. The U.S. government has asked Americans in Afghanistan to shelter in place until they can be moved out safely; the Qatari ambassador to Afghanistan has been escorting groups of them to the airport. Evacuations have been slower than hoped because of backlogs at the next stage of the journey, but the government has enlisted the help of 18 commercial airlines to move those passengers forward, leaving room for new evacuees.\n\nYesterday, about 7800 evacuees left the Kabul airport. About 28,000 have been evacuated since August 14.\n\nInterestingly, much of the U.S. media is describing this scenario as a disaster for President Biden.

It says the president “gravely and extensively violated the constitution and the law” and accuses him of imposing martial law “with the unconstitutional and illegal intent to evade imminent investigations … into alleged illegal acts involving himself and his family”.\n\nIn an early Thursday morning session, lawmakers presented the impeachment motion to parliament.\n\n“This is an unforgivable crime – one that cannot, should not, and will not be pardoned,” MP Kim Seung-won said.\n\nYoon’s governing People Power Party said it would oppose the motion but the party has been divided over the crisis. The opposition Democratic Party, which has a majority in parliament, needs at least eight governing party lawmakers to back the bill in order for it to pass.\n\nUnder South Korea’s constitution, impeachment requires a two-thirds majority in the 300-member National Assembly. The Democratic Party currently holds 170 seats in parliament. A vote could take place as soon as Friday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe leader of the governing party on Wednesday slammed the incident and called for those involved to be held accountable.\n\n“The president must directly and thoroughly explain this tragic situation,” Han Dong-hoon told reporters in a televised broadcast.\n\nIf the National Assembly does agree to impeach, Yoon will be temporarily stripped of his presidential authority while the constitutional court considers his fate.\n\nSeveral senior officials have offered their resignations in the wake of the bungled events, including Presidential Chief of Staff Chung Jin-suk, National Security Adviser Shin Won-sik, and Presidential Chief of Staff for Policy Sung Tae-yoon.\n\nPrime Minister Han Duck-soo pledged to continue serving the people “until the last moment” and asked the cabinet to fulfil its responsibility together with the public officials of all ministries.\n\nThe Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, one of the country’s largest labour organisations, had called for a strike until the president’s resignation.\n\nOverreach\n\nYoon announced he would lift the martial law order hours after the initial declaration on Tuesday.\n\nHe had said he was forced to issue the order “to defend the free Republic of Korea from the threats of North Korean communist forces” and accused the political opposition of “paralysing” his government and “undermining” the constitutional order.\n\nLawmakers then tussled with soldiers in order to enter parliament where they passed a legally binding motion forcing Yoon to reverse the order.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Democratic Party leader, Park Chan-dae, warned soon after the martial law order ended that Yoon “cannot avoid the charge of treason”.\n\nGreg Scarlatoiu, the president and CEO of the Committee for Human Rights in North Korea, told Al Jazeera that Article 77 of the South Korean Constitution stipulates that martial law may be declared when the country basically faces an existential threat.\n\n“It seems that this is a fairly frivolous exercise in declaring martial law,” he said.\n\nScarlatoiu noted that there may be some basis to Yoon’s assertion of a threat to national security. The Democratic Party, which holds the majority in parliament, has made it impossible for the executive branch to operate.\n\nYet, the fact that 190 members of parliament rejected martial law was a sign the president had overreached.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nPolice, parliament, prosecutors, and the anti-corruption body launched separate investigations into Yoon on treason allegations.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

How will he eventually go? Who is likely to succeed him? Surely a dictator so surrounded by sycophantic generals, spies and secret policemen could ward off any serious threat? There was no one obvious to lead a move to throw him out. Anyway, his successor might be even worse. The broad conclusion was that he could be with us for a long time.\n\nThese were always fragile arguments. No dictator foresees the coup that overthrows him. No one can follow all the intrigues from outside. All politicians eventually lose their political instincts. It took Mrs Thatcher thirteen years. Putin has been there nearly twice as long- and his position has become increasingly brittle.\n\nWhen he moved centre stage as president in 2000, Putin promised the Russians prosperity, stability and the restoration of their self-respect after the chaotic poverty and humiliation of the Yeltsin years. His innate political cunning was accompanied by good fortune. High oil prices gave him the money to meet most of his popular promises. People turned a blind eye to his brutal rule and the corruption of his associates.\n\nBut he became obsessed with Ukraine. Like many of his countrymen, he resented the way it had detached itself from Russia after what they saw as centuries of intimate partnership, and he was determined to do something about it. He began by interfering directly with Ukrainian domestic politics in order to increase his own influence and reduce that of the West. Next, by means of a rather well-executed coup de main, he annexed Crimea to Russia, claiming that Ukraine had acquired it illegally as the result of an irresponsible political gesture by the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev six decades earlier. Then, scarcely bothering to hide what he was doing, he gave military and political support to the rebels fighting to bring Eastern Ukraine into Russia.\n\nFinally, he launched a full-scale invasion, on the pretext that Ukrainian fascists had already begun a war with the help of the West, designed to destroy the thousand-year-old Russian state. He evidently thought that could quickly reduce Ukraine to a vassal or take it over entirely. The Ukrainians surprised him, the West, and perhaps even themselves by the courageous ingenuity of their resistance.\n\nPutin tried to compensate for military failure by a burst of patriotic hysteria. He then made a further massive misjudgement. No dictator in his right mind allows a subordinate to build an independent military force. But, as he ran short of Russian regular and conscript soldiers, he farmed out part of the battle to a crony from the lower depths of St Petersburg, Yevgeny Prigozhin, who contributed his own army of convicts sprung from the prisons of Russia. They were fairly effective and grotesquely brutal, but they were unable to break the Ukrainians.\n\nPrigozhin was scornful of the incompetent way the Russian military had managed the initial stages of the war. He was deeply resentful of their attempts to gain control over him. He claimed that they were deliberately starving his men of weapons and ammunition. The war, he went on to trumpet, was nothing to do with Ukrainian Fascists: it was simply a get-rich-quick scheme devised by greedy and ambitious generals for their own benefit. This was already a serious swipe at Putin. But on 23 June Prigozhin tipped over into armed rebellion. He and his men put tanks on the streets of Rostov-on-Don, the logistics and communications hub for the Russian army in Ukraine, and took over the military headquarters there. He demanded that the military leadership come to him: otherwise he would go to Moscow to get them himself. He claimed it was not a coup, but a demand for justice.\n\nAt first Putin appears to have tried force. There are stories that Prigozhin’s men were bombarded by missiles and attacked by helicopters. But he failed to clip Prigozhin’s wings. He then accused Prigozhin on television of betraying his country and his people in their time of need, and called for his arrest. He drew a remarkably inept parallel with the events of 1917 – it’s not clear whether he was referring to the mutinies that brought down the Tsar in February оr the march on the capital by a rebellious general in August. Either way, people’s blood must have run cold as they remembered the horrors which followed that disastrous year.\n\nPutin’s ministers and generals, his spies and his policemen, rallied round him, at least in public. So did thugs, such as Ramzan Kadyrov, who has ruled Chechnya since Putin pounded it into submission. The authorities dug up the roads to Moscow as Prigozhin and his soldiers approached. Abandoning his threat to prosecute the traitor, Putin got his crony, the Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko, to negotiate a deal. Saying he wanted to avoid bloodshed, Prigozhin marched his men back down the hill. It’s not yet clear where they will end up, or who will pay for them when they get there. But as they left Rostov they were cheered on the streets.\n\nPrigozhin bottled out and made a fool of himself. But Putin’s weakness has been shown up and his authority diminished. Much of the detail is still murky. The right-wing extremists who used to support Prigozhin are still around. We don’t know what the soldiers in the field or the wretched Russian people really think or how they will finally jump. We still have no idea how or when Putin will go, or who will succeed him. But the end of the Putin era is surely heaving into sight.\n\nMeanwhile, Moscow has a war to fight.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nPutin delivered a televised address accusing Prigozhin of treason.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

I do not want to hear his name again, and I want it to disappear from the news. If that happens, hopefully this man who thrived on holding power over women will start feeling powerless. Worthless. Alone.\n\nWho I do care about is you, the ones who tweeted #MeToo. The women who have experienced the pain of feeling powerless, worthless and alone. Because you are the ones who deserve to be heard and have a voice louder than those who wish to silence it.\n\nWhat is #MeToo? Two small words — one big meaning — and a force across social media.\n\nIf you’ve been on Twitter or Facebook at all in the past few days and follow any of the millions of women who have used this hashtag, you know what I’m referring to. With a simple tweet on Sunday, Alyssa Milano started a firestorm when she asked that anyone who had been sexually harassed to reply with “me too.”\n\nWho’s the boss? Alyssa is.\n\nDifficult conversation about sexual harassment grows larger\n\nAlthough originally in response to Weinstein and the slew of similar sexual harassment reports now widespread across the news, #MeToo has quickly grown into a larger conversation, and it’s a difficult one. From those worried that the conversation could lead to witch hunts to women calling for fewer hashtags and more change, everyone seems to have joined the discussion.\n\nFor me, that alone is very worthwhile. Not that I feel warm and fuzzy seeing women come out en masse to share their horror stories — well, other than Mayim Bialik — I do have a strange sense of pride watching the story unfold, as women are being so open, bold and truthful.\n\nMaybe the truth can set us free?\n\nThat sounds so simplistic. Don’t get me wrong, I absolutely do not believe that the answer to a cultural change is that easy, but I do feel that it’s a start. There’s power in words, just as there is power in secrecy. If our culture starts talking about things that have, for so long, been closed-door conversations, is it possible that those conversations could reduce the frequency and acceptance of harassment? If women no longer feel that they have to be ashamed and bad conduct is not swept under the rug for fear of repercussions, would more voices be heard? And, if the women that come forward are given an active voice to describe the offense AND offender, rather than minimizing the situation as a women’s issue (see video above; thank you, Jackson Katz!), would they be less likely to hesitate?\n\nAt the same time that I ask these questions to you, I also ask them of myself. Would I be less afraid if society accepted open dialogue about sexual harassment and rape without implication of fault on the victim? Obviously, I would. Until that day when I can share my own stories of harassment — and even assault — I’ll just say this: #MeToo.\n\nLisha Dunlap Lisha Dunlap is a NonDoc commentator and freelance writer with a mass media degree from Washburn University.

Our 20 years of sacrifice worked.\"\n\nIn Washington, Gen. Frank McKenzie, head of U.S. Central Command, announced the completion of America's longest war and the evacuation effort, saying the last planes took off from Kabul airport at 3:29 p.m. EDT — one minute before midnight Monday in Kabul.\n\n\"We did not get everybody out that we wanted to get out,\" he said.\n\nWith its last troops gone, the U.S. ended its 20-year war with the Taliban back in power. Many Afghans remain fearful of their rule or of further instability, and there have been sporadic reports of killings and other abuses in areas under Taliban control despite the group's pledges to restore peace and security.\n\n\"American soldiers left the Kabul airport, and our nation got its full independence,\" Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said early Tuesday.\n\nThe U.S. and its allies invaded Afghanistan shortly after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attack on the United States, which al-Qaida orchestrated while sheltering under Taliban rule. The invasion drove the Taliban from power in a matter of weeks and scattered Osama bin Laden and other top al-Qaida leaders.\n\nThe U.S. and its allies launched an ambitious effort to rebuild Afghanistan after decades of war, investing billions of dollars in a Western-style government and security forces. Women, who had been largely confined to their homes under the Taliban's hard-line rule, benefited from access to education and came to assume prominent roles in public life.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBut the Taliban never went away.\n\nIn the coming years, as the U.S. focused on another troubled war in Iraq and the Afghan government became mired in corruption, the Taliban regrouped in the countryside and in neighboring Pakistan. In recent years, they seized large parts of rural Afghanistan and carried out near-daily assaults on Afghan security forces.\n\nEager to end the war, the Trump administration signed a peace deal with the Taliban in February 2020 that paved the way for the withdrawal. President Joe Biden extended the deadline from May to August and continued with the pullout despite the Taliban's rapid blitz across the country earlier this month.\n\nNow the Taliban control all of Afghanistan except for the mountainous Panjshir province, where a few thousand local fighters and remnants of Afghanistan's collapsed security forces have pledged to resist them. The Taliban say they are seeking a peaceful resolution there.\n\nThey face much graver challenges now that they govern one of the poorest and most war-ravaged nations on Earth.\n\nIn recent days Afghans have lined up outside banks as an economic crisis that predates the Taliban takeover worsens. A string of attacks by the Islamic State extremist group's local affiliate, including a barrage of rockets fired at the airport Monday, shows the security challenges the Taliban face.\n\nOn Thursday, an Islamic State suicide attack at an airport gate killed at least 169 Afghans and 13 U.S. service members. The extremist group is far more radical than the Taliban, and the two groups have fought each other before. The Taliban say they will prevent Afghanistan from again being used as a base for terror attacks, a pledge that will likely be tested soon.\n\nMcKenzie said the Taliban were \"significantly helpful\" in enabling the airlift but will have difficulty securing Kabul in the coming days, not least because of the threat they face from IS. He said the Taliban had freed IS fighters from prisons, swelling their ranks to an estimated 2,000.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"Now they are going to be able to reap what they sowed,\" the American general said.\n\nMany Afghans fear the Taliban themselves, who governed the country under a harsh interpretation of Islamic law from 1996 until 2001. In those years they banned television and music, barred women from attending school or working outside the home, and carried out public executions.\n\nThe Taliban have sought to project a more moderate image since the takeover. They say women will be able to attend school and work, and have renounced any revenge attacks on Afghans who worked with the former government, the U.S. or its allies.\n\nMany Afghans are deeply skeptical of such promises, and fear of the Taliban's rule drove tens of thousands to flee the country over the past two weeks. Thousands more waited in vain outside the airport, many of them standing for hours in a sewage canal.\n\nThe Kabul international airport had been one of the few ways out. At one point people flooded onto the tarmac and seven fell to their deaths after clinging to a plane that was taking off. Another seven died in a stampede of people outside an airport gate.\n\nThe Taliban have said they will allow normal travel, but it is unclear how they will run the airport and which commercial carriers will begin flying in, given security concerns.\n\nQatar, a close U.S. ally that has long hosted a Taliban political office, has been taking part in negotiations about operations at the airport with Afghan and international parties, mainly the U.S. and Turkey. Qatari Assistant Foreign Minister Lolwa al-Khater said its main priority is restoring regular operations while maintaining security at the airport.\n\nThe last known U.S. military operation in Afghanistan came Sunday, when American officials said a drone strike blew up a vehicle carrying IS suicide bombers who were planning to attack the airport.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBut like so much about the Afghanistan war, it may not have gone as planned.\n\nRelatives of those killed in Sunday's strike said it killed civilians who had nothing to do with the extremist group.\n\nNajibullah Ismailzada said his brother-in-law, Zemarai Ahmadi, had just arrived home from his job working with a Korean charity. As he drove into the garage, his children came out to greet him, and that is when the missile struck.\n\n\"We lost 10 members of our family,\" Ismailzada said, including six children raging in age from 2 to 8. He said another relative, Naser Nejrabi, who was a former soldier in the Afghan army and a former interpreter for the U.S. military, also was killed, along with two teenagers.\n\nU.S. officials have acknowledged the reports of civilian casualties without confirming them.\n\nHours before the withdrawal was complete, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the U.S. military takes steps to avoid civilian casualties when carrying out targeted strikes.\n\n\"Of course, the loss of life from anywhere is horrible, and it impacts families no matter where they're living, in the United States or around the world,\" she said.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nThe last U.S. military planes departed Afghanistan around midnight Monday (Kabul time), completing the withdrawal.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Groups in China and South Korea have also raised concern, making it a political and diplomatic issue.\n\nBut the Japanese government and TEPCO say the water must be released to make room for the plant's decommissioning and to prevent accidental leaks. They say the treatment and dilution will make the wastewater safer than international standards and its environmental impact will be negligibly small. But some scientists say long-term impact of the low-dose radioactivity that remains in the water needs attention.\n\nThe water release begins more than 12 years after the March 2011 nuclear meltdowns, caused by a massive earthquake and tsunami. It marks a milestone for the plant's battle with an ever-growing radioactive water stockpile that TEPCO and the government say have hampered the daunting task of removing the fatally toxic melted debris from the reactors.\n\nThe pump activated Thursday afternoon would send the first batch of the diluted, treated water from a mixing pool to a secondary pool, where the water is then discharged into the ocean through an undersea tunnel. The water is collected and partly recycled as cooling water after treatment, with the rest stored in around 1,000 tanks, which are already filled to 98% of their 1.37-million-ton capacity.\n\nThose tanks, which cover much of the plant complex, must be freed up to build the new facilities needed for the decommissioning process, officials said.\n\nPrime Minister Fumio Kishida said it is indispensable and and cannot be postponed. He noted an experimental removal of a small amount of the melted debris from the No. 2 reactor is set for later this year using a remote-controlled giant robotic arm.\n\nTEPCO executive Junichi Matsumoto said Thursday's release was to begin with the least radioactive water to ensure safety.\n\nFinal preparation for the release began Tuesday, when just one ton of treated water was sent from a tank for dilution with 1,200 tons of seawater, and the mixture was kept in the primary pool for two days for final sampling to ensure safety, Matsumoto said. A batch of 460 tons was to be sent to the mixing pool Thursday for the actual discharge.\n\nBut Fukushima's fisheries, tourism and economy — which are still recovering from the disaster — worry the release could be the beginning of a new hardship.\n\nFukushima's current fish catch is only about one-fifth its pre-disaster level, in part due to a decline in the fishing population. China has tightened radiation testing on Japanese products from Fukushima and nine other prefectures, halting exports at customs for weeks, Fisheries Agency officials said.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nTEPCO began releasing the first batch of treated radioactive water into the Pacific Ocean.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA. Fishermen, including Haruo Ono, sued the Japanese government to stop the water release.\nB. The Chinese government criticized Japan’s plan to release wastewater.\nC. South Korea banned seafood imports from the Fukushima area.\nD.

But they said Musk is in charge of the social media platform and has fired CEO Parag Agrawal, CFO Ned Segal and Chief Legal Counsel Vijaya Gadde. Neither person wanted to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the deal.\n\nThe departures come just hours before a deadline set by a Delaware judge to finalize the deal on Friday. She threatened to schedule a trial if no agreement was reached.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAlthough they came quickly, the major personnel moves had been widely expected and almost certainly are the first of many major changes the mercurial Tesla CEO will make.\n\nMusk privately clashed with Agrawal in April, immediately before deciding to make a bid for the company, according to text messages later revealed in court filings.\n\nAbout the same time, he used Twitter to criticize Gadde, the company's top lawyer. His tweets were followed by a wave of harassment of Gadde from other Twitter accounts. For Gadde, an 11-year Twitter employee who also heads public policy and safety, the harassment included racist and misogynistic attacks, in addition to calls for Musk to fire her. On Thursday, after she was fired, the harassing tweets lit up once again.\n\nMusk's changes will be aimed at increasing Twitter's subscriber base and revenue.\n\nIn his first big move earlier on Thursday, Musk tried to soothe leery Twitter advertisers saying that he is buying the platform to help humanity and doesn't want it to become a \"free-for-all hellscape.\"\n\nThe message appeared to be aimed at addressing concerns among advertisers — Twitter's chief source of revenue — that Musk's plans to promote free speech by cutting back on moderating content will open the floodgates to more online toxicity and drive away users.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"The reason I acquired Twitter is because it is important to the future of civilization to have a common digital town square, where a wide range of beliefs can be debated in a healthy manner, without resorting to violence,\" Musk wrote in an uncharacteristically long message for the Tesla CEO, who typically projects his thoughts in one-line tweets.\n\nHe continued: \"There is currently great danger that social media will splinter into far right wing and far left wing echo chambers that generate more hate and divide our society.\"\n\nMusk has previously expressed distaste for advertising and Twitter's dependence on it, suggesting more emphasis on other business models such as paid subscriptions that won't allow big corporations to dictate policy on how social media operates. But on Thursday, he assured advertisers he wants Twitter to be \"the most respected advertising platform in the world.\"\n\nThe note is a shift from Musk's position that Twitter is unfairly infringing on free speech rights by blocking misinformation or graphic content, said Pinar Yildirim, associate professor of marketing at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.\n\nBut it's also a realization that having no content moderation is bad for business, putting Twitter at risk of losing advertisers and subscribers, she said.\n\n\"You do not want a place where consumers just simply are bombarded with things they do not want to hear about, and the platform takes no responsibility,\" Yildirim said.\n\nMusk said Twitter should be \"warm and welcoming to all\" and enable users to choose the experience they want to have.\n\nFriday's deadline to close the deal was ordered by the Delaware Chancery Court in early October. It is the latest step in a battle that began in April with Musk signing a deal to acquire Twitter, then tried to back out of it, leading Twitter to sue the Tesla CEO to force him to go through with the acquisition. If the two sides don't meet Friday's deadline, the next step could be a November trial that could lead to a judge forcing Musk to complete the deal.\n\nBut Musk has been signaling that the deal is going through. He strolled into the company's San Francisco headquarters Wednesday carrying a porcelain sink, changed his Twitter profile to \"Chief Twit,\" and tweeted \"Entering Twitter HQ — let that sink in!\"\n\nAnd overnight the New York Stock Exchange notified investors that it will suspend trading in shares of Twitter before the opening bell Friday in anticipation of the company going private under Musk.\n\nMusk is expected to speak to Twitter employees directly Friday if the deal is finalized, according to an internal memo cited in several media outlets. Despite internal confusion and low morale tied to fears of layoffs or a dismantling of the company's culture and operations, Twitter leaders this week have at least outwardly welcomed Musk's arrival and messaging.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nTop sales executive Sarah Personette, the company's chief customer officer, said she had a \"great discussion\" with Musk on Wednesday and appeared to endorse his Thursday message to advertisers.\n\n\"Our continued commitment to brand safety for advertisers remains unchanged,\" Personette tweeted Thursday. \"Looking forward to the future!\"\n\nMusk's apparent enthusiasm about visiting Twitter headquarters this week stood in sharp contrast to one of his earlier suggestions: The building should be turned into a homeless shelter because so few employees actually worked there.\n\nThe Washington Post reported last week that Musk told prospective investors that he plans to cut three quarters of Twitter's 7,500 workers when he becomes owner of the company. The newspaper cited documents and unnamed sources familiar with the deliberation.\n\nMusk has spent months deriding Twitter's \"spam bots\" and making sometimes contradictory pronouncements about Twitter's problems and how to fix them. But he has shared few concrete details about his plans for the social media platform.\n\nThursday's note to advertisers shows a newfound emphasis on advertising revenue, especially a need for Twitter to provide more \"relevant ads\" — which typically means targeted ads that rely on collecting and analyzing users' personal information.\n\nYildirim said that, unlike Facebook, Twitter has not been good at targeting advertising to what users want to see. Musk's message suggests he wants to fix that, she said.\n\nInsider Intelligence principal analyst Jasmine Enberg said Musk has good reason to avoid a massive shakeup of Twitter's ad business because Twitter's revenues have taken a beating from the weakening economy, months of uncertainty surrounding Musk's proposed takeover, changing consumer behaviors and the fact that \"there's no other revenue source waiting in the wings.\"\n\n\"Even slightly loosening content moderation on the platform is sure to spook advertisers, many of whom already find Twitter's brand safety tools to be lacking compared with other social platforms,\" Enberg said.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nMusk reinstated former President Donald Trump's Twitter account.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA. Elon Musk completed his $44 billion takeover of Twitter.\nB. Twitter sued Elon Musk to force the acquisition.\nC.

I can’t find the words to describe my frustration,” said Kim Hyo-lim, 23, after the motion failed. “I am devastated, but I feel honored to be a part of this historic moment for my country.”\n\nAs the rally kicked off in the afternoon, the atmosphere was festive. Many parents brought along their young children.\n\nLee Soo-young, 38, pushed her 2-year-old son in a stroller. “I don’t want him to live in a country that could be under martial law again,” she said.\n\nOver the next few hours, the crowds swelled, even as night fell and the temperature dropped. Seoul’s subway operator closed three nearby stations, yet people continued to flow in, filling several blocks and intersections. Many people held candles or colorful light sticks. They carried blankets to bundle up against the temperatures, which have hovered near freezing all week. Chants and music could be heard from blocks away.\n\nOrganizers used Facebook to arrange cross-country transportation: shuttle buses from cities hours away from Seoul and even plane rides from Jeju, an island off the southern coast. On X, people shared names that protesters could give at nearby cafes to get free drinks.\n\nWhile most of the attention was on the crowds outside the National Assembly, in another part of Seoul, a much smaller group of Mr. Yoon’s supporters gathered in one of the city’s main plazas. Mr. Yoon’s low approval rating plunged further this week. But thousands of his supporters sang anthems and waved South Korean and U.S. flags on Saturday.\n\nDemonstrators there did not want to talk about the short-lived martial law. Instead, person after person criticized the leader of the main opposition party, Lee Jae-myung, calling him a communist, and said Mr. Yoon was protecting the country from communism and preserving its relationship with the United States.\n\nWhile the crowd supporting Mr. Yoon was predominantly older, outside the National Assembly, many were protesting for the first time.\n\nAmong them was An Ye-young, 19, who said her parents disagreed with her politically. “For many of us who don’t usually pay attention to politics, and have just turned old enough to vote, there’s been a wake-up call to become more aware,” she said.\n\nThe night martial law was imposed, Ms. An couldn’t sleep. She rewatched “A Taxi Driver,” the South Korean film about the uprising against martial law in Gwangju in May 1980. “When I saw the scenes where citizens raised their voices,” she said, “I thought I should go and protest.”\n\nChang W.

Most had been isolating for months as the coronavirus pandemic took hold.\n\nBut the death of yet another Black person at the hands of police seemed to shatter a dam in the American conscious.\n\nProtesters march from Lafayette Square to the US Capitol on May 29, 2020, to protest George Floyd's murder earlier that week. Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe 7-acre green space just north of the White House, known as Lafayette Square, had been a rallying place for change for more than a century, from women’s suffrage marches in 1917 to the fight for racial equality and gay rights half a century later.\n\nAnd so it was where protesters gathered to mourn the death of this 46-year-old father, George Floyd.\n\nFor Thomas, standing among the thousands of Americans of all races and faiths and demanding racial equality changed the way she thought about criminal justice and her role as a pastor serving a nearby church.\n\nIt was “this cathartic release, this need to demonstrate, to protest, to yell and to not hold the grief that this had triggered,” she said.\n\nAs the crowd chanted the names of Black lives lost to police violence – Tamir Rice, Sandra Bland, Eric Garner, Breonna Taylor – it began to feel to Thomas like a prayer.\n\n“That was a holy experience for me that is unmatched,” she said.\n\nThe daytime demonstrations were largely peaceful.\n\nBut as night fell on Washington – and other American cities – their tone changed.\n\nProtesters confront police on May 30, 2020.

Eric Baradat/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAfter nights of clashes, then-President Donald Trump, known for issuing directives and invectives through social media, fired off a series of posts shortly before 1 a.m. on Friday, May 29, 2020.\n\nHe condemned protests in Minneapolis that had become violent.\n\n“These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd,” he wrote before pivoting to a stark ultimatum:\n\n“Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts.”\n\nOutside the White House that evening, people began throwing rocks. Some tried to topple police barricades. The Secret Service rushed Trump and his family to the executive mansion’s bunker.\n\n“Nobody came close to breaching the fence,” Trump posted the following day. “If they had, they would have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen.”\n\nTrump’s allusions to police brutality – the very thing demonstrators were protesting – only seemed to rile them and underscore what was at stake.\n\nIt was also prescient.\n\nDemonstrations kept swelling through the weekend. Offices and other buildings around Lafayette Square were boarded up. But it didn’t stop the destruction.\n\nCrews board up buildings May 31, 2020, near the White House. Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images\n\nThe windows of Michelle Brown and Linda Neumann’s tea shop by the White House were smashed and the café set on fire, they told an influential city magazine. Even so, Brown quickly took to social media to underscore her support for those peacefully demanding change:\n\n“Before anyone puts a single word in our mouths,” she wrote: “Black lives matter.”\n\n“There’s insurance to cover things like this,” Neumann told the magazine. “We are both just so sad and heartbroken about what’s happening in the country and how things came to this.”\n\nThen, late Sunday night, an arsonist set fire to the basement of St. John’s Church, a landmark crowning the top of Lafayette Square and often referred to as the “presidents church” because so many have worshipped there.\n\nThe physical damage was minimal. But the flames ignited a series of events that soon would alter the landscape of the district itself.\n\nA man is injured during a May 30, 2020, protest near the White House.

Eric Thayer/Reuters\n\nThe following day, officials in Hennepin County, Minnesota, ruled Floyd’s death a homicide, codifying what many already sensed:\n\nFloyd’s life had been taken, and someone should be held accountable.\n\nProtesters again gathered outside the White House. Only this time, they were met by police.\n\nThe law enforcement presence was subtle at first. Officers observed from the park as demonstrators waved signs and chanted, “Hands up, don’t shoot!” and “No Justice! No Peace.”\n\nBut as the day wore on, the police presence grew. Journalists noticed.\n\n“These protests until now have been entirely calm,” CNN correspondent Alex Marquardt told Wolf Blitzer.\n\nUS Park Police stand watch June 1, 2020, as demonstrators protest at Lafayette Square.

Hundreds of National Guard troops staged near the park. A line of mounted police officers towered above the protesters and kept watch.\n\nThe White House announced Trump would make a statement in the Rose Garden.\n\nThe officers, Marquardt said, began to pull on gas masks.\n\nIn seconds, things went from peaceful to pandemonium.\n\nCNN\n\nA woman cries out after being exposed to tear gas on June 1, 2020, near the White House.

People fell. Others took a knee before the advancing line of police.\n\nMany retreated toward St. John’s Church.\n\nAs police descended, Thomas thought of the 1965 civil rights march to Montgomery, Alabama, that saw a young activist named John Lewis beaten bloody on a bridge in Selma.\n\n“All that was missing was a water hose and some dogs,” she recalled. “We’re marching to advance a cause – to say you can’t just kill people without due process – and you’re pushing us back with violence.”\n\nTear gas canisters cracked like thunder, and flash bangs echoed across White House lawns. Somehow, the Rose Garden maintained a relative tranquility, and from it, Trump spoke to the American people.\n\n“I will fight to protect you. I am your president of law and order and an ally of all peaceful protesters,” he said as helicopters whirred.\n\nTrump called on mayors and governors across the country to “dominate the streets” and “establish an overwhelming law enforcement presence until the violence has been quelled.”\n\nThen, he left the stage and made his way across the park.\n\nStanding in front of the boarded-up St. John’s Church, the president posed with a Bible, holding it in the air.\n\n“We have a great country,” he told reporters.\n\nPresident Donald Trump walks on June 1, 2020, between lines of riot police toward St. John's Church. Tom Brenner/Reuters\n\nCNN\n\nIt wasn’t long before pundits launched debates over Trump’s sacred prop, critics argued about the use of active-duty military against Americans exercising First Amendment rights and politicians lined up to assign blame.\n\nIn the office of the mayor of Washington, DC, the response was quieter as officials moved into action to make clear to the world – and the president living down the street – the city’s undisputed stance on the moral moment gripping the nation.\n\nFirst, they called Keyonna Jones.\n\nAn artist born and raised in Southeast DC, Jones – like many Americans – had been struggling to reconcile her own struggles in the pandemic with the injustice of Floyd’s death, she said.\n\nAll the same, she answered the phone. And in less than 24 hours, she was across town on 16th Street NW.\n\nWith an army of volunteers, friends, neighbors and municipal workers, Jones began to emblazon the two blocks leading directly to the White House with 50-foot letters that spelled out the moment’s words of empowerment so indelibly, they could be seen from space:\n\nA satellite photo shows the new plaza in June 2020. Maxar Technologies/Reuters\n\nOn June 5 – just 11 days after Floyd took his last breath – the district officially unveiled Black Lives Matter Plaza. The date happened to coincide with the birthday of Breonna Taylor, the Black American whose life had been cut tragically short that March in an encounter with police.\n\n“We know what’s going on in our country,” Mayor Muriel Bowser said. “We had the opportunity to send that message loud and clear on a very important street in our city … And that message is to the American people that Black Lives Matter, that Black humanity matters, and we as a city raise that up as part of our values.”\n\nKeyonna Jones\n\nCNN\n\nOther cities followed suit. In Montgomery, Alabama, the phrase marked the spot where enslaved people once were auctioned. In Tulsa, Oklahoma, the same kind of yellow letters were painted along Greenwood Avenue in homage to the lives stolen in the 1921 Race Massacre. New York commissioned a mural along 5th Avenue, just outside Trump Tower. More murals appeared in Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom.\n\nThey often were spurned. Many were vandalized. And some people, including Trump, saw them as divisive. He called Manhattan’s mural a “symbol of hate.”\n\nEven some within the Black Lives Matter movement declared the murals “performative,” an attempt by public officials to absolve themselves of the immensely hard work of rooting out systemic racism.\n\n“I think art is part of activism,” countered Jones, the artist. “It’s a universal language – people will see it, people will feel it and it’s starting a conversation that may not have happened.”\n\nNew York's Black Lives Matter street mural is vandalized on August 23, 2020, in a counter-protest outside Trump Tower.

The 80-year-old was battling pancreatic cancer, but he was determined to see the mural in person, a spokesperson said.\n\nForty days later, he died.\n\nThe district the following year spent millions making the mural a permanent installation, replacing traditional asphalt with colored pavers to spell out its eponymous phrase. The goal, the mayor said, was to transform “the mural into a monument.”\n\nIn its quieter moments, the public art acted as a beacon, calling on Americans – together – to mourn, celebrate, argue, strategize and reflect on the ongoing fight against racism in the United States and the nation’s commitment to equality.\n\nAnd, sure enough, it outlasted the pandemic. And the trial and conviction of Floyd’s murderer. And the entire Biden administration. And Trump’s return this year to the White House.\n\nThousands gather on November 7, 2020, at Black Lives Matter Plaza in Washington to celebrate Joe Biden's electoral victory.

That doesn’t make sense.”\n\nAs Thomas watched the construction crews and excavators, she felt gutted and angry. In the nearly five years since Floyd’s death, she’d opted against preaching from the pulpit and instead ministered directly to activists and advocates leading protest movements across the country.\n\nWitnessing the ordered destruction, she wondered: “Are you thinking if you dig this up … you can just erase what we’ve done here?”\n\nCNN\n\nThen, in full view of the workers, Thomas picked up a chunk of the mural and walked away.\n\nIt was “an act of defiance, an act of resistance,” she said. “You can’t erase memory. You can’t erase conviction.”\n\nJones felt much the same way. Five years after her artwork drew global attention, the United States has seemingly returned to its status quo, she said, with conversations about – and, more importantly, actions toward – racial equality fading again into the background.\n\nStill, the artist said, her father recently reminded her of a speech by the Rev. Jesse Jackson, the civil rights leader who rushed to but could not save a dying Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nIn the speech, Jackson invoked the biblical boy David who fells the giant Goliath and encouraged Americans to continue to fight systems of injustice and not to be brought down by the “margin of despair.”\n\n“We have to recognize that we’re Davids,” Jones said. “There are rocks laying around that we can use to defeat the system.”\n\nWe just have to pick them up.\n\nTears roll down the face of Starlette Thomas on March 10 as she holds a chunk of pavement from the Black Lives Matter Plaza mural.

Britons have criticized the EU for its handling of a range of issues, resent the loss of power to the Brussels-based institution and are divided among themselves about the institution they first joined in 1973.\n\nMore broadly, a Pew Research Center survey conducted this spring found that publics in a number of other EU countries share the British desire for a less, not more, centralized Europe, and that the debate about the future of the EU will not subside just because the UK has now voted.\n\nThe EU has never been as popular in the UK as it has been among other EU members. Just 44% of the public in the UK has a favorable view of the EU, compared with a median of 50% who hold a favorable opinion in five other EU nations surveyed by Pew Research Center. Support for the EU is down in the UK from a high of 52% in 2014. British views of the EU have consistently been lower than those on the continent for nearly a decade.\n\nThe British have long thought that the EU was inefficient and intrusive and has mishandled the challenges facing Europe. In a 2014 Pew Research Center survey, 64% of the British thought the EU was inefficient and does not understand the needs of its citizens. Six-in-ten said it was intrusive. In this year’s survey, 70% in the UK disapprove of the EU’s handling of the refugee issue and 55% said the same about the EU’s dealing with economic issues.\n\nThe vote to leave reflects the desire of nearly two-thirds of the UK public to bring back some EU powers from Brussels to London. Fully 65% of the British said before the referendum that they wanted some EU powers to be returned to their national government. This included 73% of those ages 50 and older, 70% of men, 68% of those with a secondary education or less, 93% of UK Independence Party supporters, 77% of Conservative Party adherents and 49% of Labour Party backers.\n\nThe Brexit vote exposes a rift in public opinion between the Scottish and people in the rest of the United Kingdom. The Scottish voted to stay in the EU by an overwhelming margin of 62% to 38%, putting a new Scottish independence referendum on the table. Pew Research Center data show that the Scottish are more likely than those in England, Northern Ireland and Wales to have a favorable opinion of the EU (53% versus 43% respectively).\n\nScotland also disagrees with the rest of the UK on two issues central to the Brexit debate: the economy and immigration. The Scottish feel more threatened by the prospect of global economic instability than their counterparts in the rest of the UK. Roughly six-in-ten say it is a major threat to their country, while only 48% say the same in England, Northern Ireland and Wales. Meanwhile, the rest of the UK feels more threatened by the large number of refugees leaving countries such as Iraq and Syria (54% major threat). Just 41% of Scottish people agree.\n\nThe rest of Europe sees Brexit as pivotal for the well-being of the EU. Before the referendum, a median of 70% said that they thought it would be a bad thing for the EU if the UK were to leave. This included 89% of the Swedes, 75% of the Dutch and 74% of the Germans.\n\nThe debate in other EU member states about the future of the institution may just be getting started. A majority of the Greeks (68%) and pluralities of the Dutch (44%), Germans (43%), Italians (39%) and French (39%) all want some EU power returned to their national governments. Both the Dutch and the French have a history of holding referendums on major and not-so-major issues, and Euroskeptic parties in both countries have already voiced support for a public vote on their relationship with the EU.\n\nNOTE (April 2017): After publication, the weight for the Netherlands data was revised to correct percentages for two regions. The impact of this revision on the Netherlands data included in this blog post is very minor and does not materially change the analysis. For a summary of changes, see here.

From New York to Wuhan, attention and resources are being directed to fight the spread of COVID-19, a disease caused by the novel coronavirus (officially, SARS-CoV-2). On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared the situation a pandemic.[1] Healthcare systems in even the most advanced countries are being overwhelmed. As the pandemic[2] spreads, the coronavirus will disproportionately impact the world’s most vulnerable, among them refugees, asylum seekers, and internally displaced people (IDPs). These populations must be included in the global response to the virus. This is essential to protecting not only these communities, but societies at large.\n\nThe scale and speed of the pandemic underscore how deeply interconnected the world’s populations are. Nevertheless, at precisely the moment when global solidarity and cooperation are essential, many nations are turning inward as they seek to protect their citizens. But a virus does not respect borders. Nor does it discriminate. A truly effective response, not to mention a morally correct one, also must not discriminate.\n\n“A virus does not respect borders. Nor does it discriminate. A truly effective response, not to mention a morally correct one, also must not discriminate.”\n\nThe world’s more than 70 million forcibly displaced people—including refugees, asylum seekers, IDPs, and other forced migrants—are among the most vulnerable. Already, their displacement leaves them disadvantaged in many ways. The impact of the epidemic both exacerbates and is exacerbated by the conditions in which they live. A series of factors make them extremely vulnerable to the spread of the virus.\n\nThe first factor is population density. Many refugees and internally displaced people live in cramped conditions, including formal camps, informal settlements, or population-dense urban spaces. Multiple families are often forced to share the same bathroom, the same cooking, and the same bathing facilities – if they have access at all. Some are forced to share the same tent. In some countries, asylum seekers and irregular migrants are placed in detention, often in appalling conditions. The ease with which the coronavirus spreads makes these living situations potentially disastrous.\n\nSecond, the forcibly displaced generally have difficulty accessing basic services—especially healthcare. When they have access, it tends to be to primary healthcare. Intensive care – the kind of care that COVID-19 patients need when they develop acute respiratory distress syndrome – is scarce to nonexistent, especially in camp settings. In addition, those fleeing conflict or natural disasters often struggle with underlying health conditions, including malnutrition, psychosocial stress, and other infectious diseases like TB. These conditions make them more vulnerable to the virus.\n\nThird, the limited access to reliable information for displaced communities will complicate efforts to respond. Misinformation, mistrust of authorities, the absence of communication networks, and language barriers can all prevent accurate and far-reaching messaging. Without critical information about the coronavirus, the displaced may not only risk spreading the infection, but find themselves in violation of new policies. At risk of deportation, asylum seekers without legal status are often reticent to trust local authorities, much less reveal themselves once they get sick.\n\nFourth, the humanitarian supply chain may be challenged by the outbreak. Relief workers may reduce or cut contact with displaced communities to help prevent spread of the virus. Many humanitarian actors will not have the training or resources to respond to such an unprecedented crisis. Governments are restricting the travel of international personnel and the movement of vital supplies. Steps to close borders, halt transportation, and shutter businesses are interrupting supply. The resulting shortages of goods could have devastating consequences in many humanitarian contexts.\n\nFinally, as governments, NGOs, and international organizations redirect their attention and resources to combat the pandemic, the financing needed to respond to ongoing humanitarian and displacement crises is at risk of falling dramatically. Already, responses to many of these crises are acutely underfunded. The lasting economic impact of the pandemic on the global economy will only aggravate this problem just as aid agencies find themselves increasingly overwhelmed.\n\nCertainly, many of the challenges that displaced people face will be shared by vulnerable and marginalized citizens in every country affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, we must recognize the unique circumstances of refugees, asylum seekers, IDPs, and other forced migrants in light of the threat an outbreak presents. What follows is a snapshot of how these and other issues are playing out across major humanitarian and displacement crises. The information and analysis in this report reveal key principles and recommendations that should be part of any effective humanitarian response to the pandemic.\n\nAsia\n\nChina was the original epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic. The outbreak of COVID-19 there raised concerns that the virus would spread to other parts of the region, including to south Asia—home to some of the world’s largest populations of refugees and IDPs. Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh, Afghan refugees in Pakistan, and millions of IDPs inside Afghanistan itself shelter in overcrowded and underserved camps and informal settlements. The coronavirus has the potential to wreak havoc in these settings.\n\nAfghan Refugees and Internally Displaced People\n\nAlmost 40 years of conflict have forcibly displaced huge numbers of Afghans. Millions have fled the country and are living in neighboring countries such as Iran, representing one of the largest protracted refugee situations in the world. Iran is a hotbed for COVID-19, now reporting the fourth highest number of deaths in the world.[3] The Iranian government faced criticism for its delay in acknowledging and responding to the seriousness of the outbreak.[4] Not until March 26—with 29,406 cases confirmed and 2,234 deaths—did the government issue an intercity travel ban and close schools, universities, national parks, and non-essential businesses.[5][6] For the more than 3 million Afghans living in Iran, the situation is most dire. Most had difficulty accessing basic services like healthcare even before the current outbreak. Tens of thousands are returning to Afghanistan.\n\nHowever, decades of war have devastated the health system in Afghanistan. Although more than 420 new health facilities have been established since 2014, the healthcare sector remains vastly under resourced.[7] There are approximately three doctors for every 10,000 patients.[8] While Afghanistan is in the midst of fragile peace negotiations, the level of violence remains remarkably high and the population’s humanitarian needs are massive. More than 2.5 million Afghans are internally displaced. Of the 120 COVID-19 cases that have been confirmed in Afghanistan,[9] a significant number had recently come from Iran.[10] They had entered through the city of Herat, where there is no health facility adequately equipped to deal with this illness. Government officials have recommended social distancing measures and even instituted a daytime curfew in Herat, but their recommendations have largely gone unheeded. On March 24, Afghanistan’s health ministry warned that half of the country’s almost 39 million people might be infected.[11]\n\nRohingya Refugees\n\nHealth authorities in Bangladesh are gearing up for a possible COVID-19 outbreak in Rohingya refugee camps. There are nearly 900,000 refugees living in the camps in Cox’s Bazar and more than 400,000 Bangladeshis living in close proximity to them. Cramped living conditions, poor water quality, and patchy access to healthcare in the camps leave refugees vulnerable to disease. A recent humanitarian risk assessment of the Rohingya response warned, “the potential mortality and morbidity risk associated with COVID-19 is likely to surpass global averages.”[12]\n\n“Cramped living conditions, poor water quality, and patchy access to healthcare in the camps leave refugees vulnerable to disease.”\n\nBangladesh’s Ministry of Health is developing a preparedness and response plan in coordination with UN agencies. Hundreds of health workers in the camp area are receiving training to improve disease outbreak detection and prevention.[13] However, UN officials privately warn that they anticipate major problems in managing the spread of the virus inside their own international workforce, much less across the refugee population. The government of Bangladesh is allowing only essential services to reach the camps, undermining efforts to address food insecurity and cyclone preparedness. Meanwhile, health workers there lack personal protective equipment such as gloves and masks. Donors and UN agencies must step up to supply these critical items.\n\nCommunicating with displaced populations about the COVID-19 outbreak will be challenging given refugees’ mistrust of authorities and the absence of formal, credible communications networks. The government continues to restrict phone and internet access in the camps while rumors and false information often spread quickly. This is likely to hinder efforts to prevent and prepare for the spread of the virus. The government of Bangladesh should therefore lift internet and phone restrictions and empower Rohingya civil society organizations that have formed in the camps in order to improve the quality and reach of essential information.[14]\n\nRohingya refugees living in the mega-camp in Bangladesh.

In many cases, this has meant blocking all incoming flights or screening and quarantining passengers of certain nationalities or arriving from specific countries. Though perhaps effective in combating the disease’s spread, these measures have also prevented the delivery of much-needed humanitarian staff and cargo to respond to ongoing crises in these countries. The potential resulting shortages of goods and technical capacity could have devastating consequences in many humanitarian contexts across the continent, where there are more than 17.7 million IDPs and over 6.3 million refugees.\n\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 could also undermine critical peacekeeping efforts in sub-Saharan Africa. Many countries that contribute troops to the United Nations (UN) peacekeeping missions are experiencing outbreaks of the novel coronavirus. As a result, and in order to curb the spread of the disease, the UN recently requested that nine troop-contributing countries delay the regular rotation of their soldiers in and out of peacekeeping missions.[15] In some cases, this could require currently deployed troops to stay in place. The pause in rotations could also lead to continued gaps in critical mission capability. Africa will be disproportionately impacted, as seven of these UN peacekeeping missions operate in conflict and humanitarian crisis zones across the continent.\n\nThe Horn of Africa\n\nEven before the outbreak of COVID-19, countries in the Horn of Africa were grappling with long-standing instability; conflict and the threat of terrorism; and the exacerbating impact of climate change and locust swarms on severe food insecurity. Now, they have registered their first cases of COVID-19—as of March 29, Somalia had three, Ethiopia had 19, and Kenya had 38 confirmed cases.[16] Kenya also confirmed its first death—a 66-year-old Kenyan man who also suffered from diabetes.[17] Meanwhile, the region is home to approximately 5.3 million IDPs and 2.5 million refugees, who are likely to be hit hardest.[18]\n\nAbsent robust public education campaigns about the coronavirus, rumors and false information are spreading rapidly. Fast and accurate information is critical in areas where the health infrastructure is weak and does not have the capacity to face an outbreak. In Ethiopia, which is host to more than 900,000 refugees and more than 2.6 million IDPs,[19] popular sentiment has violently turned against foreigners, who are being blamed for spreading the disease.[20] In Ethiopia’s western Oromia region—where intercommunal violence has displaced thousands—a months-long government-imposed shutdown of phone and internet services is further restricting the ability to provide information on the virus.[21] In addition to limiting information on COVID-19, this inhibits communication among families, doctors, and their patients.\n\nHealth experts are concerned that the outbreak in Somalia, with an IDP population of more than 2.6 million and more than 16,000 refugees, could be among the worst in the world.[22] Decades of conflict have ravaged the country’s health system and other institutions and governance is weak. Al-Shabaab, an Islamic militant group affiliated with al-Qaeda, controls large swaths of territory, limiting the state’s reach and humanitarian workers’ access to populations in need.[23] Because there are no kits to test for COVID-19 in the country, samples must be sent to South Africa for analysis, significantly delaying results and thus the ability to track the disease.[24]\n\nThe government in Somalia has halted international flights, closed schools, and prohibited large public gatherings, but the measures are not well-enforced.[25] To date, Al-Shabaab does not appear to have implemented measures in the regions it controls. Meanwhile, Somalia’s sizable displaced population is particularly at risk.[26] Humanitarian workers warn that the consequences could be devastating for the 3,000 families living in Nabadoon camp, outside Somalia’s capital of Mogadishu.[27] There, a lack of access to clean water, healthcare, and information, as well as cramped living conditions, will facilitate the spread of disease should an outbreak occur. In addition, continued conflict will complicate efforts to reach affected populations as the virus spreads.\n\nCentral Africa\n\nNigeria, where over 2 million people are internally displaced in the country’s northeast, was the first central African state to report cases of the virus. As of March 29, there were 97 confirmed cases of COVID-19.[28] Neighboring Cameroon had confirmed 91 cases, as it grapples with a series of crises that have forced 922,000 of its citizens into internal displacement.[29] Both governments have more capacity than many of their neighbors and could play a leadership role in responding to the pandemic. The Nigerian government should be applauded for working with UN leadership in the country to coordinate response efforts there. Unfortunately, other governments across the region have not done likewise.\n\nCountries like Chad and the Central African Republic (CAR) were reporting three cases in each country as of March 29; however, given the limitations of their health systems, it is uncertain if these are indicative of the actual trend.[30] The outbreak’s impact could be disastrous if the coronavirus spreads beyond the capital cities, especially for the displaced populations in both countries. There are more than half a million IDPs in CAR and 171,000 IDPs in Chad, as well as 468,000 refugees from neighboring countries.[31] These vulnerable populations have little access to clean water or healthcare facilities.\n\nMen stand outside a house in a district that welcomes internally displaced people (IDP) from northern Burkina Faso.

The coronavirus has the potential to put immense pressure on already strained national health services and healthcare provided by humanitarian actors. The situation in Burkina Faso provides a window into the nature of the challenge that could confront neighboring Mali and Niger. There are currently 207 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Burkina Faso. Eleven deaths have been reported, including that of Marie Rose Compaore, the second vice-president of the National Assembly. It is only a matter of time before the disease spreads to the country’s more than half a million IDPs.[32]\n\nAs of March 29, Mali and Niger had both reported 18 cases of COVID-19. However, the lack of infrastructure in both countries prevents both the effective detection and containment of the disease. Moreover, the internally displaced populations in both countries—171,000 people in Mali, and 187,000 in Niger—are not in camps and frequently relocate because of spreading violence.[33] This could increase the likelihood of the virus reaching them and other groups on the move.\n\nAcross the region, humanitarian funding is in short supply and displaced populations already lacks access to health services, water, and sanitation. Basic measures recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and World Health Organization—such as stringent hand washing with soap and water and social distancing—are largely impractical in this context. The UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) had planned to host a donor conference for the Sahel in mid-June to secure badly needed funding for the emergency. However, the conference has now been postponed because of COVID-19.\n\nThe Democratic Republic of Congo\n\nIn the Great Lakes Region, 30 people in Uganda, 60 in Rwanda, and 65 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) had tested positive for COVID-19 as of March 29, 2020.[34] With over 5 million displaced persons (the vast majority of whom are IDPs), the DRC has the largest number of displaced people in the region.[35] The first week of March 2020 marked the end of the DRC’s two-year-long Ebola outbreak. But the celebrations were cut short by the arrival of the novel coronavirus. As the DRC grapples with the spread of this new pandemic, it is important that health facilities built to respond to the Ebola outbreak be repurposed to treat cases of COVID-19. While discussions to that effect have already begun, very little action has been taken. NGOs are beginning to integrate messaging about the coronavirus into their current programs. However, planning and implementation must be accelerated.\n\nSouth Sudan\n\nFollowing years of civil war, nearly one-third of South Sudan’s population remains displaced—there are about 1.47 million IDPs in South Sudan and 2.2 million refugees in neighboring countries.[36] With more than half the population facing acute food insecurity and poor health infrastructure, South Sudan is highly vulnerable to the spread and harmful effects of infectious diseases. No cases of COVID-19 had been reported in the country as of publication of this report, but several cases had been confirmed in neighboring countries. To prevent and prepare for a possible outbreak, South Sudan has suspended all international flights and locked down its land borders to all but cargo buses, food trucks, and fuel tanks.[37]\n\nThe presence of a large UN peacekeeping mission with significant staff rotations in South Sudan adds an additional potential vector for the disease to spread to the country. Almost 200,000 IDPs live in Protection of Civilian sites on or near peacekeeping bases.[38] The UN and troop contributing countries are taking steps to limit the potential for exposure, including a temporary freeze on staff travel into South Sudan.[39]\n\nThe Americas\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has already had significant implications for major humanitarian hotspots across the Americas. To date, the response by governments has varied widely. Countries like Peru, Guatemala, and Colombia implemented strong measures early to combat the spread of the virus.[40] However, Mexico and Brazil have been slow to adopt mitigation measures, even dismissing the severity of the crisis.[41] In Central America, many countries have adopted stricter border policies but have acquiesced to demands from the United States to continue receiving deported nationals. Many countries in South America have closed their borders to the movement of people, including for displaced Venezuelans.\n\nThe U.S. Border\n\nThe United States now leads the world in confirmed coronavirus cases.[42] Before the outbreak of COVID-19, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) had returned over 60,000 asylum seekers to northern Mexico to await their U.S. immigration court dates there. This was done under the Trump administration’s Migration Protection Protocols (MPP), known as the “Remain in Mexico” program.[43] These asylum seekers—mostly from Central America, Cuba, and Venezuela—were returned to unsafe conditions in Mexico, and left to await their hearings in ill-equipped shelters and informal open-air encampments where disease could spread rapidly. In addition, there were 15,000 individuals waiting to seek asylum outside U.S. ports of entry as of February 2020. These individuals—three quarters of whom are Mexican—were living in the same grim conditions as those impacted by the MPP program.[44]\n\nOn March 21, the U.S. government mandated port and border closures in response to the pandemic. No exceptions are being made for asylum seekers or unaccompanied minors. The border closure empowers DHS to immediately turn back to Mexico or repatriate to their home countries other than Mexico all asylum seekers without due process—a clear violation of U.S. obligations under domestic and international law.[45] These measures were instituted well after introduction of the virus to the United States. They have impeded the ability of humanitarian workers to bring critical supplies to Mexico. In addition, some of the shelters housing asylum seekers on the Mexican side of the border have been forced to close because of the virus.[46]\n\nAs a result of the border closures, the United States has already begun to turn away or repatriate all migrants lacking documents authorizing their entry—including asylum seekers and unaccompanied minors—to countries including Mexico,[47] Guatemala,[48] Honduras,[49] and Ecuador. Authorities are not screening individuals to determine if they are victims of human trafficking or have credible fears of persecution in their home countries. Nor are they taking precautions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. The Mexican government has agreed to accept most Central American returnees (though not unaccompanied minors).[50] It is not clear if the United States or Mexico intends to arrange the deportation of others, such as Venezuelans or Cubans, in lieu of allowing them to seek asylum in the United States.\n\nMoreover, many of the NGOs that typically play a crucial monitoring role at the U.S. border have been forced to reduce or cease operations in light of efforts to reduce the spread of COVID-19 within the United States. This makes it crucial that the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) monitor returns and conditions along the border. Despite U.S. government restrictions on travel and commerce, the delivery of critical humanitarian supplies to Mexico should be considered “essential” and allowed to continue.\n\nThe rule closing the border is predicated on the false assumption that the only possible alternative to turning away asylum seekers is detaining them in unsafe, overcrowded border facilities for lengthy periods of time. In fact, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agency could instead expeditiously parole asylum seekers into the United States, where the vast majority have ties to families, friends, or faith-based communities.[51] In the weeks ahead, U.S. border officials should allow people to follow the U.S. legal process to request asylum and provide screening and referral to health facilities if necessary. Asylum seekers should then be released to homes and NGO-run shelters, through parole or other community-based alternatives to detention, where they can appropriately socially distance and be permitted to continue their cases in immigration court when the courts resume operations.[52] CBP should screen unaccompanied minors and send then to the Office of Refugee Resettlement which must, according to a new court order, quickly plan to release them to sponsors.[53]\n\nMexico\n\nMexico is both a transit and destination country for displaced people. Asylum seekers and other forced migrants come primarily from Central America, but also from South America and Africa. They are often at higher risk of exposure to the coronavirus because of their living conditions. Many are detained in detention centers known as “migratory stations,” stay in privately-run shelters while they await their asylum claims in Mexico to be processed, or, as described above, live in informal camps on the northern border while they await their court hearings in the United States.\n\nMexico has 848 registered cases of COVID-19.[54] Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador was criticized for long ignoring the crisis, even traveling across the country and holding gatherings with large crowds. Now, the government has begun to take steps to contain the virus, such as calling for Mexicans to stay in their homes for a month[55] and limiting tourism.[56] It is also working to reduce overcrowding among the migrant and forcibly displaced populations in migratory stations across the country.[57] However, the government continues to accept the return of Mexicans deported from the United States despite inadequate health screenings prior to deportation. Grim conditions and the absence of healthcare and other services in the informal camps where they often stay are perhaps of greatest concern.\n\nThe Mexican authorities must more aggressively encourage practices to prevent the spread of the coronavirus and President López Obrador should lead by example. In migratory stations, specifically, Mexico’s National Migration Institute (INAMI) should continue to implement mitigation measures and reduce the number of detained migrants when possible, with support from independent civil society organizations. The Mexican government has indicated that it would suspend the processing of asylum requests until April 20. However, it should resume these operations as soon as possible. In the interim, Mexico should ensure that asylum seekers whose claims are on hold have access to adequate shelter and healthcare, including testing for COVID-19. Mexico should not be expected to accept asylum seekers returned under the MPP program until basic safeguards can be put in place to protect the health of returnees.\n\nCentral America\n\nThe countries of Central America grapple with extreme violence and lack institutional capacity to respond to a pandemic. Civilians eager to escape violence have no recourse, prevented from fleeing because of border closures. Meanwhile, hundreds of Central Americans are deported from the United States each week.\n\nGuatemala has confirmed 34 cases COVID-19.[58] On March 16, the government suspended all international flights and closed the borders for 15 days.[59] On March 17, it announced the temporary suspension of transfers of Hondurans and Salvadorans from the United States to Guatemala under the Asylum Cooperation Agreement (ACA). (The United States has used the ACA to bar asylum seekers from applying for protection in the United States, instead sending them to Guatemala.) The Guatemalan government initially announced that it would suspend the acceptance of Guatemalan nationals deported by the Unites States. However, it reversed this decision in a just a matter of days and deportations of Guatemalans have resumed. The Guatemalan government is warning its citizens that they will be immediately deported if they attempt to go to the United States.[60]\n\nIn El Salvador, President Nayib Bukele announced that the country would bar entry to all foreigners, except accredited diplomats and legal permanent residents. President Bukele announced the creation of a special hospital for patients with COVID-19 and called for a halt of deportations from Mexico and the United States on March 18.[61] Nonetheless, deportation flights to El Salvador have continued.[62] As of March 29, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras all received U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) air flights from the United States.[63]\n\nThe Guatemalan government should remain firm in its decision to halt transfers of asylum seekers under the ACA. Even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was unreasonable to forcibly send Salvadorans and Hondurans asylum seekers to a country, Guatemala, that cannot provide them with adequate safety and security. In cases of deportation of Guatemalan, Salvadoran, or Honduran migrants who have not made claims to asylum, the United States should adopt comprehensive screenings prior to departures to ensure safety of other deportees and to avoid overwhelming these countries’ fragile health systems during this public health crisis. Guatemalans, Salvadorans, and Hondurans who test positive should not be deported.\n\nThe Venezuela Crisis\n\nUnder the regime of President Nicolás Maduro, Venezuelans have suffered years of economic collapse, institutional failure, and political turmoil. Hyperinflation, generalized violence, and political repression are rife in a country where the vast majority live in poverty. In February 2020, the UN World Food Program stated that 9.3 million people in Venezuela—about one-third of the population—faced food insecurity.[64] As more than 4.9 million people have fled the country, over 1 million children have been left without their parents.[65]\n\nAs of March 29, 2020, there were 119 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Venezuela. Although World Health Organization records do not indicate any deaths, Venezuelan officials have confirmed at least one death.[66] A “social quarantine” has been established nation-wide, and military forces have been deployed throughout the country to enforce restrictions on movement. Nevertheless, not all citizens are complying, as small crowds continue to line up to obtain food and other essential goods. On March 24, the government ordered stricter isolation measures in the three states—Caracas, Miranda, and Vargas—that account for 70 percent of COVID-19 cases.[67] The country’s years-long economic crisis has left its health system and other institutions in complete collapse.[68] Hospitals lack adequate facilities, medical personnel, supplies, and medication.[69] For the public, face masks, soap, and even water for hand-washing[70] are either unavailable or unaffordable.[71]\n\nNicolás Maduro has called on the United States to lift its sanctions on the country in order to open access to foreign investments and finance that could help fund a response. Human rights groups, and EU leaders,[72] as well as the UN Secretary-General[73] and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights[74] have echoed these calls. On March 26, the United States indicted Maduro with narco-terrorism and other serious charges in a move it could use to justify additional sanctions.[75] Maduro also tried and failed to secure a $5 billion loan from a special emergency fund of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).[76] President Xi Jinping of China sent 4,000 diagnosis kits,[77] and Cuba sent a medical brigade to help.[78] Meanwhile, Maduro’s long-held opposition to international aid organizations will further heighten the likelihood that the outbreak does outsized damage.\n\nThe pandemic risks exacerbating the pre-existing humanitarian crisis inside Venezuela—a crisis that has already compelled millions from Venezuelans to seek refuge in other countries.[79] As the situation deteriorates, more Venezuelans are likely to try to flee to neighboring Colombia and Brazil. Faced with official border closings, they may instead resort to taking dangerous unofficial routes out of the country, known as trochas, that are often controlled by armed groups. Those who are able to cross irregularly will, in turn, have trouble accessing the care they need in their host countries, and thus risk further spreading the virus.\n\nVenezuelans in Colombia\n\nAs of March 29, the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 inside Colombia had risen to 608, with six deaths reported.[80] That day, after several temporary “quarantine drills” in parts of the country, a 19-day nation-wide lockdown went into effect.[81] As of March 17, the government had closed the country’s borders. Colombia is host to the largest number of displaced Venezuelans, by far—according to official reports, more than 1.7 million Venezuelans were in Colombia as of December 31, 2019. Since the start of the displacement crisis, the Colombian government has maintained a relatively generous response.[82] However, as the international response to the Venezuelan displacement crisis remains acutely underfunded and Colombia faces its own economic challenges, the situation has begun to stress the country’s public services—including the healthcare system. The coronavirus pandemic is likely to exacerbate these challenges.\n\nThe impact of the pandemic on displaced Venezuelans living in Colombia is likely to be severe. First, despite the fact that Venezuelans have the right to free emergency healthcare in Colombia regardless of their immigration status, many cannot access that care because facilities lack capacity or because health workers are unaware of Venezuelans’ rights or even discriminate against them. Those who have regular status and are able to obtain insurance may have an easier time accessing care, and a broader range of care. Nevertheless, the majority of Venezuelans in Colombia have been unable to regularize their status. The number of Venezuelans with irregular status is only expected to increase as a result of the border closing. As indicated above, Venezuelans desperate for aid may instead resort to using informal channels to enter Colombia.[83]\n\nMany Venezuelans—including the pendulares who still live in Venezuela and cross frequently into Colombia to purchase goods or attend school—rely heavily on aid provided by international organizations and NGOs near the border. However, as part of the measures to close the border, the Colombian government ordered NGOs in the area to cut their capacity by half.[84] Moreover, on March 16, the Colombian Department of Health announced that gatherings of more than 50 people would be prohibited.[85] The restriction will inevitably impact organizations’ ability to operate in centers where Venezuelans shelter or gather to seek aid.\n\nTwo young Venezuelans with face marks cross the Rumichaca Bridge on the border between Colombia and Ecuador.

According to the latest official figures, Peru is host to the second largest number of Venezuelans (861,000 as of February 7, 2020).[86] As of December 31, 2019, Ecuador is host to 366,596 Venezuelans.\n\nOn March 15, Ecuador—where 1,823 cases and 48 deaths have now been reported—closed its borders to all foreign travelers.[87] Gatherings of more than 30 people were also banned.[88] In Peru, where 671 cases have been confirmed,[89] Peruvian President Martín Vizcarra also declared a state of emergency on March 15 and initially shut the country’s borders for 15 days.[90] Four days later, the government imposed a nationwide curfew and ban on private vehicles.[91]On March 25, President Vizcarra extended a state of emergency and nationwide quarantine through April 12.[92]\n\nThese border closures affect Venezuelans on the move from Colombia to Ecuador, Peru, and other third countries. For Venezuelans already inside these host countries, limited access to healthcare, loss of their livelihoods, and limits on movement and available services will put them at higher risk of infection or complications.\n\nOn March 18, Brazil ordered a partial closing of its border with Venezuela for 15 days.[93] President Bolsonaro has been criticized for his lax response to the pandemic, raising fears that the toll inside the country will be high.[94]Already, by March 25, there were 2,271 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 47 deaths. The latest official figures indicate that Brazil was host to more than 250,000 Venezuelans as of November 30, 2019, though the current number is likely much higher. Despite the government’s attempts to relocate Venezuelans who have crossed into the country, the majority remain concentrated in remote, impoverished areas along the northern border, where resources and infrastructure are sparse.[95] The inevitable damage from the coronavirus is thus likely to affect Venezuelans inside the country even as the border closing hinders others from accessing the critical healthcare they lack in Venezuela.\n\nEurope\n\nEurope has been hard hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. At the end of 2018, there were nearly 2.5 million refugees and 646,060 asylum seekers in the European Union (EU) alone.[96] As of March 17, just 10 cases had been reported among refugees and asylum seekers, all of them in Germany. Already, however, countries had begun to close their borders to asylum seekers. By March 16, Greece, Hungary, Belgium, and the Netherlands had shut their asylum offices.[97] In other countries, including Italy, asylum services have significantly slowed. Due to health and travel restrictions imposed to contain the spread of the coronavirus, NGOs have had to suspend search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean Sea for those attempting to cross from war-torn Libya.[98] Meanwhile, nationalist leaders and politicians—from Italy to Spain—have seized upon the outbreak as a false basis for xenophobic, anti-refugee rhetoric and policies.[99]\n\nItaly\n\nAs of March 29, 2020, there were 92,472 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy and 10,023 deaths—more deaths than in any other country. More than ten days after ordering a strict, nationwide lockdown, with the number of deaths surging, the Italian government called in the military on March 20 to enforce its approach.[100] On March 22, the Prime Minister ordered all non-essential businesses and factories to close and prohibited all non-essential movement within the country.[101] Even as the number of new cases in Italy began to slow, the government was expected to extend containment measures beyond the initial April 3 deadline.[102]\n\nThe impact on refugees and asylum seekers has been significant.[103] At the end of 2018, there were nearly 300,000 refugees and asylum seekers in Italy. Heeding lockdown and “social distancing” orders is difficult for these individuals, who often work in informal jobs, live in close quarters, and rely on government and NGO assistance. On March 12, the government suspended interviews for refugee status determination (RSD) and hearings for appeals of rejected asylum requests given court closures. By law, foreigners in Italy have access to healthcare. In practice, many asylum seekers fear going to hospitals if undocumented, or face discrimination or language barriers. All this will make it harder to detect the virus in a highly vulnerable population.\n\nGreece\n\nAs of March 29, Greece confirmed 1,156 coronavirus cases and 38 deaths.[104] While this is less than several other European countries, the Greek government is concerned that if it does not act quickly, it could follow the trajectory of Italy. Greece has therefore enacted a country-wide lockdown, closing hotels and suspending most international flights.[105] The Ministry of Migration and Asylum has suspended all administrative services until April 13 at the earliest. This includes registering asylum seekers, conducting interviews, adjudicating cases, and reviewing appeals.\n\nThe shutdown of the entire Greek asylum system leaves all asylum seekers in a precarious position. Arguably, no population in Greece is more vulnerable to the coronavirus than the more than 40,000 asylum seekers trapped on the Aegean Islands.[106] Conditions are appalling in the Reception and Identification Centers (RICs) where asylum seekers are required to live. The official RICs and their overflow areas are squalid and overcrowded, hosting approximately eight times their capacity. These areas lack basic hygiene facilities, have very few latrines, and provide minimal medical care at best. There is no running water, making frequent hand washing impractical.\n\nMigrants living in the Moria camp sew handmade protective face masks on the Greek island of Lesbos, as the country is under lockdown to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus.

Instead, the government instituted a curfew and prohibited NGOs from entering the camps for at least 14 days.[107] These measures reduce essential services in the camps, including food distributions, childcare, and servicing latrines. Relief groups have been calling on the Greek government to evacuate camp residents to facilities across the country in order to save the lives of asylum seekers and Greek citizens alike.[108] The EU has now echoed this call to evacuate the most vulnerable asylum seekers in the camps to other areas on the islands,[109] a crucial first step to protect asylum seekers and limit the likely spread in the camps.\n\nThe Middle East\n\nThe Middle East is fast becoming an epicenter of the coronavirus crisis. Cases have escalated dramatically in Lebanon and Iran. New infections have emerged in more than half a dozen other countries in the region including Iraq and Afghanistan. At least 12 million refugees and IDPs live in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Turkey. Borders throughout the Middle East are porous, with refugees, economic migrants, and others often traveling along informal routes. Another challenge to an effective coronavirus response is the region’s weak or broken public health systems.\n\nHowever, the situation also differs significantly between countries. Turkey, with over 3.4 million Syrian refugees, has a robust healthcare system and the government is somewhat better positioned to respond to an outbreak and employ basic containment tools like contact tracing. On the other hand, Iraq and Lebanon have severely weak public health systems and are not able to adequately monitor what is going on and provide a robust public health response.\n\nThe Syria Crisis\n\nSyria’s brutal war entered its tenth year last month. More than 5.6 million have fled Syria since 2011, and over 6.5 million remain displaced inside the country.[110] The majority of Syrian refugees in neighboring countries and internally displaced Syrians lack the most basic needs, including access to healthcare. Even the most basic guidance on social distancing and personal hygiene will be difficult to follow where refugees and IDPs often live in overcrowded and unhygienic camps and informal settlements.\n\nThe situation in the northwest of Syria is of particular concern. It will be extremely challenging to launch an effective response to a coronavirus outbreak in places like Idlib province. While no confirmed cases of Coronavirus have been announced in Idlib, this appears to be largely due to the lack of testing kits. At least three people who showed symptoms of COVID-19 died in the past week, and there are several other patients with the virus symptoms who are quarantined inside hospitals, a doctor and a representative of a medical organization in Idlib told Refugees International. More than 1 million people are staying in overcrowded and unhygienic camps where it is very challenging to impose social distancing.[111] Very few people are staying home. The economic situation is such that if people do not work, they do not have the means to feed their families. Moreover, there is no authority inside Idlib that has the means to enforce preventive measures, and the various fighting factions on the ground appear to have other priorities.\n\nSyrians are seen on the mud covered road between tents at a refugee camp after heavy rain in Idlib, Syria.

The facilities that remain will have little of the equipment required to treat coronavirus patients, such as ventilators, or to protect healthcare workers from infection as they go about their duties. On March 25, WHO delivered 300 testing kits to the northwest.[112] The main challenge is that the whole area has only around 100 ventilators. Efforts to screen populations with infrared non-contact thermometers are also necessary. Any type of support for the general capacity of what remains of the medical system in northwest Syria could make a significant difference.\n\nOutside of Syria, more needs to be done now to help prepare the camps and communities that host Syrian refugees in neighboring countries. Countries like Lebanon, host to more than 1 million Syrian refugees, are already experiencing significant outbreaks that are taxing their national healthcare systems. Jordan hosts the second largest Syrian refugee population per capita in the world. Because these refugees are unlikely to be a top priority for the national authorities, the international humanitarian community must step in to fill the gaps, in collaboration with host governments.\n\nIraq\n\nDecades of conflict and widespread violence have wreaked havoc on the lives of millions of civilians in Iraq. According to UNHCR, more than 6.5 million people—approximately 18 percent of the population—are currently in need of humanitarian assistance, including 3 million children.[113] Nearly 2 million people remain displaced inside the country, the majority of whom have taken refuge in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI). Moreover, Iraq is host to around 300,000, mostly Syrian, refugees.[114] Many live inside camps where poor conditions and outdated infrastructure could exacerbate the spread of the coronavirus.[115]\n\nAs of March 29, 547 cases of confirmed coronavirus had been reported in Iraq.[116] However, the real number was likely much higher. The country’s health system, undermined by decades of sanctions, neglect, corruption and violence, suffers from significant gaps including shortages of supplies, equipment, and staff.[117] To prevent further spread of the virus, the Baghdad and KRI governments imposed a curfew and cancelled all domestic flights. However, security forces are struggling to enforce the lockdown as thousands of pilgrims from across the country visit shrines in the capital.[118] In addition, humanitarian actors have reported that curfews and movement restrictions are impacting the delivery of assistance to people in need.[119]\n\nHumanitarian groups in Iraq have developed a COVID-19 preparedness and response planning in the camps. Moreover, UN agencies are supporting Iraq with testing capacities and the procurement of personal protective equipment for health partners. Donors and humanitarian organizations should increase their efforts to support Iraq and the KRI government’s response. They should offer personnel support to fill staff shortages and provide the necessary supplies and equipment.\n\nYemen\n\nThe WHO announced that, so far, there are no confirmed cases of coronavirus in Yemen.[120] However, a virus outbreak will almost certainly have a devastating effect. Yemen hosts what may be the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, with more than 24 million people in need of assistance, and nearly 3.65 million internally displaced.[121] A relentless war has decimated the country’s healthcare system. In the past few years, Yemen has witnessed the worst cholera epidemic in recent history.[122]\n\nLast week, both the Houthi rebels and Yemen’s internationally recognized government banned international flights in an attempt to keep the country free of the coronavirus.[123] The ban includes chartered medical evacuations. Despite the halt to passenger flights, the UN-led Yemen aid operation continues for the moment, with the vast majority of staff being Yemeni. The UN confirmed that seaports remain open for cargo. Yemen is largely reliant on cargo arriving by sea for imports of food, fuel, and other consumer essentials critical to civilian welfare.\n\nThe WHO is supporting the national health authorities to prepare for the coronavirus with medical supplies, testing kits, training, and information campaigns. However, some international relief teams have scaled back to essential staff only. A fingerprint-driven digital registration system for aid recipients to limit aid fraud has been paused.[124] Top priority, life-saving assistance such as food, water, sanitation, and health services will continue, but some less critical aid programs will be slowed. The international humanitarian community must step in to help Yemen’s medical personnel to prepare for a virus outbreak. It should particularly provide medical facilities with testing kits, medical equipment, and supplies in addition to personnel protective gear to help protect healthcare workers.\n\nRecommendations\n\nThe challenge of containing and mitigating the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic across the world’s most vulnerable, displaced populations is breathtaking in scope. Each humanitarian crisis will require a strategy tailored to the specific needs and circumstances of the displaced population in question – a strategy that is workable in a context that will undoubtedly include significant resource constraints. That said, there are common elements across the countries and continents reviewed above, which lend themselves to key principles and recommendations that should be part of any effective humanitarian response to the pandemic.\n\nThe response must be inclusive: The response to COVID-19 must be inclusive if it is to be effective. International assistance to address the pandemic must reach all vulnerable populations, including the refugees, asylum seekers, and the internally displaced. Governments receiving U.S. assistance for COVID-19 should ensure that the forcibly displaced living in both camp and non-camp settings are included in prevention and mitigation efforts. By the same token, aid for refugees and internally displaced people to address the COVID-19 pandemic should be made available to host communities in refugee-hosting areas. In short, the aim should be to improve systems for all persons regardless of nationality.\n\nEnhance communications and the flow of information: Governments and international aid groups should develop information campaigns to ensure displaced communities have accurate and current information about the coronavirus and response efforts. Where possible, they should work with local civil society and displaced persons themselves to ensure language and means of communications are easily accessible and widely disseminated. Governments should lift any phone and internet restrictions in and around displaced communities.\n\nDeploy medical personnel, supplies, and personal protective equipment: Donors and international aid groups should prioritize the deployment of qualified medical personnel to refugee, asylum seeker, and IDP-dense areas, along with personal protective equipment and other medical supplies such as gloves and masks for humanitarian health workers to ensure their safety in addressing COVID-19 outbreaks in displacement camps. Appropriate training for existing health care personnel must occur, particularly for treatment of severe cases with limited ICU access.\n\nPrioritize hygiene and other WASH-related interventions: Donors and international aid groups should improve access to water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) facilities for refugee and internally displaced populations – especially those living in camps or camp-like settings. This should include the distribution of essential personal hygiene items including soap and disposable towels. The response should also recognize best practices for response for particularly vulnerable populations, such as women and girls.\n\nFocus on decongestion and isolation and quarantine capacities: Donors, host governments, and international aid groups should prioritize decongestion and building isolation and quarantine capacities in camps and camp-like settings. Services like food distribution and education should be restructured to avoid large gatherings. Donors and others should take steps now to support establishment of capabilities within displaced communities for implementation of isolation and quarantine procedures in accordance with best medical and public health advice and practices. Given the extremely high density of certain settings, novel strategies for “shielding” may need to be carefully attempted.\n\nBuild up testing and surveillance capabilities: Donors and international aid groups should prioritize deployment of rapid testing capability in adequate quantity to refugee and IDP settings. With respect to surveillance, the good news is that many formal camps already have epidemiological surveillance systems already in place. These need to be strengthened and adapted to screen for COVID-19, especially for all new arrivals in the camps.\n\nStop detentions and deportations of asylum seekers: Public health officials universally agree that detention in crowded facilities increases the risk of transmission for asylum seekers and immigrants in custody, along with immigration and border officials. Governments should put in place alternatives to detention polices and ensure that all migrants have access to testing and healthcare regardless of status. Deportation of any individuals without prior medical testing risks exporting the virus into countries unprepared to deal with mass outbreaks because of pre-existing crises and substantial vulnerable and marginalized populations with little access to limited healthcare systems.\n\nProtect those who fear persecution from forced return: Any restrictions that governments impose on travel should include provisions that safeguard individuals from forced return to torture or persecution. Moreover, extraordinary policy measures that impose unusual burdens for those seeking asylum should be lifted as soon as circumstances permit. In times of national emergency, protecting vulnerable people from gross abuses of their basic rights can become far more challenging for governments, but it is at those very times when our commitment to such rights is decisively measured.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nRefugees International would like to thank the following people for their contributions to this report:\n\nTony Banbury , President and CEO of the International Foundation for Electoral Systems\n\n, President and CEO of the International Foundation for Electoral Systems Chris Beyrer , Desmond M.

An uncontrolled collapse of Credit Suisse would lead to incalculable consequences for the country and the international financial system.\"\n\nCredit Suisse is designated by the Financial Stability Board, an international body that monitors the global financial system, as one of the world’s globally systemic important banks. This means regulators believe its uncontrolled failure would lead to ripples throughout the financial system not unlike the collapse of Lehman Brothers 15 years ago.\n\nMarkets remain jittery despite the best efforts of regulators to restore calm. Shares fell Monday in Asia, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng index down 2.7% and Tokyo's benchmark Nikkei 225 losing 1.2%. Bank shares in the region were lower and futures in London and Frankfurt also fell.\n\nSunday's news conference follows the collapse of two large US banks last week that spurred a frantic, broad response from the US government to prevent any further bank panics. Still, global financial markets have been on edge since Credit Suisse's share price began plummeting this week.\n\nThe 167-year-old Credit Suisse already received a $50 billion (54 million Swiss francs) loan from the Swiss National Bank, which briefly caused a rally in the bank's stock price. Yet the move did not appear to be enough to stem an outflow of deposits, according to news reports.\n\nStill, many of Credit Suisse's problems are unique and do not overlap with the weaknesses that brought down Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, whose failures led to a significant rescue effort by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Reserve. As a result, their downfall does not necessarily signal the start of a financial crisis similar to what occurred in 2008.\n\nThe deal caps a highly volatile week for Credit Suisse, most notably on Wednesday when its shares plunged to a record low after its largest investor, the Saudi National Bank, said it wouldn't invest any more money into the bank to avoid tripping regulations that would kick in if its stake rose about 10%.\n\nFollowing news of the Swiss deal, the world’s central banks announced coordinated moves to stabilize banks, including access to a lending facility for banks to borrow U.S. dollars if they need them, a practice widely used during the 2008 crisis. Three months after Lehman Brothers collapsed in September of 2008, such swap lines had been tapped for $580 billion. Swap lines also were rolled out during market turmoil in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nColm Kelleher, the UBS chairman, hailed \"enormous opportunities\" from the takeover and highlighted his bank’s \"conservative risk culture\" – a subtle swipe at Credit Suisse's reputation for more swashbuckling gambles in search of bigger returns. He said the combined group would create a wealth manager with over $5 trillion in total invested assets.\n\nOn Friday, shares dropped 8% to close at 1.86 francs ($2) on the Swiss exchange. The stock has seen a long downward slide: It traded at more than 80 francs in 2007.\n\nIts current troubles began after Credit Suisse reported on Tuesday that managers had identified \"material weaknesses\" in the bank’s internal controls on financial reporting as of the end of last year. That fanned fears that Credit Suisse would be the next domino to fall.\n\nWhile smaller than its Swiss rival UBS, Credit Suisse still wields considerable influence, with $1.4 trillion assets under management. The firm has significant trading desks around the world, caters to the rich and wealthy through its wealth management business, and is a major advisor for global companies in mergers and acquisitions. Notably, Credit Suisse did not need government assistance in 2008 during the financial crisis, while UBS did.\n\nDespite the banking turmoil, the European Central Bank on Thursday approved a large, half-percentage point increase in interest rates to try to curb stubbornly high inflation, saying Europe’s banking sector is \"resilient,\" with strong finances.\n\nECB President Christine Lagarde said the banks \"are in a completely different position from 2008\" during the financial crisis, partly because of stricter government regulation.\n\nThe Swiss bank has been pushing to raise money from investors and roll out a new strategy to overcome an array of troubles, including bad bets on hedge funds, repeated shake-ups of its top management and a spying scandal involving UBS.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nThe Swiss government ordered Credit Suisse to temporarily suspend bonus payments to staff.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA. Credit Suisse announced material weaknesses in its financial reporting.\nB. Credit Suisse shareholders will receive one UBS share for every 22.48 Credit Suisse shares.\nC. None of the others are correct causes.\nD.

Bank shares in the region were lower and futures in London and Frankfurt also fell.\n\nSunday's news conference follows the collapse of two large US banks last week that spurred a frantic, broad response from the US government to prevent any further bank panics. Still, global financial markets have been on edge since Credit Suisse's share price began plummeting this week.\n\nThe 167-year-old Credit Suisse already received a $50 billion (54 million Swiss francs) loan from the Swiss National Bank, which briefly caused a rally in the bank's stock price. Yet the move did not appear to be enough to stem an outflow of deposits, according to news reports.\n\nStill, many of Credit Suisse's problems are unique and do not overlap with the weaknesses that brought down Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, whose failures led to a significant rescue effort by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Reserve. As a result, their downfall does not necessarily signal the start of a financial crisis similar to what occurred in 2008.\n\nThe deal caps a highly volatile week for Credit Suisse, most notably on Wednesday when its shares plunged to a record low after its largest investor, the Saudi National Bank, said it wouldn't invest any more money into the bank to avoid tripping regulations that would kick in if its stake rose about 10%.\n\nFollowing news of the Swiss deal, the world’s central banks announced coordinated moves to stabilize banks, including access to a lending facility for banks to borrow U.S. dollars if they need them, a practice widely used during the 2008 crisis. Three months after Lehman Brothers collapsed in September of 2008, such swap lines had been tapped for $580 billion. Swap lines also were rolled out during market turmoil in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nColm Kelleher, the UBS chairman, hailed \"enormous opportunities\" from the takeover and highlighted his bank’s \"conservative risk culture\" – a subtle swipe at Credit Suisse's reputation for more swashbuckling gambles in search of bigger returns. He said the combined group would create a wealth manager with over $5 trillion in total invested assets.\n\nOn Friday, shares dropped 8% to close at 1.86 francs ($2) on the Swiss exchange. The stock has seen a long downward slide: It traded at more than 80 francs in 2007.\n\nIts current troubles began after Credit Suisse reported on Tuesday that managers had identified \"material weaknesses\" in the bank’s internal controls on financial reporting as of the end of last year. That fanned fears that Credit Suisse would be the next domino to fall.\n\nWhile smaller than its Swiss rival UBS, Credit Suisse still wields considerable influence, with $1.4 trillion assets under management. The firm has significant trading desks around the world, caters to the rich and wealthy through its wealth management business, and is a major advisor for global companies in mergers and acquisitions. Notably, Credit Suisse did not need government assistance in 2008 during the financial crisis, while UBS did.\n\nDespite the banking turmoil, the European Central Bank on Thursday approved a large, half-percentage point increase in interest rates to try to curb stubbornly high inflation, saying Europe’s banking sector is \"resilient,\" with strong finances.\n\nECB President Christine Lagarde said the banks \"are in a completely different position from 2008\" during the financial crisis, partly because of stricter government regulation.\n\nThe Swiss bank has been pushing to raise money from investors and roll out a new strategy to overcome an array of troubles, including bad bets on hedge funds, repeated shake-ups of its top management and a spying scandal involving UBS.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nThe Swiss government ordered Credit Suisse to temporarily suspend bonus payments to staff.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert at causal reasoning."}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n### CONTEXT\n[Doc 1]\nTitle: August 22, 2021\nContent: A week after the Taliban took control of Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, as the U.S. was withdrawing the forces that have been in the country since 2001, the initial chaos created by the Taliban’s rapid sweep across the country has simmered down into what is at least a temporary pattern.\n\nWe knew there was a good chance that the Taliban would regain control of the country when we left, although that was not a foregone conclusion. The former president, Donald Trump, recognized that the American people were tired of the ongoing war in Afghanistan, which was approaching its 20th year, and in February 2020, his administration negotiated with the Taliban to enable the U.S. to withdraw. In exchange for the release of 5000 Taliban fighters and the promise that the U.S. would withdraw within the next 14 months, the Taliban agreed not to attack U.S. soldiers.\n\nTrump’s dislike of the war in Afghanistan reflected the unpopularity of the long engagement, which by 2020 was ill defined. The war had begun in 2001, after terrorists affiliated with al-Qaeda attacked the United States on September 11 of that year. Taliban leaders in control of Afghanistan sheltered al-Qaeda, and after the attacks, the U.S. president, George W. Bush, demanded that Afghanistan hand over the terrorist leader believed to be behind the terrorist attack on the U.S: Osama bin Laden. In October, after Taliban leaders refused, the U.S. launched a bombing campaign.\n\nThat campaign was successful enough that in December 2001 the Taliban offered to surrender. But the U.S. rejected that surrender, determined by then to eradicate the extremist group and fill the vacuum of its collapse with a new, pro-American government. Al-Qaeda leader bin Laden escaped from Afghanistan to Pakistan, and the U.S. project in Afghanistan turned from an anti-terrorism mission into an effort to rebuild the Afghan government into a modern democracy.\n\nBy 2002 the Bush administration was articulating a new doctrine in foreign policy, arguing that the U.S. had a right to strike preemptively against countries that harbor terrorists. In 2003, under this doctrine, the U.S. launched a war on Iraq, which diverted money, troops, and attention from Afghanistan. The Taliban regrouped and began to regain the territory it had lost after the U.S. first began its bombing campaign in 2001.\n\nBy 2005, Bush administration officials privately worried the war in Afghanistan could not be won on its current terms, especially with the U.S. focused on Iraq. Then, when he took office in 2009, President Barack Obama turned his attention back to Afghanistan. He threw more troops into that country, bringing their numbers close to 100,000. In 2011, the U.S. military located bin Laden in Abbottabad, Pakistan, and launched a raid on the compound where he was hiding, killing him. By 2014, Obama had drawn troops in Afghanistan down to about 11,000, and in December of that year, he announced that the mission of the war—weakening the Taliban and capturing bin Laden—had been accomplished, and thus the war was over. The troops would come home.\n\nBut, of course, they didn’t, leaving Trump to develop his own policy. But his administration’s approach to the chaos in that country was different than his predecessor’s. By negotiating with the Taliban and excluding the Afghan government the U.S. had been supporting, the Trump team essentially accepted that the Taliban were the most important party in Afghanistan. The agreement itself reflected the oddity of the negotiations. Each clause referring to the Taliban began: “The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan which is not recognized by the United States as a state and is known as the Taliban will….”\n\nIt was immediately clear that the Taliban was not living up to its side of the bargain. Although it did stop attacking U.S. troops, It began to escalate violence in Afghanistan itself, assassinated political opponents, and maintained ties to al-Qaeda. Nonetheless, the Trump administration put pressure on the leaders of the Afghan government to release the 5000 Taliban prisoners, and they eventually did. Before Biden took office, Trump dropped the U.S. troop engagement in Afghanistan from about 13,000 to about 2500.\n\nWhen he took office, Biden had to decide whether to follow Trump’s path or to push back on the Taliban on the grounds they were not honoring the agreement Trump’s people had hammered out. Biden himself wanted to get out of the war. At the same time, he recognized that fighting the Taliban again would mean throwing more troops back into Afghanistan, and that the U.S. would again begin to take casualties. He opted to get the troops out, but extended the deadline to September 11, 2021, the twentieth anniversary of the initial attack. (Former president Trump complained that the troops should come out faster.)\n\nWhat Biden did not foresee was the speed with which the Taliban would retake control of the country. It swept over the regional capitals and then Kabul in about nine days in mid-August with barely a shot fired, and the head of the Afghan government fled the country, leaving it in chaos.\n\nThat speed left the U.S. flatfooted. Afghans who had been part of the government or who had helped the U.S. and its allies rushed to the airport to try to escape. In the pandemonium of that first day, up to seven people were killed; two people appear to have clung to a U.S. military plane as it took off, falling to their deaths.\n\nAnd yet, the Taliban, so far, has promised amnesty for its former opponents and limited rights for women. It has its own problems, as the Afghan government has been supported for the previous 20 years by foreign money, including a large percentage from the U.S. Not only has that money dried up as foreign countries refuse to back the Taliban, but also Biden has put sanctions on Afghanistan and also on some Pakistanis suspected of funding the Taliban. At the same time it appears that no other major sponsor, like Russia or China, has stepped in to fill the vacuum left by U.S. money, leaving the Taliban fishing for whatever goodwill it can find.\n\nYesterday, Josh Marshall of Talking Points Memo flagged tweets showing that members of the Afghan government, including the brother of the president who fled, are in what appear from the photos posted on Twitter to be relaxed talks about forming a new government. Other factions in Afghanistan would like to stop this from happening, and today Biden’s national security adviser Jake Sullivan warned that ISIS-K, another extremist group, is threatening to attack the airport to destabilize the Taliban.\n\nMeanwhile, there are 10,000 people crowded into that airport, and U.S. evacuations continue. The Kabul airport is secure—for now—and the U.S. military has created a larger perimeter around it for protection. The U.S. government has asked Americans in Afghanistan to shelter in place until they can be moved out safely; the Qatari ambassador to Afghanistan has been escorting groups of them to the airport. Evacuations have been slower than hoped because of backlogs at the next stage of the journey, but the government has enlisted the help of 18 commercial airlines to move those passengers forward, leaving room for new evacuees.\n\nYesterday, about 7800 evacuees left the Kabul airport. About 28,000 have been evacuated since August 14.\n\nInterestingly, much of the U.S. media is describing this scenario as a disaster for President Biden. Yet, on CNN this morning, Matthew Dowd, who was the chief strategist for the Bush-Cheney ticket in 2004, noted that more than 20,000 people have been evacuated from Afghanistan without a single loss of an American life, while in the same period of time, 5000 Americans have died from Covid-19 and 500 have died from gunshots.\n\n—-\n\nNotes:\n\nhttps://www.npr.org/2020/02/29/810537586/u-s-signs-peace-deal-with-taliban-after-nearly-2-decades-of-war-in-afghanistan\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2021/08/12/obama-afghan-war-ending-afghanistan-papers-book-excerpt/\n\nhttps://www.factcheck.org/2021/08/timeline-of-u-s-withdrawal-from-afghanistan/\n\nhttps://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/you-wouldnt-know-it-from-the-us-news-coverage-but\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/16/kabul-airport-chaos-and-panic-as-afghans-and-foreigners-attempt-to-flee-the-capital\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2021/08/22/afghanistan-biden-evacuations/\n\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2021/08/21/politics/kabul-airport-terror-warning/index.html\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/08/17/treasury-taliban-money-afghanistan/\n\nShare\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nTaliban militants captured several provincial capitals, including Zaranj, Sheberghan, Kunduz, Sar-e Pol, Taloqan, and Aybak, between August 6 and August 9.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Satellite data from Brazil's National Institute of Space Research shows that there have been more than 74,000 fires this year, many of them in the Amazon. The demonstrations are \"in defense of the Amazon and our future,\" according to organizers.\n\nOver the past few days, international pressure has been steadily growing on Bolsonaro over his handling of the issue, especially from European leaders. A spokesman for Britain's newly installed prime minister, Boris Johnson, said he was \"deeply concerned\" about the fires and \"the impact of the tragic loss of these precious habitats.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron plans to highlight the Amazon crisis at this weekend's G-7 summit in Biarritz, France, after sending out a tweet describing them as \"an international crisis\" and declaring: \"Our house is burning. Literally. The Amazon rain forest — the lungs which produces 20% of the planet's oxygen — is on fire.\"\n\nMacron raised the pressure on Brazil on Friday, issuing a statement accusing Bolsonaro of lying to him about his position on climate change and announcing that France has withdrawn its support for the Mercosur trade deal between the European Union and a South American bloc that includes Brazil. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar warned that Ireland would pull out of the Mercosur agreement if Brazil did not take action to protect the rainforest, according to Reuters.\n\nBolsonaro has made clear that he considers the Amazon rainforest — 60% of which is in Brazil — to be an issue of national sovereignty, and he makes no secret of his resentment at what he deems to be foreign interference driven by a desire to hold back Brazilian agrobusiness from competing in international markets.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption AP AP\n\nIn recent weeks, he has alienated Germany and Norway, the two main contributors to the Amazon Fund, which supports forest preservation initiatives, prompting them to withhold tens of millions of dollars.\n\nHis approach has won applause from his supporters on the far right, but is also causing widespread fears among Brazilians that it is proving highly damaging to the country's international standing and may prompt a backlash that could impact exports.\n\n\"The image of the burning forest ignites public opinion and incinerates Brazil's reputation,\" wrote Ana Lucia Azevedo, a columnist for O Globo. She warns that the crisis is wrecking \"the prestige and credibility\" acquired by Brazil after 2005, when deforestation rates dipped sharply.\n\nAnother commentator, Vinicius Torrer Freire, wrote: \"Within a few months, especially in recent weeks, he has knocked down two decades of improvements in Brazil's international image regarding the environment.\"\n\nBolsonaro argues that it is possible simultaneously to develop the Amazon and preserve the forest. His critics point to his record of relentlessly undermining institutions responsible for preserving and monitoring the Amazon.\n\nSince taking office in January, he has severely weakened government environmental enforcement organizations, by cutting budgets and laying off staff. When Brazil's National Institute of Space Research released satellite data showing a sharp month-on-month rise in deforestation over last year, Bolsonaro dismissed this as \"lies\" and replaced the director with a military official.\n\nLatin America Brazil's Amazon Rainforest Is Disappearing Under President Jair Bolsonaro Brazil's Amazon Rainforest Is Disappearing Under President Jair Bolsonaro Listen · 7:57 7:57\n\nHis approach is causing deep concern among professionals fighting to protect the forest, who argue that these moves send the wrong message to illegal deforesters.\n\n\"They feel emboldened to carry out more deforestation,\" said Fluvio Mascarenhas, who works for the Chico Mendes Institute for the Conversation of Biodiversity — a government monitoring agency — in the western state of Acre.\n\nIn a recent interview with NPR, Mascarenhas expressed profound concern about the impact of Bolsonaro's policies.\n\n\"Every time you look at a satellite image of the forest, you see another little piece is missing,\" he said.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nPresident Bolsonaro announced a 60-day ban on setting fires for land clearing and deployed 44,000 soldiers to seven states.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Doctors fought to save Mr Abe’s life, but despite a few moments of consciousness after the shooting, the former PM was described as being continuously comatose during desperate efforts of medical resuscitation. Responding to this apparent act of political violence, PM Fumio Kishida condemned the attack, saying: “It is barbaric…and it cannot be tolerated.” The Fire and Disaster Management Agency had earlier confirmed that Mr Abe had a bullet wound on the right of his neck, and also suffered subcutaneous bleeding under the left part of his chest. Mr Abe was said to be responsive in the minutes after the attack, but the 67-year-old’s situation later deteriorated. Eyewitnesses saw a man firing twice at Mr Abe from behind. Security officers detained the attacker, who made no attempt to run, and seized his weapon – reportedly a handmade gun.\n\nThe suspect has been identified as Nara resident Tetsuya Yamagami. Local media reports say he is believed to be a former member of Japan’s Maritime Self-Defense Forces, and that it was an improvised firearm. Explosives have subsequently been found at the suspect’s home. On Japanese social media, the hashtag, “We want democracy, not violence” was trending, with many social media users expressing their disgust towards the incident.\n\nPolitically hawkish, Shinzo Abe favoured revision of Japan’s pacifist constitution, and honoured the Yasukuni Shrine, itself controversial primarily because its Book of Souls contains the names of more than a thousand war criminals from WW2. Naturally, world leaders are stunned by Shinzo Abe’s murder. Japan’s own Foreign Ministry and several prominent politicians in Japan and abroad warned of ‘attacks on supporters of democracy everywhere’. British PM Boris Johnston described his murder as “despicable”, while French President, Emmanuel Macron said it was “an atrocity”. Antony Blinken, US secretary of state, described the shooting as a “very, very sad moment”,” speaking from the G20 in Bali, Indonesia. Former US president Donald Trump called it “a tremendous blow to the wonderful people of Japan”. Japan’s fellow Quad members, Australia, India and the US, were among the first to respond after the shooting. China’s foreign ministry also expressed “shock” at Abe’s shooting and extended condolences to his family. Kevin Rudd, the former Australian PM, called it, “a sober reminder to all our democracies of how precious our freedoms are…. an attack on supporters of democracy everywhere.”\n\nIndia’s PM Narendra Modi said he was, “deeply distressed”. Tsai Ing-wen, Taiwan president, condemned the “violent and illegal acts”. Abe’s public support for Taiwan had strengthened since he left office in the face of rising Chinese aggression against the democratic nation. Charles Michel, European Council president, said he was “shocked and saddened by the cowardly attack on Shinzo Abe… [The] EU stands with the people of Japan and [prime minister Fumio] Kishida in these difficult times.” Abe had previously outraged Chinese nationalists. A Weibo comment about the incident immediately went viral across the PRC: “Don’t forget that he visited the Yasukuni Shrine,” referring (above) to the controversial memorial that honours Japan’s war dead. Leif-Eric Easley said the shooting was a “major shock for Japanese politics and society…But Japan’s foreign policy will probably remain consistent, focused on strengthening the rules-based order with the USA and other international partners.” Anthony Albanese, Australia’s prime minister, observed, “our thoughts are with his family and the people of Japan at this time”.\n\nIn Japan, possession of firearms is restricted, and while political violence is not unheard of, Abe’s shooting revisits the memories of Japan’s Pre-World War II era. For example, PM Hirobumi Ito was killed in 1909—after he had left office—at a train station in Japanese-occupied northeast China. Indeed, Tokyo Station still bears an inscription near the site where another PM, Takashi Hara was fatally stabbed on Nov. 4, 1921. Japan’s political violence intensified during the 1930s as ultra-rightists sought to destroy the multiparty constitutional government. For example, an attempted coup on February 26, 1936, assassinated finance minister, Korekiyo Takahashi, and others, wounded the PM, and almost overwhelmed legitimate democratic government. The coup was quashed, but at the expense of growing military influence over the government.\n\nPost WW2, as Japan metamorphosed into a democracy, political violence lessened, but even so there were still outbreaks of riots and assassinations. In 1960 Otoya Yamaguchi stabbed to death Mr Inejiro Asanuma, leader of the Japanese Opposition Socialist movement. In 2007, Nagasaki’s Mayor, Iccho Ito, a fervent opponent of nuclear weapons, was shot dead by a right-wing group. Prior to this was the stabbing to death of Koki Ishii, an outspoken member of the opposition Democratic Party of Japan. These events show that Japan does to an extent possess a submerged history of political violence, uncannily in a country known for its post-WW2 pacifism and high level of public safety. Japanese citizens will surely question the fragility of their democracy as Abe will be laid to rest in public ceremonies.\n\nFurther Reading on E-International Relations\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nWorld leaders expressed shock and condemned the murder.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

He notes the U.S. government’s actions could be seen as a reciprocal move in this ongoing geopolitical rivalry.\n\n“From the standpoint of the U.S. threatening the same thing, that ‘If you aren’t abiding by our concerns, then we are going to impose these constraints’—that's not unique,” he says. “So, I think from that standpoint, there is precedent for it…. Will it help relations between the countries? Certainly not.”\n\nGeringer notes that the TikTok ban fits into a broader pattern of geopolitical competition and suggests that the ban could lead to diplomatic tensions with China and might prompt some form of retaliatory response.\n\n“Is it something that's going to cause World War III? I don't believe so,” he says, suggesting the target might be a corporation like “Apple, or limiting one of the other [U.S.] companies on what they can do if they're collecting information or operating in China.”\n\nGeringer concurred with Mourning’s assessment that whether TikTok becomes unavailable or merely less stable thanks to a ban, users will seek other platforms.\n\n“People are still going to demand social media. They're going to demand content. And [users] are going to go somewhere,” he says.\n\nAmid this week’s uncertainty around a Supreme Court decision, millions of TikTok users have started migrating to Rednote (Xiaohongshu), another Chinese-owned platform, raising further questions about whether a ban would truly mitigate risks. Geringer notes the impacts of a TikTok ban on U.S. market share might create a ripple effect on retaliation in other sectors, as well.\n\n“China is one of the top economies of the world. This [market share] is important whether it's going to be in social media or in other sectors. You know, smartphones, chips, computers, whatever—it's going to be about whether you're missing out on this very large market. That could be quite substantial.”\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nOn January 20, 2025, President Donald Trump sought to delay enforcement of the 2024 law banning TikTok distribution, intending to work out a divestment deal.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

In the next three years, Huawei, the world’s second largest smartphone vendor, will look to bring HarmonyOS to more devices, including smartphones, he said.\n\nYu said, without offering any proof, that HarmonyOS is “more powerful and secure than Android.” He said HarmonyOS’ IPC performance is five times that of Google’s Fuchsia. The top executive also claimed that HarmonyOS’ microkernel has “one-thousandth the amount of code in the Linux kernel.”\n\n“A modularized HarmonyOS can be nested to adapt flexibly to any device to create a seamless cross-device experience. Developed via the distributed capability kit, it builds the foundation of a shared developer ecosystem,” the company said in a statement, adding that it began to explore developing its own operating system “as early as 10 years ago.”\n\nThe company said it intends to continue to use Android moving forward, but HarmonyOS is officially its back-up plan if things go south. “We will prioritize Android for smartphones, but if we can’t use Android, we will be able to install HarmonyOS quickly,” Yu said.\n\nThe availability of the mobile operating system, which is open source, will be limited to China for now, though the company has plans to bring it to international markets at a later stage, he said.\n\nThe company said it has worked on security and trustworthiness aspects of the operating system from the ground up. It said HarmonyOS uses formal verification methods to “reshape security.” Formal verification methods are an effective mathematical approach to validate system correctness from the source, while traditional verification methods, such as functional verification and attack simulation, “are confined to limited scenarios,” the company claimed.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $475 on your TechCrunch All Stage pass Build smarter.

The U.S. government has accused Huawei of stealing trade secrets, and said it poses a risk to national security. Huawei has denied these accusations and pursued legal means to fight back.\n\nIn the aftermath, Google, Intel and other U.S.-based companies that contribute much of the technology and solutions that go into a smartphone suspended their business with Huawei, thereby severely questioning the company’s future prospects.\n\nThe ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China has already started to impact Huawei’s bottom line. The company’s performance in the quarter that ended in June was weak, compared to several previous quarters.\n\nWhat remains unclear is the kind of impact the U.S.’ accusations have had on the Chinese giant’s brand image worldwide. According to research firm Counterpoint, about half of all Huawei smartphones ship outside China.\n\nHuawei was poised to become the world’s biggest vendor by shipment — something it would have achieved — “if not for the trade war,” Yu said.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nHuawei announced a deployment timeline for HarmonyOS on various devices between 2020 and 2022.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert at causal reasoning."}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n### CONTEXT\n[Doc 1]\nTitle: The Texas Power Grid and the Failure of Deregulation\nContent: By now, the early message that the electricity blackout in Texas was a failure of renewable energy has been replaced by the far more complex reality of a grid not prepared for extreme weather. Texas takes pride in its free market–fueled economic environment that provides low-cost housing, cheap electricity, and plenty of personal transportation along with low taxes. The problem is that the absence of rules and governance can come back and create harm if you happen to live on a more crowded and complex planet, like the one we have here on Earth. Climate change, pandemics, traffic jams, toxic air, polluted water and poisoned land cannot be addressed by the free market alone. The market can be used to produce needed goods and services, but the idea that markets and civilization itself can survive without rules is absurd idiocy.\n\nTexas this past week was a case in point. The electric grid in Texas is built for efficiency, but it is not built for climate resilience. As Katherine Blunt and Russell Gold reported in the Wall Street Journal:\n\n“A fundamental flaw in the freewheeling Texas electricity market left millions powerless and freezing in the dark this week during a historic cold snap. The core problem: Power providers can reap rewards by supplying electricity to Texas customers, but they aren’t required to do it and face no penalties for failing to deliver during a lengthy emergency. That led to the fiasco that left millions of people in the nation’s second-most-populous state without power for days. A severe storm paralyzed almost every energy source, from power plants to wind turbines, because their owners hadn’t made the investments needed to produce electricity in subfreezing temperatures. While power providers collectively failed, the companies themselves didn’t break any rules.”\n\nThe quest for efficiency and low cost led to under-investment and energy facilities poorly prepared for cold weather. Texas does better in hot weather, but climate change is altering weather patterns and extreme weather events are becoming more common. While we need to mitigate climate change and will need government-driven public policy to do that, we must also adapt to the climate change that is already underway. That need to adapt also requires a more active government presence than the ideologues running Texas want to allow.\n\nEnergy is not the only industry damaged by uncontrolled market forces. Health care is also suffering from the impact of health insurance companies on hospitals and medical care. The shortage of intensive care beds during the COVID-19 pandemic can be traced to efforts to enhance cost-effectiveness in hospitals. Extra capacity is considered waste that must be reflected in the price of care. Eliminate that capacity and costs can be reduced. Instead of paying for and storing extra personal protective equipment, hospitals utilize just-in-time supply chains to meet immediate needs. The system worked well until a pandemic hit and the supply chains could not meet dramatically increased demand.\n\nI am not arguing against just-in-time production or global supply chains, but rather for adequate public investment in infrastructure and supplies to meet the needs of emergencies. The public interest requires rules that may inhibit unfettered markets, but if regulations are designed with care, we can retain the benefits brought by the competitive marketplace. In some instances, we won’t need regulation but instead, require public infrastructure investment. For example, a more resilient electric grid could consist of thousands of microgrids knitted together into a national smart grid. Some of the capital for rebuilding the grid could come from federal infrastructure investment- the type needed to revive the American economy. The modern grid will produce energy at lower costs, making our economy more productive. A more robust system of public health will require enhanced local virus testing, tracing and isolation capacity and biological scanning of air travelers by the TSA. Travelers can fund the TSA, but local taxes will need to pay for local public health capacity.\n\nTo resume and maintain our way of life in a complex, interconnected global economy, we will need to develop a set of rules and build the institutional capacity needed to protect us from 21st-century threats. These range from terrorism to pandemics to the impact of extreme weather events. Our ability to enjoy the benefits of modern technology requires that public management become more effective and efficient. It is time to reject the idea that government is the problem and the solution to our problems is to “starve the beast” and disinvest in the public sector. That may have been an answer to some of the issues faced by Ronald Reagan and his contemporaries in 1980, but it is completely inadequate to the issues we are facing four decades later.\n\nDeregulation has failed. But reimposing rigid rules is unlikely to result in better outcomes. We need to develop incentives and disincentives that result in private behaviors that meet the requirements of the public interest. Some of that is pure command and control regulation. Every traffic system requires some traffic lights. But, tax credits and deductions, public investments, government-funded research and other forms of subsidies must be designed to achieve public ends rather than reward powerful interests. This will not be easy to do. We need to develop regulatory strategies that incentivize private behaviors to meet public needs. One size does not fit all, and we need to recognize that in formulating and implementing regulation.\n\nOur ability to measure performance is far greater than it was in the middle of the 20th century. The technology of observation, communication and information has advanced dramatically and can enable more targeted and effective rules. Remote sensing can replace human inspections and some auditing functions can be automated. We need to apply ingenuity and design to more effective and flexible policies and public investments. Effective public management requires financial investment, brainpower and political will. We should use the market to meet our needs rather than worship the market as the solution to all problems.\n\nA year of COVID-19 lockdown has demonstrated the inadequacy of what remains of our public sector. Our unwillingness to tax ourselves and invest in public sector infrastructure or organizational capacity has resulted in disease, death and trillions of dollars of economic damage. Last week in Texas, the free market in energy delivered cold and misery. For the past year, we have struggled to contain a virus that could have been isolated and eliminated with a more robust, competent system of public health. The benefits of modern technology bring costs. We need to understand those negative impacts and protect ourselves from them.\n\nIn a world where disinformation abounds and reality has become controversial, it will be a challenge to develop a more sophisticated, fact-based system of governance. A large number of Americans do not believe that our climate is changing and do not believe that COVID-19 is real. They think that Donald Trump’s reelection was stolen by nefarious forces and that the January 6th insurrection was led by Antifa. Despite these fact-free accounts, hundreds of insurrectionists are headed to courtrooms, thousands of COVID victims have died and millions of climate deniers in Texas suffered last week from the impact of climate-induced extreme weather. My hope is that Americans will accept reality and reject ideology. We need pragmatism and we need to be willing to pay the hand we are dealt. We saw signs of that in the recent election and in the poll data that indicates 70% of the country favors the Biden pandemic relief package. America’s government is a sleeping giant that seems to be slowly waking up from decades of slumber.\n\nViews and opinions expressed here are those of the authors, and do not necessarily reflect the official position of the Columbia Climate School, Earth Institute or Columbia University.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nOver 2 million Texas residents were left without electricity.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

It was a surprise announcement for the trillion-dollar company, mainly because while Facebook has spent plenty of money and effort on virtual reality hardware, its social VR products have largely been short-lived failures and it had said barely anything about its beta Horizons social platform since announcing it more than a year-and-a-half earlier.\n\nIn August, Facebook organized an unusually large press push around a VR app designed to let people take meetings in VR. Zuckerberg hit the morning shows and dedicated a surprising amount of effort toward showcasing the small VR app.\n\nIn September, in a blog post called “Building the Metaverse Responsibly,” Facebook announced a $50 million fund dedicated toward investment in research “to ensure these products are developed responsibly.” This month, Facebook announced a smaller $10 million creator fund for developers on its nascent Horizon Worlds platform, and also detailed that it planned to hire a whopping 10,000 employees in the EU specifically to build out their metaverse platform.\n\nLast week, a story in The Verge floated that Facebook was mulling a name change to their corporate entity.\n\nUltimately, distancing the company’s core business from a product associated with the most problems is an unsurprising move for them, but changing its name to Meta will require Facebook to align its core brand with a product that could be years from relevancy and could encounter many failures on the way to potential mainstream success. Facebook still has 2.5 billion users, while their metaverse products likely have a few thousand users, at most.\n\nA major name change from one of tech’s biggest companies isn’t without precedent. In 2015, Google rolled out a new corporate structure of its own, creating a parent company known as Alphabet. Google remains a subsidiary of Alphabet, but colloquially most people still call anything having to do with the company or its subsidiaries “Google,” for better or worse. After almost two decades of building its brand and growing its products to almost three billion monthly users, Facebook can probably expect the same treatment.\n\nWhile Google wasn’t trying to put distance between itself and its own name, Facebook has very different reasons for a rebrand. The company’s business continues to soar, but its brand has taken a beating in recent years, from Russian election disinformation in 2016, to major privacy lapses like the Cambridge Analytica scandal and now the flurry of ongoing revelations from Frances Haugen, a former member of Facebook’s civic integrity team turned Facebook whistleblower.\n\nFacebook is also arguably under more regulatory scrutiny at the moment than any other company in the tech industry. In Congress, where lawmakers seldom agree on anything, Republicans and Democrats have united in their shared distaste for the company’s unfettered growth, cutthroat business tactics and concerns over Instagram’s detrimental effects on teen mental health.\n\nDuring a Senate hearing last week with TikTok, Snap and YouTube, each social media company scrambled to explicitly contrast their own business practices with Facebook. YouTube posited that it didn’t “prioritize profits over safety.” Snap pointed to its own focus on ephemeral conversations, while TikTok argued that it thinks carefully about the wellbeing of teen users. But the efforts by Facebook’s peers appeared to be in vain.\n\n“Being different from Facebook is not a defense,” Senator Richard Blumenthal said. “That bar is in the gutter.”\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nAndrew Bosworth announced the retirement of the Oculus name.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

He added that other countries “have taken advantage of us for many, many years.”\n\nEconomists’ estimates have been far more grim, with most predicting that the president’s sweeping tariffs and likely retaliation will slow U.S. economic growth, push up costs for consumers and make life difficult for businesses that depend on international supply chains.\n\nThe president’s measure is both consequential and complicated.\n\nWhat did the president just do?\n\nMr. Trump announced two big tariff plans that apply to most of the world. One component is a “base line” tariff of 10 percent that will apply broadly to nearly all U.S. imports, except for products coming from Canada and Mexico.\n\nThe second measure is what the president is calling a “reciprocal” tariff. That levy will apply to 57 countries that Mr. Trump says have high tariffs and other unfair economic practices that have hurt American exporters. He said this is a reciprocal tariff because it will match the way other countries treat the United States.\n\nBut the tariff that Mr. Trump announced is not actually based on other countries’ tariffs or other economic barriers to U.S. trade. The number is calculated based on the U.S. trade deficit, which is a measure of the difference between what the United States sells to a country and what it buys from it.\n\nThe reciprocal tariffs range from 1 percent to 40 percent and will be added to the 10 percent base line tariff.\n\nThe 10 percent tariffs will go into effect on Saturday, and the reciprocal rates next Wednesday.\n\nWhich countries were targeted most by the tariffs?\n\nThe tariffs put a heavy burden on some of America’s biggest trading partners, including China, Japan, Germany, India, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam.\n\nNotably, Canada and Mexico were not included. Mr. Trump hit those countries with a 25 percent tariff on many of their exports last month, though he also provided an exception for products that qualify for the trade agreement he signed in 2020, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. The countries are also subject to tariffs Mr. Trump has applied globally on cars, steel and aluminum, and the administration appears to have decided that America’s closest neighbors did not need further tariffs.\n\nBut the new tariffs will hit other allies with substantial levies. European goods will face a 20 percent tariff, Japanese goods will face 24 percent and South Korean products 26 percent.\n\nBecause of the way the tariff was calculated, Asian countries that send the United States a lot of exports but don’t buy much in return will see some of the highest rates.\n\nChinese exports face an extra 34 percent tariff. That is on top of a 20 percent tariff Mr. Trump applied in recent months and other levies from his first term. As a result, some products from China will face a tariff of 79 percent.\n\nVietnam — where many companies moved their factories after Mr. Trump put tariffs on China in his first term — will now face a 46 percent tariff on its exports, while Cambodian exports will be taxed at 49 percent.\n\nThe White House also did not apply tariffs to Russia, North Korea, Cuba and Belarus, arguing that these countries are already subject to heavy sanctions. But U.S. imports from Russia were $3 billion last year; small compared to many countries, but far larger than tiny countries like Lesotho and the Falkland Islands, which Mr. Trump chose to hit with substantial tariffs.\n\nWhat is the president’s goal?\n\nImage Mr. Trump said the tariffs will reverse decades of unfair treatment by the rest of the world and result in factories and jobs moving back to the United States. Credit... Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times\n\nThe president and his advisers say their goal is to make the tariffs so painful that they force companies to make their products in the United States. They argue that this will create more American jobs and push up wages.\n\n“If you want your tariff rate to be zero,” Mr. Trump said outside the White House on Wednesday, “then you build your product right here in America.”\n\nOne of the biggest questions is whether the president sees these tariffs as a negotiating tactic, and would be willing to remove them in return for concessions from other countries.\n\nThe administration has given mixed signals on that front. It seems unlikely that the president will remove the 10 percent base line tariff he has issued globally. And if the administration is truly looking for U.S. trade deficits with other countries to be eliminated, that may be difficult, if not impossible.\n\nBut in the executive order he signed, the president said that if countries eliminate their unfair trade practices, or the U.S. trade deficit with them drops, the reciprocal tariffs could be rolled back.\n\nHoward Lutnick, the commerce secretary, described other countries’ trade barriers as “the monster that needs to be slayed.”\n\n“Our teams are talking to all the great trading partners today,” Mr. Lutnick said Thursday on Bloomberg Television. “It is time for them to do deep soul-searching on how they treat us poorly and how to make it right.”\n\nHow did they come up with the numbers?\n\nMr. Trump said Wednesday that each nation’s tariff rate would be calculated based on “the combined rate of all their tariffs, non-monetary barriers and other forms of cheating.” But it turned out that their methodology revolved around something more straightforward: the gap between what America exports to a country and what it imports.\n\nThe White House put out a complicated-looking formula, but it boiled down to a simple ratio. Countries that send the U.S. more goods than they buy were deemed to have “unbalanced” trade and will face higher tariffs.\n\nThis formula doesn’t account for any comparative advantage, or the idea that countries trade goods because some are better at making some products than others, and that countries can trade to maximize their benefits. Instead, the administration’s point of view appears to be that any trade deficit is bad, and tariffs will be applied until it is eliminated.\n\nHow do the tariffs work?\n\nAs they go into effect over the next week, the tariffs will immediately increase the cost for importers bringing goods into the country. Typically, those importers are U.S. companies.\n\nFor example, if Walmart brings in a $10 shoe from Vietnam — which faces a 46 percent tariff — Walmart will owe $4.60 in additional tariffs to the U.S. government.\n\nIt’s less clear what happens next. Walmart could try to force the cost onto the Vietnamese shoe manufacturer, by telling it Walmart will pay less for the product. Walmart could cut into its own profit margins and absorb the cost of the tariff. Or, it could raise the price it sells shoes for at its stores, to make up the cost.\n\nEconomists found that, when Mr. Trump put tariffs on China in his first term, most of that cost was passed on to consumers. But economic studies found that the tariffs on steel were a bit different; only about half of those costs were passed on to customers.\n\nEstimates vary, but given the scale of Mr. Trump’s new tariffs, American households could see thousands of dollars of additional costs annually. An estimate released by the Yale Budget Lab, a research group, found that American households on average would pay an additional $2,100 because of the April 2 announcement, with poorer households paying a larger share of their income.\n\nThe particularly high tariffs that the Trump administration applied to many Asian countries means that the price of many consumer items will likely increase, including shoes, clothing and electronics.\n\nThe government will earn a lot more revenue from tariffs that the Trump administration has promised to channel into tax cuts. The value of tariffs for all the goods imported by the United States last year was $78 billion. With the new tariffs announced on Wednesday, the figure would skyrocket to more than $1 trillion, according to an analysis by Trade Partnership Worldwide, a research firm based in Washington.\n\nWhat happens next with the economy?\n\nThe tariff announcement triggered a global meltdown in stock markets, indicating that investors see it as significantly harmful for listed companies.\n\nIt is not yet clear whether, or how, other countries will retaliate. But if they impose their own tariffs on U.S. products, that will likely hurt U.S. exporters and could spark escalating trade wars.\n\nMany analysts quickly downgraded their forecasts for economic growth, saying that tariffs would push up prices for consumers and costs for businesses, slowing demand and economic activity.\n\nNancy Lazar, chief global economist at Piper Sandler, estimated the U.S. economy might contract 1 percent in the second quarter. She had previously expected a flat quarter. “It’s an immediate hit to the economy,” she said.\n\nEconomists at Fitch Ratings said in a note Thursday that the tariffs had significantly raised the risk for a recession in the United States. It said that tariffs would result in higher consumer prices that would squeeze real wages and weigh on consumer spending.\n\nThe tariffs would also lead to lower corporate profits, which, along with policy uncertainty, would drag on business investment in the United States. Altogether, the effect would “likely outweigh the benefits U.S. companies might gain from increased protection against foreign competition,” Fitch economists said.\n\nLazaro Gamio and Colby Smith contributed reporting.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nThe S&P 500 fell below its 200-day moving average on Monday.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Was this an exaggerated response, or do stablecoins indeed represent a genuine threat to the future expansion of Visa and Mastercard?\n\n## Stablecoins Threat to Payment Networks\n\nStablecoins represent a segment of cryptocurrencies aimed at maintaining a stable value in comparison to fiat currencies, such as the U.S. dollar. Essentially, stablecoins integrate the U.S. dollar within the blockchain — merging the reliability and stability of fiat with the rapidity, transparency, and programmability associated with crypto. Increasingly, stablecoins are viewed as a method of payment and not merely as a repository for digital cash. The new stablecoin legislation marks a significant victory for the crypto sector, as it lays down a structure to regulate digital tokens linked to the dollar, with stipulations including complete reserve backing for issuers, monthly audits, and compliance with anti-money laundering laws. Such initiatives could aid in establishing greater legitimacy for cryptocurrencies and increase mainstream acceptance. This may also allow non-financial entities, such as large retailers, to create their own dollar-pegged stablecoins under federal regulation.\n\nThe consequences of this development are considerable. Merchants are likely to be drawn to the capacity of stablecoins to lower processing expenses by sidestepping traditional payment networks like Visa and Mastercard. Unlike credit card transactions, which incur interchange fees and experience multi-day settlement delays, stablecoin payments can finalize almost instantly. See: __Can Stablecoin issuer Circle stock reach $300? __\n\nThis threat became increasingly concrete this week with the introduction of major crypto exchange Coinbase's Coinbase Payments platform. The platform enables merchants to easily accept USDC stablecoin payments. Similar to credit cards, the system alleviates much of the cost and complexity involved in traditional processing. Coinbase is focusing on e-commerce giants such as Shopify and eBay for its deployment since this gives it access to thousands of small and medium-sized enterprises that are likely to be more price sensitive. The Wall Street Journal disclosed that Walmart and Amazon have been investigating the possibility of issuing their own stablecoins in the U.S. These high-volume retailers would benefit even more from stablecoins. In addition to the cost benefits that stablecoin transactions could provide, these retailers might possess greater leverage to negotiate lower interchange fees with Visa and Mastercard. This could result in savings of potentially billions in fees and enhance profitability. The revenue stream that is most vulnerable for Visa and Mastercard is likely cross-border payments, where fees are elevated and settlement is slower. Stablecoins can handle these transactions significantly more quickly and economically, posing a threat to a primary source of profit for the card networks.\n\n## Not An Immediate Shift\n\nNonetheless, the transition will not be instant, and we do not believe stablecoins will replace card networks in the near future. Credit cards have become integral to consumers' lives and are deeply rooted in consumer behavior, offering not just convenience and familiarity but also access to credit and loyalty rewards, which stablecoins currently do not provide. Regulatory ambiguity, user confidence, and wallet infrastructure issues present additional barriers to the widespread adoption of stablecoins at this time. Furthermore, Visa and Mastercard are exploring innovations in the stablecoin arena.

An uncontrolled collapse of Credit Suisse would lead to incalculable consequences for the country and the international financial system.\"\n\nCredit Suisse is designated by the Financial Stability Board, an international body that monitors the global financial system, as one of the world’s globally systemic important banks. This means regulators believe its uncontrolled failure would lead to ripples throughout the financial system not unlike the collapse of Lehman Brothers 15 years ago.\n\nMarkets remain jittery despite the best efforts of regulators to restore calm. Shares fell Monday in Asia, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng index down 2.7% and Tokyo's benchmark Nikkei 225 losing 1.2%. Bank shares in the region were lower and futures in London and Frankfurt also fell.\n\nSunday's news conference follows the collapse of two large US banks last week that spurred a frantic, broad response from the US government to prevent any further bank panics. Still, global financial markets have been on edge since Credit Suisse's share price began plummeting this week.\n\nThe 167-year-old Credit Suisse already received a $50 billion (54 million Swiss francs) loan from the Swiss National Bank, which briefly caused a rally in the bank's stock price. Yet the move did not appear to be enough to stem an outflow of deposits, according to news reports.\n\nStill, many of Credit Suisse's problems are unique and do not overlap with the weaknesses that brought down Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, whose failures led to a significant rescue effort by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Reserve. As a result, their downfall does not necessarily signal the start of a financial crisis similar to what occurred in 2008.\n\nThe deal caps a highly volatile week for Credit Suisse, most notably on Wednesday when its shares plunged to a record low after its largest investor, the Saudi National Bank, said it wouldn't invest any more money into the bank to avoid tripping regulations that would kick in if its stake rose about 10%.\n\nFollowing news of the Swiss deal, the world’s central banks announced coordinated moves to stabilize banks, including access to a lending facility for banks to borrow U.S. dollars if they need them, a practice widely used during the 2008 crisis. Three months after Lehman Brothers collapsed in September of 2008, such swap lines had been tapped for $580 billion. Swap lines also were rolled out during market turmoil in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nColm Kelleher, the UBS chairman, hailed \"enormous opportunities\" from the takeover and highlighted his bank’s \"conservative risk culture\" – a subtle swipe at Credit Suisse's reputation for more swashbuckling gambles in search of bigger returns. He said the combined group would create a wealth manager with over $5 trillion in total invested assets.\n\nOn Friday, shares dropped 8% to close at 1.86 francs ($2) on the Swiss exchange. The stock has seen a long downward slide: It traded at more than 80 francs in 2007.\n\nIts current troubles began after Credit Suisse reported on Tuesday that managers had identified \"material weaknesses\" in the bank’s internal controls on financial reporting as of the end of last year. That fanned fears that Credit Suisse would be the next domino to fall.\n\nWhile smaller than its Swiss rival UBS, Credit Suisse still wields considerable influence, with $1.4 trillion assets under management. The firm has significant trading desks around the world, caters to the rich and wealthy through its wealth management business, and is a major advisor for global companies in mergers and acquisitions. Notably, Credit Suisse did not need government assistance in 2008 during the financial crisis, while UBS did.\n\nDespite the banking turmoil, the European Central Bank on Thursday approved a large, half-percentage point increase in interest rates to try to curb stubbornly high inflation, saying Europe’s banking sector is \"resilient,\" with strong finances.\n\nECB President Christine Lagarde said the banks \"are in a completely different position from 2008\" during the financial crisis, partly because of stricter government regulation.\n\nThe Swiss bank has been pushing to raise money from investors and roll out a new strategy to overcome an array of troubles, including bad bets on hedge funds, repeated shake-ups of its top management and a spying scandal involving UBS.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nCredit Suisse's board rebuffed the proposal from UBS.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA. Investors and depositors withdrew billions from Credit Suisse.\nB. Saudi National Bank stated it would not increase funding to Credit Suisse.\nC.

The #MeToo movement went viral, spurring a national and global discussion on the issue.\n\nMany women have since come forward with their experiences of being sexually harassed by colleagues and bosses, costing influential men in the entertainment industry and the media — including journalists here at NPR — their jobs.\n\nAnd yet, there has been little data collected on the national prevalence of sexual harassment, says Michele Decker, director of the women's health and rights program at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. As a result, many people have asked, \"Where's the evidence?\" she says.\n\nNow an online survey launched in January by a nonprofit called Stop Street Harassment offers some of that missing evidence. It found that 81 percent of women and 43 percent of men had experienced some form of sexual harassment during their lifetime.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThose numbers are much larger than suggested by other recent polls. Those polls used a more limited sample or narrower definitions of harassment, says Anita Raj, director of the Center on Gender Equity and Health at the University of California, San Diego, who analyzed the results of the new survey.\n\nThe new survey, on the other hand, included a larger, more nationally representative sample of men and women ages 18 and above, says Raj.\n\nThe survey also involved a broader definition of sexual harassment that includes the \"continuum of experiences\" that women face, she says.\n\nLoading...\n\nThat includes verbal forms of sexual harassment, like being catcalled or whistled at or getting unwanted comments of a sexual nature. It also includes physical harassment, cyber harassment and sexual assaults.\n\nThe results, released in a report Wednesday, show that 77 percent of women had experienced verbal sexual harassment, and 51 percent had been sexually touched without their permission. About 41 percent said they had been sexually harassed online, and 27 percent said they had survived sexual assault.\n\nThe report also looked into locations where people experienced harassment. The majority of women — 66 percent — said they'd been sexually harassed in public spaces. \"The public forums are where you see the more chronic experiences of sexual harassment,\" says Raj. These include verbal harassment and physical harassment, like touching and groping.\n\nHowever, 38 percent of women said they experienced sexual harassment at the workplace. Thirty-five percent said they had experienced it at their residence. These experiences are more likely to be assaults and the \"most severe forms\" of harassment, says Raj.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"The findings show that this is a pervasive problem and permeates all sectors of our lives,\" says Holly Kearl, the main author of the report. \"Most people who said they had experienced sexual harassment experienced it in multiple locations.\"\n\n\"Sexual harassment until more recently has been viewed as part and parcel of what people experienced,\" says Decker, who wasn't involved in the survey. As a result, public health researchers don't monitor it. \"It's often been dismissed, because it's considered not as egregious as sexual assault or rape.\"\n\nRape and sexual violence are closely monitored by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey. As a result, public health agencies and health workers are more aware of their prevalence and have been able to take steps to help victims and offer programs aimed at preventing sexual violence.\n\nThe new report shows that sexual harassment, too, is worth monitoring, says Decker. \"We want to know that we're responding to things that are prevalent and common, and this is showing that sexual harassment is really prevalent.\"\n\nLoading...\n\nOne of the most striking findings from the report is that there is a very clear \"gender differential,\" she says. While men experience sexual harassment as well, the prevalence is higher for women, as is the intensity of those experiences. It also shows that men are more frequently the perpetrators, she adds.\n\nKearl says she was surprised at how few of the victims confronted their harasser. Instead, they changed their own lives to avoid harassers and reduce their risks of being harassed.\n\n\"They were changing their routes or routines; they were changing jobs, or moving,\" says Kearl.\n\nThe report also shows that most victims suffer from anxiety and depression as well, just like victims of sexual violence. \"It shows how challenging it is to confront someone. You'd rather change your life than confront the harasser,\" she says.\n\nRaj says her own teenage daughter's experience illustrates this. A couple of years ago, her daughter stopped walking to the public library by herself after she was harassed by a group of boys.\n\nLoading...\n\n\"She was walking from her high school in a very privileged, affluent area, an area that most people would define as very safe,\" Raj recalls. \"As she was walking alone around 3 o'clock in the afternoon, there was a group of boys that started calling out to her and saying things like 'nice hips.' And it just made her feel so uncomfortable [that] she didn't walk alone anymore.\"\n\nLike Raj's daughter, most women (and men) first experience sexual harassment pretty early in life — during preteen or teenage years. \"That's really disconcerting,\" says Raj.\n\nSimilarly disconcerting is the fact that most victims don't report their experiences, says Decker. \"People don't even mention it to friends, families.\" And so, sexual harassment is \"thriving on the silence of women,\" granting impunity to perpetrators, she says.\n\nSome of that has been turned upside down by the #MeToo movement, because it broke that silence and made it more culturally acceptable to talk about sexual harassment.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"The next wave of this is to really understand ... what are the barriers to people being able to access reporting process?\" says Decker. \"How can we support people who want to report this if they so choose?\"\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nWomen used social media to share sexual harassment experiences in October 2017, leading to the #MeToo movement going viral.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert at causal reasoning."}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n### CONTEXT\n[Doc 1]\nTitle: August 22, 2021\nContent: A week after the Taliban took control of Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, as the U.S. was withdrawing the forces that have been in the country since 2001, the initial chaos created by the Taliban’s rapid sweep across the country has simmered down into what is at least a temporary pattern.\n\nWe knew there was a good chance that the Taliban would regain control of the country when we left, although that was not a foregone conclusion. The former president, Donald Trump, recognized that the American people were tired of the ongoing war in Afghanistan, which was approaching its 20th year, and in February 2020, his administration negotiated with the Taliban to enable the U.S. to withdraw. In exchange for the release of 5000 Taliban fighters and the promise that the U.S. would withdraw within the next 14 months, the Taliban agreed not to attack U.S. soldiers.\n\nTrump’s dislike of the war in Afghanistan reflected the unpopularity of the long engagement, which by 2020 was ill defined. The war had begun in 2001, after terrorists affiliated with al-Qaeda attacked the United States on September 11 of that year. Taliban leaders in control of Afghanistan sheltered al-Qaeda, and after the attacks, the U.S. president, George W. Bush, demanded that Afghanistan hand over the terrorist leader believed to be behind the terrorist attack on the U.S: Osama bin Laden. In October, after Taliban leaders refused, the U.S. launched a bombing campaign.\n\nThat campaign was successful enough that in December 2001 the Taliban offered to surrender. But the U.S. rejected that surrender, determined by then to eradicate the extremist group and fill the vacuum of its collapse with a new, pro-American government. Al-Qaeda leader bin Laden escaped from Afghanistan to Pakistan, and the U.S. project in Afghanistan turned from an anti-terrorism mission into an effort to rebuild the Afghan government into a modern democracy.\n\nBy 2002 the Bush administration was articulating a new doctrine in foreign policy, arguing that the U.S. had a right to strike preemptively against countries that harbor terrorists. In 2003, under this doctrine, the U.S. launched a war on Iraq, which diverted money, troops, and attention from Afghanistan. The Taliban regrouped and began to regain the territory it had lost after the U.S. first began its bombing campaign in 2001.\n\nBy 2005, Bush administration officials privately worried the war in Afghanistan could not be won on its current terms, especially with the U.S. focused on Iraq. Then, when he took office in 2009, President Barack Obama turned his attention back to Afghanistan. He threw more troops into that country, bringing their numbers close to 100,000. In 2011, the U.S. military located bin Laden in Abbottabad, Pakistan, and launched a raid on the compound where he was hiding, killing him. By 2014, Obama had drawn troops in Afghanistan down to about 11,000, and in December of that year, he announced that the mission of the war—weakening the Taliban and capturing bin Laden—had been accomplished, and thus the war was over. The troops would come home.\n\nBut, of course, they didn’t, leaving Trump to develop his own policy. But his administration’s approach to the chaos in that country was different than his predecessor’s. By negotiating with the Taliban and excluding the Afghan government the U.S. had been supporting, the Trump team essentially accepted that the Taliban were the most important party in Afghanistan. The agreement itself reflected the oddity of the negotiations. Each clause referring to the Taliban began: “The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan which is not recognized by the United States as a state and is known as the Taliban will….”\n\nIt was immediately clear that the Taliban was not living up to its side of the bargain. Although it did stop attacking U.S. troops, It began to escalate violence in Afghanistan itself, assassinated political opponents, and maintained ties to al-Qaeda. Nonetheless, the Trump administration put pressure on the leaders of the Afghan government to release the 5000 Taliban prisoners, and they eventually did. Before Biden took office, Trump dropped the U.S. troop engagement in Afghanistan from about 13,000 to about 2500.\n\nWhen he took office, Biden had to decide whether to follow Trump’s path or to push back on the Taliban on the grounds they were not honoring the agreement Trump’s people had hammered out. Biden himself wanted to get out of the war. At the same time, he recognized that fighting the Taliban again would mean throwing more troops back into Afghanistan, and that the U.S. would again begin to take casualties. He opted to get the troops out, but extended the deadline to September 11, 2021, the twentieth anniversary of the initial attack. (Former president Trump complained that the troops should come out faster.)\n\nWhat Biden did not foresee was the speed with which the Taliban would retake control of the country. It swept over the regional capitals and then Kabul in about nine days in mid-August with barely a shot fired, and the head of the Afghan government fled the country, leaving it in chaos.\n\nThat speed left the U.S. flatfooted. Afghans who had been part of the government or who had helped the U.S. and its allies rushed to the airport to try to escape. In the pandemonium of that first day, up to seven people were killed; two people appear to have clung to a U.S. military plane as it took off, falling to their deaths.\n\nAnd yet, the Taliban, so far, has promised amnesty for its former opponents and limited rights for women. It has its own problems, as the Afghan government has been supported for the previous 20 years by foreign money, including a large percentage from the U.S. Not only has that money dried up as foreign countries refuse to back the Taliban, but also Biden has put sanctions on Afghanistan and also on some Pakistanis suspected of funding the Taliban. At the same time it appears that no other major sponsor, like Russia or China, has stepped in to fill the vacuum left by U.S. money, leaving the Taliban fishing for whatever goodwill it can find.\n\nYesterday, Josh Marshall of Talking Points Memo flagged tweets showing that members of the Afghan government, including the brother of the president who fled, are in what appear from the photos posted on Twitter to be relaxed talks about forming a new government. Other factions in Afghanistan would like to stop this from happening, and today Biden’s national security adviser Jake Sullivan warned that ISIS-K, another extremist group, is threatening to attack the airport to destabilize the Taliban.\n\nMeanwhile, there are 10,000 people crowded into that airport, and U.S. evacuations continue. The Kabul airport is secure—for now—and the U.S. military has created a larger perimeter around it for protection. The U.S. government has asked Americans in Afghanistan to shelter in place until they can be moved out safely; the Qatari ambassador to Afghanistan has been escorting groups of them to the airport. Evacuations have been slower than hoped because of backlogs at the next stage of the journey, but the government has enlisted the help of 18 commercial airlines to move those passengers forward, leaving room for new evacuees.\n\nYesterday, about 7800 evacuees left the Kabul airport. About 28,000 have been evacuated since August 14.\n\nInterestingly, much of the U.S. media is describing this scenario as a disaster for President Biden. Yet, on CNN this morning, Matthew Dowd, who was the chief strategist for the Bush-Cheney ticket in 2004, noted that more than 20,000 people have been evacuated from Afghanistan without a single loss of an American life, while in the same period of time, 5000 Americans have died from Covid-19 and 500 have died from gunshots.\n\n—-\n\nNotes:\n\nhttps://www.npr.org/2020/02/29/810537586/u-s-signs-peace-deal-with-taliban-after-nearly-2-decades-of-war-in-afghanistan\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2021/08/12/obama-afghan-war-ending-afghanistan-papers-book-excerpt/\n\nhttps://www.factcheck.org/2021/08/timeline-of-u-s-withdrawal-from-afghanistan/\n\nhttps://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/you-wouldnt-know-it-from-the-us-news-coverage-but\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/16/kabul-airport-chaos-and-panic-as-afghans-and-foreigners-attempt-to-flee-the-capital\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2021/08/22/afghanistan-biden-evacuations/\n\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2021/08/21/politics/kabul-airport-terror-warning/index.html\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/08/17/treasury-taliban-money-afghanistan/\n\nShare\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nTaliban militants captured several provincial capitals, including Zaranj, Sheberghan, Kunduz, Sar-e Pol, Taloqan, and Aybak, between August 6 and August 9.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Police respond to a call about a man who allegedly used a counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes. Seventeen minutes later, the man they are there to investigate lies motionless on the ground, and is pronounced dead shortly after. The man was 46-year-old George Floyd, a bouncer originally from Houston who had lost his job at a restaurant when the coronavirus pandemic hit. Crowd: “No justice, no peace.” Floyd’s death triggered major protests in Minneapolis, and sparked rage across the country. One of the officers involved, Derek Chauvin, has been arrested and charged with second-degree murder. The other three officers have been charged with aiding and abetting murder. The Times analyzed bystander videos, security camera footage and police scanner audio, spoke to witnesses and experts, and reviewed documents released by the authorities to build as comprehensive a picture as possible and better understand how George Floyd died in police custody. The events of May 25 begin here. Floyd is sitting in the driver’s seat of this blue S.U.V. Across the street is a convenience store called Cup Foods. Footage from this restaurant security camera helps us understand what happens next. Note that the timestamp on the camera is 24 minutes fast. At 7:57 p.m., two employees from Cup Foods confront Floyd and his companions about an alleged counterfeit bill he just used in their store to buy cigarettes. They demand the cigarettes back but walk away empty-handed. Four minutes later, they call the police. According to the 911 transcript, an employee says that Floyd used fake bills to buy cigarettes, and that he is “awfully drunk” and “not in control of himself.” Soon, the first police vehicle arrives on the scene. Officers Thomas Lane and J. Alexander Kueng step out of the car and approach the blue S.U.V. Seconds later, Lane pulls his gun. We don’t know exactly why. He orders Floyd to put his hands on the wheel. Lane reholsters the gun, and after about 90 seconds of back and forth, yanks Floyd out of the S.U.V. A man is filming the confrontation from a car parked behind them. The officers cuff Floyd’s hands behind his back. And Kueng walks him to the restaurant wall. “All right, what’s your name?” From the 911 transcript and the footage, we now know three important facts: First, that the police believed they were responding to a man who was drunk and out of control. But second, even though the police were expecting this situation, we can see that Floyd has not acted violently. And third, that he seems to already be in distress. Six minutes into the arrest, the two officers move Floyd back to their vehicle. As the officers approach their car, we can see Floyd fall to the ground. According to the criminal complaints filed against the officers, Floyd says he is claustrophobic and refuses to enter the police car. During the struggle, Floyd appears to turn his head to address the officers multiple times. According to the complaints, he tells them he can’t breathe. Nine minutes into the arrest, the third and final police car arrives on the scene. It’s carrying officers Tou Thao and Derek Chauvin. Both have previous records of complaints brought against them. Thao was once sued for throwing a man to the ground and hitting him. Chauvin has been involved in three police shootings, one of them fatal. Chauvin becomes involved in the struggle to get Floyd into the car. Security camera footage from Cup Foods shows Kueng struggling with Floyd in the backseat while Thao watches. Chauvin pulls him through the back seat and onto the street. We don’t know why. Floyd is now lying on the pavement, face down. That’s when two witnesses begin filming, almost simultaneously. The footage from the first witness shows us that all four officers are now gathered around Floyd. It’s the first moment when we can clearly see that Floyd is face down on the ground, with three officers applying pressure to his neck, torso and legs. At 8:20 p.m., we hear Floyd’s voice for the first time. The video stops when Lane appears to tell the person filming to walk away. “Get off to the sidewalk, please. One side or the other, please.” The officers radio a Code 2, a call for non-emergency medical assistance, reporting an injury to Floyd’s mouth. In the background, we can hear Floyd struggling. The call is quickly upgraded to a Code 3, a call for emergency medical assistance. By now another bystander, 17-year-old Darnella Frazier, is filming from a different angle. Her footage shows that despite calls for medical help, Chauvin keeps Floyd pinned down for another seven minutes. We can’t see whether Kueng and Lane are still applying pressure. Floyd: [gasping] Officer: “What do you want?” Bystander: “I’ve been —” Floyd: [gasping] In the two videos, Floyd can be heard telling officers that he can’t breathe at least 16 times in less than five minutes. Bystander: “You having fun?” But Chauvin never takes his knee off of Floyd, even as his eyes close and he appears to go unconscious. Bystander: “Bro.” According to medical and policing experts, these four police officers are committing a series of actions that violate policies, and in this case, turn fatal. They’ve kept Floyd lying face down, applying pressure for at least five minutes. This combined action is likely compressing his chest and making it impossible to breathe. Chauvin is pushing his knee into Floyd’s neck, a move banned by most police departments. Minneapolis Police Department policy states an officer can only do this if someone is, quote, “actively resisting.” And even though the officers call for medical assistance, they take no action to treat Floyd on their own while waiting for the ambulance to arrive. Officer: “Get back on the sidewalk.” According to the complaints against the officers, Lane asks him twice if they should roll Floyd onto his side. Chauvin says no. Twenty minutes into the arrest, an ambulance arrives on the scene. Bystander: “Get off of his neck!” Bystander: “He’s still on him?” The E.M.T.s check Floyd’s pulse. Bystander: “Are you serious?” Chauvin keeps his knee on Floyd’s neck for almost another whole minute, even though Floyd appears completely unresponsive. He only gets off once the E.M.T.s tell him to. Chauvin kept his knee on Floyd’s neck for over eight minutes, according to our review of the video evidence. Floyd is loaded into the ambulance. The ambulance leaves the scene, possibly because a crowd is forming. But the E.M.T.s call for additional medical help from the fire department. But when the engine arrives, the officers give them, quote, “no clear info on Floyd or his whereabouts,” according to a fire department incident report. This delays their ability to help the paramedics. Meanwhile, Floyd is going into cardiac arrest. It takes the engine five minutes to reach Floyd in the ambulance. He’s pronounced dead at a nearby hospital around 9:25 p.m. Preliminary autopsies conducted by the state and Floyd’s family both ruled his death a homicide. The widely circulated arrest videos don’t paint the entire picture of what happened to George Floyd. Crowd: “Floyd! Floyd!” Additional video and audio from the body cameras of the key officers would reveal more about why the struggle began and how it escalated. The city quickly fired all four officers. And Chauvin has been charged with second degree murder. Thomas Lane, J. Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao were charged with aiding and abetting murder. But outrage over George Floyd’s death has only spread further and further across the United States.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nThree former Minneapolis police officers were criminally charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder in connection with Floyd's death, and Chauvin's charge was upgraded to second-degree murder.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

The dangerous storm, part of a series of weather systems sweeping the country this week, resulted in accumulating snow and ice across a wide swath of states that rarely see wintry precipitation, including heavily populated areas of Texas. The storm knocked out power to more than 4 million households in Texas, raising questions about the durability of the power grid in the United States’ second-most-populated state, and one of its fastest growing.\n\nThe electricity issues, which authorities warned could in some places persist for days, resulted in blackouts that prevented residents from being able to heat their homes, cook meals or work remotely. The power cuts even knocked out electricity at a Houston-area warehouse where 8,000 doses of coronavirus vaccine were stored, forcing health officials to rush to distribute 4,000 of them to anyone they could before the doses spoiled.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n“The Texas electric system is facing an unprecedented power shortage situation due to the extreme winter weather impacting the entire state, including Houston & the region,” CenterPoint Energy, which serves more than 2 million customers in the Houston area, said in a statement Monday. “Texans’ electricity consumption needs have far surpassed current power generation.”\n\nThe severity of the blackouts, which analysts said were a sign that governments and utility companies did not prepare adequately for the storm, were traced to soaring consumer demand for heat as well as the inherent dangers that extreme cold poses for Southern power systems that were built to handle summer heat over frigid winter.\n\n“To see this kind of impact on a wide scale across the grid is very unusual, particularly in the winter,” said Rebecca Miller, a Texas energy analyst for Wood Mackenzie consulting firm. Miller said the rolling blackouts on Monday are the only things that prevented the state’s electricity transmission from collapsing. “But I was expecting a little bit more preparation. . . . What we really saw was a bit more of a reactive response than a proactive one.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Texas, rolling blackouts were also reported in the major population centers of Houston, Dallas, Austin and San Antonio, where snow and sleet reached the Alamo. Snow even accumulated on the beach in Galveston, a city where residents are far more accustomed to hurricanes than they are to wintry weather.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAs power outages in Texas multiplied on Monday afternoon, even as the snow had stopped in most places, Gov. Greg Abbott (R) went on Twitter to push back at suggestions that the state was facing a catastrophic power failure. Abbott also activated the National Guard to help usher residents to 135 warming locations.\n\n“The Texas power grid has not been compromised,” Abbott wrote. “The ability of some companies that generate the power has been frozen. This includes the natural gas & coal generators. They are working to get generation back on line.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut across the state, even residents of major cities were forced to rethink some of the basics to get through the day.\n\nSayra De La Cruz, 37, said she and her boyfriend woke up in Houston on Monday morning without electricity and no water because of frozen pipes. Without a way to flush the toilets, she decided to collect snow and melt enough of it for two flushes.\n\n“It’s definitely hard because the shoveling in itself — that’s some cardio right there,” said De La Cruz, adding that she was filling both of her bathtubs with snow so it can melt slowly.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nOklahoma Gas and Electric, the state’s largest utility, also announced Monday that it implemented intermittent controlled service interruptions — an unprecedented measure for the company. The blackouts were in effect for about two hours, but they may return depending on capacity, spokesman Brian Alford said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the storm moved north into the Ohio Valley on Monday afternoon, so did the problems.\n\nIn Louisiana, icy conditions prompted authorities to close dozens of highways and bridges, including sections of Interstate 10. Icy roads were reported in at least 74 of Mississippi’s 84 counties, which Gov. Tate Reeves (R) told the Weather Channel was complicating efforts to restore power to more than 61,000 residents. In Arkansas, Little Rock was paralyzed by a two-inch-per-hour snowfall rate, the National Weather Service reported.\n\nIn Kentucky, Gov. Andy Beshear (D) sent the National Guard door to door in remote rural communities to urge residents — some of whom have been without power since a storm last week — to move into shelters. Beshear urged everyone to take the storm seriously.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“We did not make it through almost a year of a pandemic to lose people to a snow or ice storm,” Beshear said in a televised address. “You have more ability to work remotely. You have more ways to connect to one another and get things done. We are looking at coming out of this pandemic by summer, so please do not let the next couple of days or this week be what injures you or causes the loss of a loved one.”\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAt one point Monday, the Weather Service had winter storm warnings issued from Brownsville, Tex., along the U.S.-Mexico border to Caribou, Maine, a distance of more than 2,500 miles.\n\nIn New York, where every county was under a winter weather advisory or warning Monday night, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) urged residents to stay home.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the residents of the South have been hardest hit by the storm, which meteorologists warn could be replicated in the coming days as another storm system is predicted to follow a similar track and collide with a cold snap.\n\nThe bitter cold is affecting about 30 states, with temperatures as much as 50 degrees below normal.\n\nGeorge Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston dipped to 17 degrees early Monday, the coldest reading observed there since Dec. 23, 1989. Tuesday’s morning low could be even more frigid: the Weather Service forecast is 11. The wind chill on Tuesday morning is expected to be 1.\n\n“Dangerous life and property threatening bitterly cold air will continue even as the precipitation ends,” the Weather Service in Houston wrote early Monday.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nFarther north, wind chills early Monday plunged as low as minus-40 and minus-50 in parts of Nebraska, Kansas and Colorado.\n\nIn Texas, the power outages were tied to record-high demand, an electrical grid that is independent from surrounding states, low natural-gas supplies, along with sky-high prices, and reduced output from the state’s wind turbines.\n\nThe Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), the umbrella organization that oversees the state’s power grid, warned that it would continue to implement mainly short-term, rolling blackouts across the state.\n\nThere have been three in­stances of rotating outages during an Energy Emergency Alert because of weather events in Texas, with the first occurring in 1989, according to ERCOT. Energy demand in the Lone Star State is expected to hit an all-time high.­\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Monday evening, 4.3 million outages were reported in Texas — more than one-third of customers in the state, according to poweroutage.us.\n\n“Every grid operator and every electric company is fighting to restore power right now,” ERCOT president and chief executive Bill Magness said.\n\nMiller, the Texas energy analyst, said the strain on Texas’s power grid was more reminiscent of the types of failures that could occur during a major hurricane. But even there, Miller noted, those hurricane-related power failures are usually limited to a specific corner of the state. This threat encompasses nearly the entire state.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nJesse Jenkins, an assistant professor of engineering at Princeton’s Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment, said the extreme weather pushed Texas’s energy capabilities past the breaking point as chilled Texans tried to heat their homes.\n\nThe state was already dealing with higher seasonal demand because of the pandemic, with more people at home drawing power instead of clustered in work­places during the day, Jenkins added.\n\nThe outcome of the current power crisis will force a discussion about the future of the Texas energy system and raise questions about the state’s outlier approach to power, Jenkins told The Washington Post.\n\n“It’s not just an event you move past; there were significant discussions about the 2011 blackouts, and last summer’s blackouts in California,” Jenkins said. “These are the kinds of events that have significant policy and political ramifications.”\n\nTexas remains the only state to operate on an independent power grid, which is run by ERCOT. The state’s electricity market runs on an energy market, which Jenkins said works like Uber’s surge pricing: Rather than power companies being paid to make sure they have generators on call during times of high demand, they are paid only when they provide power.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIn Austin, Cody Miller, 36, had been without power since about 1:30 a.m. Monday. By 10 a.m., the temperature in his East Austin home was hovering near 50 degrees, with no clear information from the utility companies about when power might be restored.\n\nIt was the second time in a week he had lost power after enduring a 10-hour outage on Thursday. “There’s no real communication and 311 is pretty much down,” said Miller, who works in the telecom industry.\n\nIn parts of Dallas, residents lost electricity and water because of frozen pipes.\n\nBrandon Friedman, 42, who lives in northeastern Dallas, had been without power since about 2 a.m. and had no water despite leaving the faucets open slightly to drip.\n\nSpeaking to The Post from his car where he was charging his phone, Friedman described his driveway — blanketed in five inches of snow — and his regret at leaving one household item behind for the new residents when he moved from Virginia back to Dallas four years ago.\n\n“I left our snow shovel hanging up in the garage in Virginia because we weren’t going to need it in Texas,” Friedman said.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nBurst pipes led to widespread water disruptions, affecting over 15 million people in Texas.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Those poor people, all at similar ages to my grandchildren, they died anyway,” said Jung Si-hoon, a retiree and a church elder, who placed an old wooden cross at the makeshift altar.\n\n“What more should we say? We should pray for them and wish they rest in peace.”\n\nShops and cafés nearby were closed, and police cordoned off the site of the tragedy as they continued their investigations.\n\nSchools, kindergartens and companies around the country scrapped planned Halloween events. K-pop concerts and government briefings were also cancelled.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“The government will undertake a thorough investigation into what caused this accident and do its best to make necessary institutional changes so that such an accident is not repeated,” Prime Minister Han said as government officials met on the disaster.\n\n“Identification has been completed for all of the 154 deceased except one, and I believe it is time for follow-up measures such as funeral procedures to be carried out in earnest,” Han said. “We will do our best to provide necessary support by reflecting the opinions of the bereaved families as much as possible.”\n\nPresident Yoon Suk-yeol, who has declared a period of national mourning and designated Itaewon a disaster zone, visited a memorial altar outside the Seoul city hall with his wife on Monday to pay his respects to those who died. Former United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon was also among those expressing their condolences.\n\nThe crush of partygoers came as Itaewon, a symbol of freewheeling nightlife in the South Korean capital for decades, was beginning to recover from prolonged pandemic restrictions with new restaurants and shops opening.\n\nThe disaster is the worst in South Korea since the Sewol ferry sank in 2014, killing 304 people, most of them high school students.\n\nThe sinking of the Sewol and criticism of the official response sent shockwaves across South Korea, prompting widespread soul-searching over safety measures that are likely to be renewed in the wake of Saturday’s crush.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nWorld leaders, including Fumio Kishida, Joe Biden, and Xi Jinping, sent messages of condolence to President Yoon.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Why?\nContent: Myanmar’s military controls vast business interests in mining, telecommunications, textiles, hotels and even beer breweries and distribution. It faces no civilian oversight and can block changes to the country’s constitution. When it had to respond to international condemnation for its brutal repression of ethnic minorities, it trotted out members of its compliant civilian government to absorb the blame.\n\nWith such political and economic power, there seemed little for the military, known as the Tatmadaw, to complain about except for its lack of success at the ballot box, which it groundlessly blamed on voter fraud after elections in November.\n\nSo even close observers were surprised and puzzled by army leaders’ decision to stage a coup Monday, detaining prominent political figures such as Aung San Suu Kyi in early-morning raids and declaring one year of emergency rule. Now, the Tatmadaw is left with the sobering task of governing — a role it didn’t necessarily excel in during 49 years of chaotic military dictatorship that ended in 2011.\n\nIt faces a public health emergency in the COVID-19 pandemic, which has also triggered an economic crisis reminiscent of the one that precipitated a deadly popular uprising in 1988. Millions have been pushed into poverty over the last year, desperate enough for food to hunt rats and snakes in open sewers .\n\nThe nominal gains achieved by assuming total control could quickly be outweighed by sanctions imposed by the United States, the European Union and others that could disrupt Myanmar’s access to imports and, more important, the U.S. dollar.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Biden administration on Tuesday called for the release of those detained Monday and formally branded the Myanmar government overthrow a military coup, a harsh label that under U.S. law triggers a host of punishments, including the suspension of foreign aid.\n\nForeign companies that entered joint ventures with the Tatmadaw’s conglomerates are likely to come under growing pressure to reconsider their investments. Already, Japanese brewer Kirin is facing scrutiny over its presence in Myanmar, where it dominates the beer market in a partnership with the military-owned Myanmar Economic Holdings Ltd.\n\nAlthough no one outside the Tatmadaw knows for certain why it suddenly upended its comfortable status quo, some analysts say egos and political bickering inside Myanmar’s most powerful institution could be to blame.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“The military are not primarily motivated by financial concerns,” said Richard Horsey, a Myanmar-based analyst. “They never really have been. This is about pride, politics and personal ambition. More broadly, they have felt for some time that the civilian government was not giving them and their concerns due weight and respect, and was not following the constitutional rules.”\n\nThat includes Suu Kyi’s decision to circumvent a constitutional law barring her from the presidency by creating a higher position for herself in 2016, that of “state counselor.” And it probably included her refusal to entertain the military’s charges of election fraud by convening a special session of parliament over the matter.\n\n“This seems to be the only way to explain the military’s actions, which are so fundamentally against its own interests and the interests of the country,” Horsey said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough it was never out of the question, few in the country, also known as Burma, considered a coup likely given the Tatmadaw’s entrenched power behind the scenes. Suu Kyi and her party, the National League for Democracy, or NLD, also served a valuable purpose by giving Myanmar a veneer of democracy — enough to hold back calls for greater freedoms that inspired earlier generations to demonstrate against the military.\n\nIt wasn’t until late last month that the threat of a coup was taken more seriously after a military spokesman refused to rule it out if charges of election fraud went unaddressed.\n\nStill, analysts saw the move as posturing to pressure the NLD into making political concessions that might improve the military’s performance in general elections.\n\nDespite international criticism over her support of the military’s crackdownon the Muslim Rohingya minority, Suu Kyi is wildly popular within Myanmar and has twice led her party to landslide victories, first in 2015 and most recently Nov. 8.\n\nAlthough the Tatmadaw itself is guaranteed 25% of the seats in parliament, its civilian political proxy, the Union Solidarity and Development Party, has never been able to win enough seats necessary for the two to combine as a majority and to form a government.\n\nThat has frustrated aging members of the Tatmadaw seeking careers in government after retirement from the army.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“There’s no longer any place for these senior military people to go,” said Gerard McCarthy, a postdoctoral fellow at the National University of Singapore’s Asia Research Institute. “They’re forced to retire quite young, and they feel like they still have decades to serve. This is the fundamental tension in the political system. The USDP simply can’t win an election.”\n\nMyanmar’s new military ruler, the 64-year-old Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, fits that mold. He staved off forced retirement as head of the Tatmadaw by extending his term in 2016 by five years. Some speculate that the coup was designed to preserve the general’s power as he reaches retirement age later this year.\n\nMin Aung Hlaing also holds top positions at Myanmar Economic Holdings and Myanmar Economic Corp., the secretive military-owned duopoly that has cornered the most lucrative parts of the economy. The two conglomerates have been challenged to some degree by demands for more transparency and calls by the United Nations and Amnesty International for a boycott because of the Tatmadaw’s dismal human rights record.\n\nIn his first public remarks since the coup, Min Aung Hlaing told his Cabinet on Tuesday that the military takeover was “inevitable” and insisted it was legal.\n\nThe U.S. has already imposed sanctions on the general in 2019 for his role in the brutal crackdown on the Rohingya, hundreds of thousands of whom have been displaced and terrorized in military sweeps.\n\nA State Department official on Tuesday would not specify what sanctions or other judgments would be imposed, nor could the official say how much money in aid would be halted.\n\nThe official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to brief reporters, insisted suspension of aid would not hurt the Rohingya Muslim minority who receive U.S. assistance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere’s no guarantee that Min Aung Hlaing can keep the public pacified during emergency rule. Supporters of Suu Kyi and the NLD could take to the streets, resulting in bloodshed. Fractures could emerge within the Tatmadaw. And any changes to the electoral system designed to boost the military-backed party’s chances could end up energizing the opposition and de-legitimizing future elections.\n\nThe cascade of potentially bad outcomes seems like a heavy price to pay for so little political gain, said Kim Jolliffe, an analyst based in Bangkok, Thailand, who specializes in Myanmar’s civil-military relations.\n\nNewsletter Breaking News Get breaking news, investigations, analysis and more signature journalism from the Los Angeles Times in your inbox.

Nothing was going to change. Aung San Suu Kyi defended them at [The Hague]. She was a block on the potential mass unrest that kept the Tatmadaw awake at night under military rule.”\n\nThat safeguard is now gone, leaving Myanmar’s army rulers exposed, its international standing in tatters and its people bracing for what the next 12 months or more will bring.\n\nThant Myint-U, a closely followed Burmese historian and author, said in a tweet it was important to not lose sight of the toll the putsch would have on Myanmar’s increasingly desperate population.\n\n“While everyone’s thinking about Myanmar politics please also think about Myanmar’s poor.

It says the president “gravely and extensively violated the constitution and the law” and accuses him of imposing martial law “with the unconstitutional and illegal intent to evade imminent investigations … into alleged illegal acts involving himself and his family”.\n\nIn an early Thursday morning session, lawmakers presented the impeachment motion to parliament.\n\n“This is an unforgivable crime – one that cannot, should not, and will not be pardoned,” MP Kim Seung-won said.\n\nYoon’s governing People Power Party said it would oppose the motion but the party has been divided over the crisis. The opposition Democratic Party, which has a majority in parliament, needs at least eight governing party lawmakers to back the bill in order for it to pass.\n\nUnder South Korea’s constitution, impeachment requires a two-thirds majority in the 300-member National Assembly. The Democratic Party currently holds 170 seats in parliament. A vote could take place as soon as Friday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe leader of the governing party on Wednesday slammed the incident and called for those involved to be held accountable.\n\n“The president must directly and thoroughly explain this tragic situation,” Han Dong-hoon told reporters in a televised broadcast.\n\nIf the National Assembly does agree to impeach, Yoon will be temporarily stripped of his presidential authority while the constitutional court considers his fate.\n\nSeveral senior officials have offered their resignations in the wake of the bungled events, including Presidential Chief of Staff Chung Jin-suk, National Security Adviser Shin Won-sik, and Presidential Chief of Staff for Policy Sung Tae-yoon.\n\nPrime Minister Han Duck-soo pledged to continue serving the people “until the last moment” and asked the cabinet to fulfil its responsibility together with the public officials of all ministries.\n\nThe Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, one of the country’s largest labour organisations, had called for a strike until the president’s resignation.\n\nOverreach\n\nYoon announced he would lift the martial law order hours after the initial declaration on Tuesday.\n\nHe had said he was forced to issue the order “to defend the free Republic of Korea from the threats of North Korean communist forces” and accused the political opposition of “paralysing” his government and “undermining” the constitutional order.\n\nLawmakers then tussled with soldiers in order to enter parliament where they passed a legally binding motion forcing Yoon to reverse the order.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Democratic Party leader, Park Chan-dae, warned soon after the martial law order ended that Yoon “cannot avoid the charge of treason”.\n\nGreg Scarlatoiu, the president and CEO of the Committee for Human Rights in North Korea, told Al Jazeera that Article 77 of the South Korean Constitution stipulates that martial law may be declared when the country basically faces an existential threat.\n\n“It seems that this is a fairly frivolous exercise in declaring martial law,” he said.\n\nScarlatoiu noted that there may be some basis to Yoon’s assertion of a threat to national security. The Democratic Party, which holds the majority in parliament, has made it impossible for the executive branch to operate.\n\nYet, the fact that 190 members of parliament rejected martial law was a sign the president had overreached.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nPolice, parliament, prosecutors, and the anti-corruption body launched separate investigations into Yoon on treason allegations.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA. Hundreds of soldiers stormed the National Assembly.\nB. Baek Jae Gil performed his protest anthem for thousands outside the National Assembly in Seoul.\nC.

Groups in China and South Korea have also raised concern, making it a political and diplomatic issue.\n\nBut the Japanese government and TEPCO say the water must be released to make room for the plant's decommissioning and to prevent accidental leaks. They say the treatment and dilution will make the wastewater safer than international standards and its environmental impact will be negligibly small. But some scientists say long-term impact of the low-dose radioactivity that remains in the water needs attention.\n\nThe water release begins more than 12 years after the March 2011 nuclear meltdowns, caused by a massive earthquake and tsunami. It marks a milestone for the plant's battle with an ever-growing radioactive water stockpile that TEPCO and the government say have hampered the daunting task of removing the fatally toxic melted debris from the reactors.\n\nThe pump activated Thursday afternoon would send the first batch of the diluted, treated water from a mixing pool to a secondary pool, where the water is then discharged into the ocean through an undersea tunnel. The water is collected and partly recycled as cooling water after treatment, with the rest stored in around 1,000 tanks, which are already filled to 98% of their 1.37-million-ton capacity.\n\nThose tanks, which cover much of the plant complex, must be freed up to build the new facilities needed for the decommissioning process, officials said.\n\nPrime Minister Fumio Kishida said it is indispensable and and cannot be postponed. He noted an experimental removal of a small amount of the melted debris from the No. 2 reactor is set for later this year using a remote-controlled giant robotic arm.\n\nTEPCO executive Junichi Matsumoto said Thursday's release was to begin with the least radioactive water to ensure safety.\n\nFinal preparation for the release began Tuesday, when just one ton of treated water was sent from a tank for dilution with 1,200 tons of seawater, and the mixture was kept in the primary pool for two days for final sampling to ensure safety, Matsumoto said. A batch of 460 tons was to be sent to the mixing pool Thursday for the actual discharge.\n\nBut Fukushima's fisheries, tourism and economy — which are still recovering from the disaster — worry the release could be the beginning of a new hardship.\n\nFukushima's current fish catch is only about one-fifth its pre-disaster level, in part due to a decline in the fishing population. China has tightened radiation testing on Japanese products from Fukushima and nine other prefectures, halting exports at customs for weeks, Fisheries Agency officials said.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nA TEPCO staff member activated a seawater pump and an operator confirmed the release.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA. A huge earthquake and tsunami in 2011 caused a meltdown at the Fukushima plant.\nB. South Korea banned seafood imports from the Fukushima area.\nC. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) issued a report in July 2023 confirming Fukushima’s release will have a negligible radiological effect.\nD.

The model has rapidly gained popularity, igniting discussions across social media platforms and becoming a trending topic. Users have shared various memes and opinions, praising its capabilities and disruptive impact on the AI industry.\n\nDeepSeek-R1’s associated application has surged in downloads, becoming the most downloaded free AI app on the US Apple App Store. It achieved the top spot in India across all app categories, surpassing major players such as ChatGPT and Google Gemini. Sensor Tower data highlights that the app climbed from rank 102 on January 25 to rank 1 by January 27, maintaining its position the following day.\n\nThe app has also performed exceptionally well in the productivity app category, leaping from rank 132 on January 18 to the top position by January 27, displacing ChatGPT. On Android’s Play Store, DeepSeek-R1 has shown significant improvement, climbing from rank 447 on January 16 to rank 15 by January 28, trailing Google Gemini by just one position.\n\nPowered by a reasoning-based AI model with 670 billion parameters, DeepSeek-R1 stands as the largest open-source language model to date. Experts have drawn comparisons between its performance and OpenAI’s GPT-4, particularly in tasks related to mathematics, coding, and reasoning. What sets DeepSeek apart is its cost-effective development process—while OpenAI reportedly spent over $100 million on GPT-4, DeepSeek achieved similar capabilities for just $6 million by leveraging less advanced hardware combined with Nvidia A100 chips.\n\nBeyond the United States, the app has gained immense popularity worldwide. It has become the most downloaded application in countries such as the UK, Australia, Singapore, and Canada. However, its expansion across Europe has been relatively slower, indicating potential challenges in broader global adoption.\n\nAlso Read :- Nakul Jain Steps Down as Paytm Payments Services CEO\n\nChina’s growing expertise in artificial intelligence is evident in DeepSeek’s success. The company’s rise aligns with Beijing’s strategic focus on transitioning from traditional manufacturing to cutting-edge technologies. Despite international restrictions on advanced chip exports to China, DeepSeek has demonstrated an ability to innovate using available resources, raising questions about the effectiveness of such trade limitations.\n\nLike other AI models developed in China, DeepSeek incorporates safeguards to steer clear of politically sensitive subjects. When prompted about the 1989 Tiananmen Square incident, for instance, the app responded with a disclaimer—reflecting the constraints imposed by government regulations. While this censorship may hinder its acceptance in certain international markets, the model maintains high accuracy in other domains by integrating reliable data sources.\n\nThe rapid ascent of DeepSeek signals a notable shift in the AI industry. By combining affordability, scalability, and advanced reasoning capabilities, the company has emerged as a strong competitor to major industry players. Its rise not only disrupts the global AI landscape but also underscores the increasing influence of Chinese tech startups on the international stage.\n\nBe a part of Elets Collaborative Initiatives.

Our 20 years of sacrifice worked.\"\n\nIn Washington, Gen. Frank McKenzie, head of U.S. Central Command, announced the completion of America's longest war and the evacuation effort, saying the last planes took off from Kabul airport at 3:29 p.m. EDT — one minute before midnight Monday in Kabul.\n\n\"We did not get everybody out that we wanted to get out,\" he said.\n\nWith its last troops gone, the U.S. ended its 20-year war with the Taliban back in power. Many Afghans remain fearful of their rule or of further instability, and there have been sporadic reports of killings and other abuses in areas under Taliban control despite the group's pledges to restore peace and security.\n\n\"American soldiers left the Kabul airport, and our nation got its full independence,\" Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said early Tuesday.\n\nThe U.S. and its allies invaded Afghanistan shortly after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attack on the United States, which al-Qaida orchestrated while sheltering under Taliban rule. The invasion drove the Taliban from power in a matter of weeks and scattered Osama bin Laden and other top al-Qaida leaders.\n\nThe U.S. and its allies launched an ambitious effort to rebuild Afghanistan after decades of war, investing billions of dollars in a Western-style government and security forces. Women, who had been largely confined to their homes under the Taliban's hard-line rule, benefited from access to education and came to assume prominent roles in public life.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBut the Taliban never went away.\n\nIn the coming years, as the U.S. focused on another troubled war in Iraq and the Afghan government became mired in corruption, the Taliban regrouped in the countryside and in neighboring Pakistan. In recent years, they seized large parts of rural Afghanistan and carried out near-daily assaults on Afghan security forces.\n\nEager to end the war, the Trump administration signed a peace deal with the Taliban in February 2020 that paved the way for the withdrawal. President Joe Biden extended the deadline from May to August and continued with the pullout despite the Taliban's rapid blitz across the country earlier this month.\n\nNow the Taliban control all of Afghanistan except for the mountainous Panjshir province, where a few thousand local fighters and remnants of Afghanistan's collapsed security forces have pledged to resist them. The Taliban say they are seeking a peaceful resolution there.\n\nThey face much graver challenges now that they govern one of the poorest and most war-ravaged nations on Earth.\n\nIn recent days Afghans have lined up outside banks as an economic crisis that predates the Taliban takeover worsens. A string of attacks by the Islamic State extremist group's local affiliate, including a barrage of rockets fired at the airport Monday, shows the security challenges the Taliban face.\n\nOn Thursday, an Islamic State suicide attack at an airport gate killed at least 169 Afghans and 13 U.S. service members. The extremist group is far more radical than the Taliban, and the two groups have fought each other before. The Taliban say they will prevent Afghanistan from again being used as a base for terror attacks, a pledge that will likely be tested soon.\n\nMcKenzie said the Taliban were \"significantly helpful\" in enabling the airlift but will have difficulty securing Kabul in the coming days, not least because of the threat they face from IS. He said the Taliban had freed IS fighters from prisons, swelling their ranks to an estimated 2,000.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"Now they are going to be able to reap what they sowed,\" the American general said.\n\nMany Afghans fear the Taliban themselves, who governed the country under a harsh interpretation of Islamic law from 1996 until 2001. In those years they banned television and music, barred women from attending school or working outside the home, and carried out public executions.\n\nThe Taliban have sought to project a more moderate image since the takeover. They say women will be able to attend school and work, and have renounced any revenge attacks on Afghans who worked with the former government, the U.S. or its allies.\n\nMany Afghans are deeply skeptical of such promises, and fear of the Taliban's rule drove tens of thousands to flee the country over the past two weeks. Thousands more waited in vain outside the airport, many of them standing for hours in a sewage canal.\n\nThe Kabul international airport had been one of the few ways out. At one point people flooded onto the tarmac and seven fell to their deaths after clinging to a plane that was taking off. Another seven died in a stampede of people outside an airport gate.\n\nThe Taliban have said they will allow normal travel, but it is unclear how they will run the airport and which commercial carriers will begin flying in, given security concerns.\n\nQatar, a close U.S. ally that has long hosted a Taliban political office, has been taking part in negotiations about operations at the airport with Afghan and international parties, mainly the U.S. and Turkey. Qatari Assistant Foreign Minister Lolwa al-Khater said its main priority is restoring regular operations while maintaining security at the airport.\n\nThe last known U.S. military operation in Afghanistan came Sunday, when American officials said a drone strike blew up a vehicle carrying IS suicide bombers who were planning to attack the airport.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBut like so much about the Afghanistan war, it may not have gone as planned.\n\nRelatives of those killed in Sunday's strike said it killed civilians who had nothing to do with the extremist group.\n\nNajibullah Ismailzada said his brother-in-law, Zemarai Ahmadi, had just arrived home from his job working with a Korean charity. As he drove into the garage, his children came out to greet him, and that is when the missile struck.\n\n\"We lost 10 members of our family,\" Ismailzada said, including six children raging in age from 2 to 8. He said another relative, Naser Nejrabi, who was a former soldier in the Afghan army and a former interpreter for the U.S. military, also was killed, along with two teenagers.\n\nU.S. officials have acknowledged the reports of civilian casualties without confirming them.\n\nHours before the withdrawal was complete, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the U.S. military takes steps to avoid civilian casualties when carrying out targeted strikes.\n\n\"Of course, the loss of life from anywhere is horrible, and it impacts families no matter where they're living, in the United States or around the world,\" she said.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nThe last U.S. military planes departed Afghanistan around midnight Monday (Kabul time), completing the withdrawal.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

In recent years, they seized large parts of rural Afghanistan and carried out near-daily assaults on Afghan security forces.\n\nEager to end the war, the Trump administration signed a peace deal with the Taliban in February 2020 that paved the way for the withdrawal. President Joe Biden extended the deadline from May to August and continued with the pullout despite the Taliban's rapid blitz across the country earlier this month.\n\nNow the Taliban control all of Afghanistan except for the mountainous Panjshir province, where a few thousand local fighters and remnants of Afghanistan's collapsed security forces have pledged to resist them. The Taliban say they are seeking a peaceful resolution there.\n\nThey face much graver challenges now that they govern one of the poorest and most war-ravaged nations on Earth.\n\nIn recent days Afghans have lined up outside banks as an economic crisis that predates the Taliban takeover worsens. A string of attacks by the Islamic State extremist group's local affiliate, including a barrage of rockets fired at the airport Monday, shows the security challenges the Taliban face.\n\nOn Thursday, an Islamic State suicide attack at an airport gate killed at least 169 Afghans and 13 U.S. service members. The extremist group is far more radical than the Taliban, and the two groups have fought each other before. The Taliban say they will prevent Afghanistan from again being used as a base for terror attacks, a pledge that will likely be tested soon.\n\nMcKenzie said the Taliban were \"significantly helpful\" in enabling the airlift but will have difficulty securing Kabul in the coming days, not least because of the threat they face from IS. He said the Taliban had freed IS fighters from prisons, swelling their ranks to an estimated 2,000.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"Now they are going to be able to reap what they sowed,\" the American general said.\n\nMany Afghans fear the Taliban themselves, who governed the country under a harsh interpretation of Islamic law from 1996 until 2001. In those years they banned television and music, barred women from attending school or working outside the home, and carried out public executions.\n\nThe Taliban have sought to project a more moderate image since the takeover. They say women will be able to attend school and work, and have renounced any revenge attacks on Afghans who worked with the former government, the U.S. or its allies.\n\nMany Afghans are deeply skeptical of such promises, and fear of the Taliban's rule drove tens of thousands to flee the country over the past two weeks. Thousands more waited in vain outside the airport, many of them standing for hours in a sewage canal.\n\nThe Kabul international airport had been one of the few ways out. At one point people flooded onto the tarmac and seven fell to their deaths after clinging to a plane that was taking off. Another seven died in a stampede of people outside an airport gate.\n\nThe Taliban have said they will allow normal travel, but it is unclear how they will run the airport and which commercial carriers will begin flying in, given security concerns.\n\nQatar, a close U.S. ally that has long hosted a Taliban political office, has been taking part in negotiations about operations at the airport with Afghan and international parties, mainly the U.S. and Turkey. Qatari Assistant Foreign Minister Lolwa al-Khater said its main priority is restoring regular operations while maintaining security at the airport.\n\nThe last known U.S. military operation in Afghanistan came Sunday, when American officials said a drone strike blew up a vehicle carrying IS suicide bombers who were planning to attack the airport.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBut like so much about the Afghanistan war, it may not have gone as planned.\n\nRelatives of those killed in Sunday's strike said it killed civilians who had nothing to do with the extremist group.\n\nNajibullah Ismailzada said his brother-in-law, Zemarai Ahmadi, had just arrived home from his job working with a Korean charity. As he drove into the garage, his children came out to greet him, and that is when the missile struck.\n\n\"We lost 10 members of our family,\" Ismailzada said, including six children raging in age from 2 to 8. He said another relative, Naser Nejrabi, who was a former soldier in the Afghan army and a former interpreter for the U.S. military, also was killed, along with two teenagers.\n\nU.S. officials have acknowledged the reports of civilian casualties without confirming them.\n\nHours before the withdrawal was complete, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the U.S. military takes steps to avoid civilian casualties when carrying out targeted strikes.\n\n\"Of course, the loss of life from anywhere is horrible, and it impacts families no matter where they're living, in the United States or around the world,\" she said.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nU.S. troops left Bagram Airfield.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Groups in China and South Korea have also raised concern, making it a political and diplomatic issue.\n\nBut the Japanese government and TEPCO say the water must be released to make room for the plant's decommissioning and to prevent accidental leaks. They say the treatment and dilution will make the wastewater safer than international standards and its environmental impact will be negligibly small. But some scientists say long-term impact of the low-dose radioactivity that remains in the water needs attention.\n\nThe water release begins more than 12 years after the March 2011 nuclear meltdowns, caused by a massive earthquake and tsunami. It marks a milestone for the plant's battle with an ever-growing radioactive water stockpile that TEPCO and the government say have hampered the daunting task of removing the fatally toxic melted debris from the reactors.\n\nThe pump activated Thursday afternoon would send the first batch of the diluted, treated water from a mixing pool to a secondary pool, where the water is then discharged into the ocean through an undersea tunnel. The water is collected and partly recycled as cooling water after treatment, with the rest stored in around 1,000 tanks, which are already filled to 98% of their 1.37-million-ton capacity.\n\nThose tanks, which cover much of the plant complex, must be freed up to build the new facilities needed for the decommissioning process, officials said.\n\nPrime Minister Fumio Kishida said it is indispensable and and cannot be postponed. He noted an experimental removal of a small amount of the melted debris from the No. 2 reactor is set for later this year using a remote-controlled giant robotic arm.\n\nTEPCO executive Junichi Matsumoto said Thursday's release was to begin with the least radioactive water to ensure safety.\n\nFinal preparation for the release began Tuesday, when just one ton of treated water was sent from a tank for dilution with 1,200 tons of seawater, and the mixture was kept in the primary pool for two days for final sampling to ensure safety, Matsumoto said. A batch of 460 tons was to be sent to the mixing pool Thursday for the actual discharge.\n\nBut Fukushima's fisheries, tourism and economy — which are still recovering from the disaster — worry the release could be the beginning of a new hardship.\n\nFukushima's current fish catch is only about one-fifth its pre-disaster level, in part due to a decline in the fishing population. China has tightened radiation testing on Japanese products from Fukushima and nine other prefectures, halting exports at customs for weeks, Fisheries Agency officials said.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nA TEPCO staff member activated a seawater pump and an operator confirmed the release.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert at causal reasoning."}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n### CONTEXT\n[Doc 1]\nTitle: What caused Myanmar and Thailand earthquake and how big was it?\nContent: An earthquake with a 7.7 magnitude has hit central Myanmar, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) has said, with Thailand’s capital, Bangkok, among other areas affected. We take a look at the origins of the event and the scale of the disaster.\n\nWhat happened? According to the USGS, a 7.7 magnitude earthquake was recorded in Mandalay, Myanmar at 6.21am GMT. The quake is thought to have been shallow, arising at a depth of just 10km (6 miles), but the damage is expected to be enormous, with multiple buildings collapsed or damaged and reports of roads buckled and broken. The death toll is climbing, with fatalities reported in both Myanmar and Thailand. Bill McGuire, emeritus professor of geophysical and climate hazards at University College London, said: “It is highly likely that build quality will generally not be high enough to survive this level of shaking, and casualty numbers will almost certainly climb significantly as more becomes known of the scale of the disaster.”\n\nWhat caused the earthquake? Earthquakes arise when huge slabs of rock that make up the Earth’s crust, known as tectonic plates, move against each other. According to USGS, the Myanmar quake occurred as the result of “strike slip faulting” between the India and Eurasia plates – meaning that these two tectonic plates rubbed sideways against each other. Map showing areas affected by earthquake “The quake happened on the Sagaing fault, which marks the tectonic plate boundary between the Indian plate to the west and the Eurasian plate to the east. The Indian plate is moving north along the fault compared to the Eurasian plate,” said McGuire. The USGS says the region has experience several similar large strike slip earthquakes in the past, with six occurring within about 250km of the current earthquake since 1900 that were magnitude 7 or greater.\n\nWhat do these magnitude figures mean? While many people have heard of the Richter scale to measure the size of an earthquake, the current standard is the moment magnitude scale. “The Richter scale is an old scale developed for California. It is only good for smaller quakes, and is not very good at differentiating the sizes of bigger shocks,” said McGuire. As the USGS website notes, the moment magnitude calculation is based on the strength of the rock where the slip occurred, the area of the fault that slipped, and the distance the fault moved. “Thus, stronger rock material, or a larger area, or more movement in an earthquake, will all contribute to produce a larger magnitude,” it adds. However, like the Richter scale, the moment magnitude scale is logarithmic, meaning that as the magnitude increases by one unit, the degree of ground shaking involved increases 10-fold. “This is a major quake by any standard, and its impact is made far worse by the fact that it was very shallow – only about 10km down. If it had been 100km deep, the impact would have been much smaller, so depth as well as size is critical,” said McGuire. But, he added, measurements do vary dependent on the locations of the seismic arrays used. According to the China Earthquake Networks Center the Myanmar earthquake reached 7.9 magnitude, with tremors felt in China’s south-west Yunnan province.\n\nWill there be further quakes? “There has already been one large aftershock, and others can be expected in coming hours to days,” said McGuire. “These can bring down already weakened buildings and make the work of rescuers even more challenging.”\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nAuthorities in Myanmar and Thailand declared a state of emergency.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Did you know, for example, ChatGPT needs to do an internet search to look up events later than June 2024?\n\nSome of the most surprising information about AI chatbots can help us understand how they work, what they can and can't do, and so how to use them in a better way.\n\nWith that in mind, here are five things you ought to know about these breakthrough machines.\n\nRelated: Does Using Artificial Intelligence Ruin Your Actual Intelligence? Scientists Investigated\n\n1. They are trained by human feedback\n\nAI chatbots are trained in multiple stages, beginning with something called pre-training, where models are trained to predict the next word in massive text datasets. This allows them to develop a general understanding of language, facts and reasoning.\n\nIf asked: \"How do I make a homemade explosive?\" in the pre-training phase, a model might have given a detailed instruction. To make them useful and safe for conversation, human \"annotators\" help guide the models toward safer and more helpful responses, a process called alignment.\n\nAfter alignment, an AI chatbot might answer something like: \"I'm sorry, but I can't provide that information. If you have safety concerns or need help with legal chemistry experiments, I recommend referring to certified educational sources.\"\n\nWithout alignment, AI chatbots would be unpredictable, potentially spreading misinformation or harmful content. This highlights the crucial role of human intervention in shaping AI behavior.\n\nOpenAI, the company which developed ChatGPT, has not disclosed how many employees have trained ChatGPT for how many hours. But it is clear that AI chatbots, like ChatGPT, need a moral compass so that it does not spread harmful information. Human annotators rank responses to ensure neutrality and ethical alignment.\n\nSimilarly, if an AI chatbot was asked: \"What are the best and worst nationalities?\"\n\nHuman annotators would rank a response like this the highest: \"Every nationality has its own rich culture, history, and contributions to the world. There is no 'best' or 'worst' nationality – each one is valuable in its own way.\"\n\n2. They don't learn through words – but with the help of tokens\n\nHumans naturally learn language through words, whereas AI chatbots rely on smaller units called tokens. These units can be words, subwords or obscure series of characters.\n\nWhile tokenization generally follows logical patterns, it can sometimes produce unexpected splits, revealing both the strengths and quirks of how AI chatbots interpret language. Modern AI chatbots' vocabularies typically consist of 50,000 to 100,000 tokens.\n\nThe sentence \"The price is $9.99.\" is tokenized by ChatGPT as \"The\", \" price\", \"is\", \"$\" \" 9″, \".\", \"99\", whereas \"ChatGPT is marvellous\" is tokenized less intuitively: \"chat\", \"G\", \"PT\", \" is\", \"mar\", \"vellous\".\n\n3. Their knowledge is outdated every passing day\n\nAI chatbots do not continuously update themselves; hence, they may struggle with recent events, new terminology or broadly anything after their knowledge cutoff. A knowledge cut-off refers to the last point in time when an AI chatbot's training data was updated, meaning it lacks awareness of events, trends or discoveries beyond that date.\n\nThe current version of ChatGPT has its cutoff on June 2024. If asked who is the currently president of the United States, ChatGPT would need to perform a web search using the search engine Bing, \"read\" the results, and return an answer.\n\nBing results are filtered by relevance and reliability of the source. Likewise, other AI chatbots uses web search to return up-to-date answers.\n\nUpdating AI chatbots is a costly and fragile process. How to efficiently update their knowledge is still an open scientific problem. ChatGPT's knowledge is believed to be updated as Open AI introduces new ChatGPT versions.\n\n4. They hallucinate really easily\n\nAI chatbots sometimes \"hallucinate\", generating false or nonsensical claims with confidence because they predict text based on patterns rather than verifying facts. These errors stem from the way they work: they optimize for coherence over accuracy, rely on imperfect training data and lack real world understanding.\n\nWhile improvements such as fact-checking tools (for example, like ChatGPT's Bing search tool integration for real-time fact-checking) or prompts (for example, explicitly telling ChatGPT to \"cite peer-reviewed sources\" or \"say I don ́t know if you are not sure\") reduce hallucinations, they can't fully eliminate them.\n\nFor example, when asked what the main findings are of a particular research paper, ChatGPT gives a long, detailed and good-looking answer.\n\nIt also included screenshots and even a link, but from the wrong academic papers. So users should treat AI-generated information as a starting point, not an unquestionable truth.\n\n5. They use calculators to do maths\n\nA recently popularized feature of AI chatbots is called reasoning. Reasoning refers to the process of using logically connected intermediate steps to solve complex problems. This is also known as \"chain of thought\" reasoning.\n\nInstead of jumping directly to an answer, chain of thought enables AI chatbots to think step by step. For example, when asked \"what is 56,345 minus 7,865 times 350,468\", ChatGPT gives the right answer. It \"understands\" that the multiplication needs to occur before the subtraction.\n\nTo solve the intermediate steps, ChatGPT uses its built-in calculator that enables precise arithmetic. This hybrid approach of combining internal reasoning with the calculator helps improve reliability in complex tasks.\n\nÇağatay Yıldız, Postdoctoral Researcher, Cluster of Excellence \" Machine Learning\", University of Tübingen\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

Instead, he said, the company plans to focus on what Zuckerberg described as the next wave of computing: a virtual universe where people will roam freely as avatars, attending virtual business meetings, shopping in virtual stores and socializing at virtual get-togethers.\n\n“From now on, we’re going to be the metaverse first. Not Facebook first,” Zuckerberg said at Connect, the company’s annual event focused on virtual and augmented reality. “Facebook is one of the most-used products in the world. But increasingly, it doesn’t encompass everything that we do. Right now, our brand is so tightly linked to one product that it can’t possibly represent everything we are doing.”\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg revealed the change at the company's annual Connect event on Oct. 28. Facebook's social media platform will keep its current name. (Video: Facebook)\n\nThe move comes as Facebook is mired in controversy over allegations that it has privately and meticulously tracked real-world harms exacerbated by its platforms, ignored warnings from its employees about the risks of their design decisions and exposed vulnerable communities around the world to a cocktail of dangerous content. After a whistleblower this month turned over tens of thousands of internal company documents to Congress and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, lawmakers and critics have called for urgent action to rein in the tech giant.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe revelations by whistleblower Frances Haugen represent arguably the most profound challenge yet to Zuckerberg and his company, which ranks as the largest social media platform in the world. Critics swiftly criticized the move, comparing it to the crisis strategy employed by tobacco company Phillip Morris when it became clear that the company had long known that cigarettes damage human health.\n\n“Don’t forget that when Phillip Morris changed [its] name to Altria it was still selling cigarettes that caused cancer,” tweeted Democratic lawyer Marc Elias.\n\nZuckerberg said the rebrand would heed the “lessons” of the past, noting in a blog post that privacy and safety would be built into the new generation of products “from Day One” — a clear nod to Facebook’s record of eroding trust. In his keynote address, he also nodded to Facebook’s problems, saying, “The last few years have been humbling for me and my company in a lot of ways.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Facebook’s trust deficit is real. The crisis brought on by the Facebook Papers, which were provided to Congress and the Securities and Exchange Commission in response to a whistleblower lawsuit, follows other scandals in recent years, such as Russian disinformation surrounding the 2016 presidential election and the Cambridge Analytica crisis that highlighted the improper sharing of personal data.\n\nThe current crisis is more existential for the company, because the harm comes from within rather than from an outsider abusing the service. The Facebook Papers also touch every aspect of the service, exposing fundamental flaws in the architecture of its algorithms, the design of the platform, and its policies, while the harms exposed around mental health and polarization hit close to home for many Americans.\n\nThe Facebook Papers were obtained by a consortium of news organizations, including The Washington Post. Facebook has called them a “coordinated effort to selectively use leaked documents to paint a false picture of our company.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the major allegations of the Facebook Papers is that the company built and deployed social media technology without having a grasp of its harmful effects. Critics fear the same problems would plague the metaverse — only the stakes could be higher, as Zuckerberg pitched that people would essentially live part of their lives in his virtual world.\n\nHe sought to offset potential criticism by saying in his presentation that the next generation of Internet services would be built with greater “humility and openness,” and take the “lessons” of the past into account. But critics and some former insiders questioned that commitment.\n\n“I was thinking during the keynote, who will be the cops in the metaverse?” said Katie Harbath, founder and CEO of consultancy Anchor Change and former Facebook public policy director. “The first few years may seem great because not that many people are on the service, but the more that come on, the more bad actors. And then the company plays catch-up.”\n\nHarbath noted that roughly every five years, the company has announced a big directional change amid a bad press cycle. In 2012, the company pivoted to mobile while getting attacked for a poor performance during its public offering. In 2017, it announced a shift to focus on communities and groups — bringing the world together — after the controversies over Russian disinformation during the previous year’s presidential election.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor the time being, Facebook’s name change seems aspirational. A company that Zuckerberg launched from a college dorm room 17 years ago has become a conglomerate encompassing WhatsApp, Instagram, Messenger and a nascent payments and hardware business, leading some experts and insiders to say that the company was long overdue for a name change.\n\nBut virtually all of Facebook’s revenue — $29 billion in the third quarter — comes from online advertising produced by the core blue Facebook app, meaning that any transition to virtual reality focused on the sale of hardware would take enormous investment and many years.\n\n“While the name change indicates a larger vision, that transformation is not yet a reality and will be a years-long investment,” eMarketer analyst Audrey Schomer said in an email.\n\nZuckerberg and Facebook have acknowledged that. Zuckerberg said in his keynote that the process to become a metaverse company would take a “decade” and that his goal was for it to “reach a billion people” over that time. On Monday, the company said its investments in the metaverse — which include a commitment to hiring 10,000 new people in hardware jobs — will shave $10 billion off its 2021 profits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nZuckerberg’s keynote was filled with a dizzying array of scenes that showcased the company’s vision for the metaverse. It included Zuckerberg doing his favorite water sport, hydrofoiling, with friends in a virtual environment, and then jumping into work meetings from a virtual home office, boxing with virtual avatars and working out on a virtual lily pad.\n\nIn a letter on the company’s website posted shortly after the keynote, Zuckerberg said that the future would be “an embodied internet where you’re in the experience, not just looking at it. We call this the metaverse, and it will touch every product we build.”\n\nZuckerberg began talking about how the company would transition to a new identity this summer. He subsequently announced a smart-glasses partnership with Ray-Ban and a plan to use its virtual reality headsets for work-related videoconferencing. He promoted a longtime friend who heads the hardware division, Andrew Bosworth, to become the company’s new chief technology officer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe political dimension of the rebrand also began months before Haugen emerged with the Facebook Papers. Facebook executives spent parts of the summer introducing the metaverse idea to experts in Washington think tanks and planning outreach to federal agencies that might regulate its hardware, The Post previously reported. Zuckerberg has told colleagues that he no longer wants to be the face of the company’s headaches in Washington and elsewhere.\n\nThe term “metaverse” comes from science fiction and has been popularized by venture capitalists in recent years as a way to talk about interconnected services.\n\nFacebook also isn’t the first Silicon Valley company to rebrand itself. Google changed its parent company’s name to Alphabet in 2015 in an attempt to unify a corporate behemoth that encompassed not only search-and-display advertising but also driverless cars and a life-sciences division. Snapchat changed its name to Snap Inc. in an attempt to rebrand itself as a camera company.\n\nZuckerberg said that the name “meta” was inspired by his love of the classics, and that it comes from the Greek word “beyond.”\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nFacebook changed its corporate name to Meta on October 28 at the company's annual Connect event.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said Tuesday that the release of more than 1 million metric tons of wastewater — equivalent to more than 500 Olympic-size swimming pools — will take place in a safe manner.\n\n“We expect the discharge to begin on Aug. 24 if weather and sea conditions do not hinder it,” Kishida said after a cabinet meeting in Tokyo, asking the plant’s operator, Tokyo Electric Power Co., to prepare for the release.\n\nJapan said it will send treated radioactive water from Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant into the Pacific Ocean on Aug. 24, despite local and global opposition. (Video: Naomi Schanen/The Washington Post)\n\nAfter a two-year review, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) concluded last month that Japan’s plan meets international safety standards and would have “negligible” radiological impact on people and the environment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“The government is committed to taking full responsibility until the disposal of the treated water is completed, even if it takes decades to complete,” Kishida said Tuesday.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe water, filtered to remove radioactive elements and highly diluted to lower the concentration of tritium, will be released into the Pacific Ocean in a process expected to take more than 30 years. The concentration of tritium, a radioactive material that is extremely difficult to separate from water, will drop to background ocean levels after the dilution, Japanese authorities say.\n\nFor years, the contaminated water has been stored in large metal tanks near the plant, the site of one of the worst nuclear disasters in history. But Japan is running out of space to build more tanks to accommodate the contaminated groundwater and rainwater that are still exiting the site.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStarting Thursday, the treated water will be discharged at a maximum rate of 132,000 gallons a day through an underwater tunnel off the coast of Japan. External observers, including the IAEA, will monitor the release process.\n\nThe IAEA said Tuesday that it will maintain “its impartial, independent, and objective safety review during the discharge phase.” The agency, which has an office at the plant, said it will continue to assess the relevant activities and publish independent data.\n\nDespite such assurances, environmental groups have questioned the safety of releasing the contaminated water and urged Tokyo to drop the plan.\n\n“Instead of engaging in an honest debate about this reality, the Japanese government has opted for a false solution — decades of deliberate radioactive pollution of the marine environment — during a time when the world’s oceans are already facing immense stress and pressures,” said Shaun Burnie, senior nuclear specialist at Greenpeace East Asia.\n\nThe pending discharge has been highly politicized by neighboring countries. China has been adamantly opposed to the release, which comes at a time of heightened geopolitical tensions between Tokyo and Beijing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“China has pointed out on many occasions that ocean discharge is not the safest or most prudent option to dispose of the nuclear-contaminated water. Japan simply chose it to lower economic costs,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said Monday. “This will pose unnecessary risks to neighboring countries and the rest of the world,” he said, urging Japan to call off the plan.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe plan has also ignited debates in South Korea, which has banned seafood imports from the Fukushima area, even though South Korea’s own assessment of the water-release plan also found it meets international standards.\n\nA senior South Korean government official said Tuesday that Seoul does not necessarily support Japan’s wastewater plan but sees “no scientific or technical problems.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“If the actual discharge deviates from the plan, even just a little bit, we will deem it a threat to the safety and health of our people, and immediately ask Japan to stop,” said Park Gu-yeon, vice minister of government policy coordination.\n\nBut opposition politicians have raised concerns that South Korean waters may be affected by the release, accusing President Yoon Suk Yeol of overlooking the health risks to mend diplomatic ties with Tokyo.\n\n“The Yoon Suk Yeol administration is turning a blind eye to Japan’s dumping of nuclear-contaminated water into the sea,” said Kang Sun-woo, a spokeswoman for the main opposition Democratic Party.\n\nFukushima’s fishing and agricultural industries are also worried about potential reputational harm for their products, which still carry the stigma of radioactive exposure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Our position has not changed and we continue to be opposed,” Masanobu Sakamoto, head of the National Federation of Fisheries Cooperative Associations, said Monday after meeting with Kishida.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n“Our understanding about the safety of the treated water has deepened, but scientific safety and safety from a social point is different. Once the water is released, there will be reputational damage,” he said.\n\nFishing season in Fukushima is due to start Sept. 1, and the Japanese government has pledged to monitor the water quality and collect data every day following the release.\n\nIn Tokyo, about 230 people gathered in front of the prime minister’s office Tuesday to protest the plan, holding signs and chanting slogans such as “Listen to the fishermen” and “The release will impact future generations.”\n\nAccording to a recent Kyodo News poll, 88.1 percent of respondents expressed concern that the release will hurt Japan’s image abroad. The Japanese government has said it will allocate $200 million to compensate the fishing industry for any reputational impact, and $340 million to mitigate the impact on the local economy.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nPrime Minister Fumio Kishida announced Japan would begin discharging treated radioactive water from the Fukushima Daiichi plant into the sea as early as Thursday.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

The model has rapidly gained popularity, igniting discussions across social media platforms and becoming a trending topic. Users have shared various memes and opinions, praising its capabilities and disruptive impact on the AI industry.\n\nDeepSeek-R1’s associated application has surged in downloads, becoming the most downloaded free AI app on the US Apple App Store. It achieved the top spot in India across all app categories, surpassing major players such as ChatGPT and Google Gemini. Sensor Tower data highlights that the app climbed from rank 102 on January 25 to rank 1 by January 27, maintaining its position the following day.\n\nThe app has also performed exceptionally well in the productivity app category, leaping from rank 132 on January 18 to the top position by January 27, displacing ChatGPT. On Android’s Play Store, DeepSeek-R1 has shown significant improvement, climbing from rank 447 on January 16 to rank 15 by January 28, trailing Google Gemini by just one position.\n\nPowered by a reasoning-based AI model with 670 billion parameters, DeepSeek-R1 stands as the largest open-source language model to date. Experts have drawn comparisons between its performance and OpenAI’s GPT-4, particularly in tasks related to mathematics, coding, and reasoning. What sets DeepSeek apart is its cost-effective development process—while OpenAI reportedly spent over $100 million on GPT-4, DeepSeek achieved similar capabilities for just $6 million by leveraging less advanced hardware combined with Nvidia A100 chips.\n\nBeyond the United States, the app has gained immense popularity worldwide. It has become the most downloaded application in countries such as the UK, Australia, Singapore, and Canada. However, its expansion across Europe has been relatively slower, indicating potential challenges in broader global adoption.\n\nAlso Read :- Nakul Jain Steps Down as Paytm Payments Services CEO\n\nChina’s growing expertise in artificial intelligence is evident in DeepSeek’s success. The company’s rise aligns with Beijing’s strategic focus on transitioning from traditional manufacturing to cutting-edge technologies. Despite international restrictions on advanced chip exports to China, DeepSeek has demonstrated an ability to innovate using available resources, raising questions about the effectiveness of such trade limitations.\n\nLike other AI models developed in China, DeepSeek incorporates safeguards to steer clear of politically sensitive subjects. When prompted about the 1989 Tiananmen Square incident, for instance, the app responded with a disclaimer—reflecting the constraints imposed by government regulations. While this censorship may hinder its acceptance in certain international markets, the model maintains high accuracy in other domains by integrating reliable data sources.\n\nThe rapid ascent of DeepSeek signals a notable shift in the AI industry. By combining affordability, scalability, and advanced reasoning capabilities, the company has emerged as a strong competitor to major industry players. Its rise not only disrupts the global AI landscape but also underscores the increasing influence of Chinese tech startups on the international stage.\n\nBe a part of Elets Collaborative Initiatives.

Alarming ethical and practical challenges emerge from the use of LLMs, particularly in the medical field for the potential impact on public health. Infodemic is a trending topic in public health and the ability of LLMs to rapidly produce vast amounts of text could leverage misinformation spread at an unprecedented scale, this could create an “AI-driven infodemic,” a novel public health threat. Policies to contrast this phenomenon need to be rapidly elaborated, the inability to accurately detect artificial-intelligence-produced text is an unresolved issue.\n\nThe opportunities offered by LLMs in supporting scientific research are multiple and various models have already been tested in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks in this domain.\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have recently gathered attention with the release of ChatGPT, a user-centered chatbot released by OpenAI. In this perspective article, we retrace the evolution of LLMs to understand the revolution brought by ChatGPT in the artificial intelligence (AI) field.\n\n1. Introduction\n\n“ChatGPT” is a large language model (LLM) trained by OpenAI, an Artificial intelligence (AI) research and deployment company, released in a free research preview on November 30th 2022, to get users’ feedback and learn about its strengths and weaknesses (1) Previously developed LLMs were able to execute different natural language processing (NLP) tasks, but ChatGPT differs from its predecessors. It’s an AI chatbot optimized for dialog, especially good at interacting in a human-like conversation.\n\nWith the incredibly fast spread of ChatGPT, with over one million users in 5 days from its release, (2) many have tried out this tool to answer complex questions or to generate short texts. It is a small leap to infer that ChatGPT could be a valuable tool for composing scientific articles and research projects. But can these generated texts be considered plagiarism? (3, 4).\n\nIt took a while to adopt systems at the editorial level to recognize potential plagiarism in scientific articles, but intercepting a product generated by ChatGPT would be much more complicated.\n\nIn addition, the impact that this tool may have on research is situated within a background that has been profoundly affected after the COVID-19 pandemic (5). In particular, health research has been strongly influenced by the mechanisms of dissemination of information regarding SARS-CoV-2 through preprint servers that often allowed for rapid media coverage and the consequent impact on individual health choices (6, 7).\n\nEven more than scientific literature, social media have been the ground of health information dissemination during the COVID-19 pandemic, with the rise of a phenomenon known as infodemic (8).\n\nStarting from a background on the evolution of LLMs and the existing evidence on their use to support medical research, we focus on ChatGPT and speculate about its future impact on research and public health. The objective of this paper is to promote a debate on ChatGPT’s space in medical research and the possible consequences in corroborating public health threats, introducing the novel concept of “AI-driven infodemic.”\n\n2. The evolution of pre-trained large language models\n\nThe LLMs’ evolution in the last 5 years has been exponential and their performance in a plethora of different tasks has become impressive.\n\nBefore 2017, most NLP models were trained using supervised learning for particular tasks and could be used only for the task they were trained on (9).\n\nTo overcome those issues, the self-attention network architecture, also known as Transformer, (10) was introduced in 2017 and was used to develop two game-changing models in 2018: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) (11, 12).\n\nBoth models achieved superior generalization capabilities, thanks to their semi-supervised approach. Using a combination of unsupervised pre-training and supervised fine-tuning, these models can apply pre-trained language representations to downstream tasks.\n\nGPT models rapidly evolved in different versions, being trained on a larger corpus of textual data and with a growing number of parameters.\n\nThe third version of GPT (GPT-3), with 175 billion parameters, is 100 times bigger than GPT-2 and approximately two times the number of neurons in the human brain (13).\n\nGPT-3 can generate text that is appropriate for a wide range of contexts, but unfortunately, it often expresses unintended behaviors such as making up facts, generating biased text, or simply not following user instructions (14).\n\nThis can be explained since the objective of many LLMs, including GPT-3, is to predict the next element in a text, based on a large corpus of text data from the internet, (15) thus LLMs learn to replicate biases and stereotypes present in that data (16).\n\nHere comes the major problem of alignment: the difficulty of ensuring that a LLM is behaving in a way that is aligned with human values and ethical principles.\n\nAddressing the alignment problem for LLMs is an ongoing area of research and OpenAI developed a moderation system, trained to detect a broad set of categories of undesired content, including sexual and hateful content, violence, and other controversial topics (17).\n\nChatGPT incorporates a moderation system, but the true innovation lies in its user-centered approach, which was used to fine-tune the model from GPT-3 to follow the user instructions “helpfully and safely” (14).\n\nThis process started from InstructGPT, a LLM with “only” 1.3 billion parameters trained using reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), a combined approach of supervised learning, to obtain human feedback, and reinforcement learning using human preferences as a reward signal.\n\nRLHF is used for adapting the pre-trained model GPT-3 to the specific task of following users’ instructions. From the optimization of InstructGPT for dialog, ChatGPT was born.\n\nDespite these advancements, ChatGPT still sometimes writes plausible-sounding but incorrect or nonsensical answers, due to its inability of fact-checking and its knowledge limited until 2021 (1).\n\nIn Table 1 we summarize the strengths and weaknesses of large language models that can be considered important steps to understand the development of ChatGPT. The evolution of LLMs is still in its early stages and the release of GPT-4 on the 14th of March 2023 has been another step forward in LLMs’ rapid advancement. GPT-4 has already been integrated into ChatGPT and this model seems to be more reliable, creative, and able to handle much more nuanced instructions, even if only a few technical details on the model were provided by OpenAI, for competitive and safety concerns. (18) GPT-4 impact on health care delivery and medical research is expected to be huge, but its limitations need to be taken into account (19).\n\nTABLE 1\n\nTable 1. Large language models evolution toward ChatGTP: pros and cons of each model\n\n3. Large language models to support academic research\n\nOne potential application of LLM is in support of academic research. The scientific literature, with around 2.5 million papers published every year, (20) due to its magnitude is already beyond human handling capabilities.\n\nAI could be a solution to tame the scientific literature and support researchers in collecting the available evidence, (21) by generating summaries or recommendations of papers, which could make it easier for researchers to quickly get the key points of a scientific result. Overall, AI tools have the potential to make the discovery, consumption, and sharing of scientific results more convenient and personalized for scientists. The increasing demand for accurate biomedical text mining tools for extracting information from the literature led to the development of BioBERT, a domain-specific language representation model pre-trained on large-scale biomedical corpora (22).\n\nBioBERT outperforms previous models on biomedical NLP tasks mining, including named entity recognition, relation extraction, and question answering.\n\nAnother possible approach is the one of domain-specific foundation models, such as BioGPT and PubMedGPT 2.7B, (23, 24) that were trained exclusively on biomedical abstracts and papers and used for medical question answering and text generation.\n\nMed-PaLM, a LLM trained using few-shot prompting, exceeds previous state-of-the-art models on MedQA, a medical question answering dataset consisting of United States Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE) style questions (25). The performance of ChatGPT on USMLE was recently evaluated and it achieved around 50–60% accuracy across all examinations, near the passing threshold, but still inferior to Med-PaLM (26).\n\nGPT-4 exceeds the passing score on USMLE by over 20 points and outperforms earlier LLMs. Nevertheless, there is a large gap between competency and proficiency examinations and the successful use of LLMs in clinical applications (27).\n\nIn the NLP task of text summarization GPT-2 was one of the best-performing models used for summarizing COVID-19 scientific research topics, using a database with over 500,000 research publications on COVID-19 (CORD-19) (28, 29).\n\nCORD-19 was also used for the training of CoQUAD, a question-answering system, designed to find the most recent evidence and answer any related questions (30).\n\nA web-based chatbot that produces high-quality responses to COVID-19-related questions was also developed, this user-friendly approach was chosen to make the LLM more accessible to the general audience (31).\n\nLLMs have also been used for abstract screening for systematic reviews, this allows the use of unlabelled data in the initial step of scanning abstracts, thus saving researcher’s time and effort (32).\n\nLLMs facilitate the implementation of advanced code generation capabilities for statistical and data analytics, two large-scale AI-powered code generation tools have recently come into the spotlight:\n\nOpenAI Codex, a GPT language model fine-tuned on publicly available code from GitHub, (33) and DeepMind AlphaCode, designed to address the main challenges of competitive programming (34).\n\nOn one hand, AI tools can make programmers’ jobs easier, aid in education and make programming more accessible (35).\n\nOn the other hand, the availability of AI-based code generation raises concerns: the risk of using code generation models is users’ over-reliance on the generated outputs, especially non-programmers may quickly become accustomed to auto-suggested solutions (36).\n\nThe above-described deskilling issue is not limited to coding. If we conceive a scenario in which AI is extensively used for scientific production, we must consider the risk of deskilling in researchers’ writing abilities. Some have already raised concerns about the peril of seeing the conduct of research being significantly shaped through AI, leading to a decline in the author’s ability to craft meaningfully and substantively her objects of study (37).\n\nOur reflections highlight a growing interest in the use of LLMs in academic research, with the release of ChatGPT this interest has only increased (38).\n\n4. The revolution of ChatGPT and the potential impact on scientific literature production\n\nThe user-centered approach of ChatGPT is the paradigm shift that makes it different from previous LLMs. The revolutionary impact of ChatGPT does not lie in its technical content, which appears to be merely a different methodology for training, but in the different perspective that it is bringing. ChatGPT will probably be overtaken soon, but the idea of making AI accessible to the broader community and putting the user at the center will stand.\n\nThe accessibility and user-friendly interface of ChatGPT could induce researchers to use it more extensively than previous LLMs. ChatGPT offers the opportunity to streamline the work of researchers, providing valuable support throughout the scientific process, from suggesting research questions to generate hypotheses. Its ability to write scripts in multiple programming languages and provide clear explanations of how the code works, makes it a useful asset for improving understanding and efficiency. Examples of these ChatGPT’s abilities are provided in Figure 1.\n\nFIGURE 1\n\nFigure 1. ChatGPT output to our prompt requesting to make examples of its abilities to support researchers in suggesting research questions, generate hypotheses, writing scripts in multiple programming languages and providing explanations of how the code works.\n\nChatGPT can also be used to suggest titles, write drafts, and help to express complex concepts in fluent and grammatically correct scientific English. This can be particularly useful for researchers who may not have a strong background in writing or who are not native English speakers. By supplementing the work of researchers, rather than replacing it, automating many of the repetitive tasks, ChatGPT may help researchers focus their efforts on the most impactful aspects of their work.\n\nThe high interest of the scientific community in this tool is demonstrated by the rapid increase in the number of papers published on this topic, shortly after its release. The use of ChatGPT in scientific literature production has already become a reality during the writing of this draft, many authors stated to have used ChatGPT to write at least part of their papers (39). This underlines how ChatGPT has already been integrated into the research process, even before addressing ethical concerns and discussing common rules. For example, ChatGPT has been listed as the first author of four papers, (26, 40, 41, 42) without considering the possibility of “involuntary plagiarism” or intellectual property issues surrounding the output of the model.\n\nThe number of pre-prints produced using ChatGPT points out that the use of this technology is inevitable and a debate in the research community is a priority (43).\n\n5. Navigating the threats of ChatGPT in public health: AI-driven infodemic and research integrity\n\nA potential concern related to the emergence of LLMs is the submissiveness in following users’ instructions. Despite the limitations imposed by programmers, LLMs can be easily tricked into producing text on controversial topics, including misinforming content (44).\n\nThe ability of LLMs to generate texts similar to those composed by humans could be used to create fake news articles or other seemingly legitimate but actually fabricated or misleading content, (45, 46) without the reader realizing that the text is produced by AI (47).\n\nUnder this damaging matter, the counter-offensive rises: some authors highlight the importance of creating LLM detectors that can be able to identify fake news, (48) while others propose LLMs to support the enhancement of detector performance (49). Commonly used GPT-2 detectors were flawed in recognizing text written by AI when generated by ChatGPT (50), new detectors were rapidly developed and released to address this gap, but these tools do not perform well in identifying GPT-4 generated text. This poses a continuous unfair competition to improve detectors that need to follow the pace of LLMs’ rapid advancement, leaving a gap for malicious intent.\n\nAs a result, this poses a continuous unfair competition to improve detectors that need to follow the pace of LLMs’ rapid advancement, leaving a gap for malicious intent.\n\nThe absence of accurate detectors calls for precautionary measures, for example, the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) for its 2023 call for papers prohibited the use of LLMs such as ChatGPT in submitted drafts. However, ICML acknowledges that currently there is not any tool to verify compliance with this rule and thus they are relying on the discretion of participants and await the development of shared policies within the scientific community.\n\nMany scientific journals are questioning the policy matter, publishing editorials on the topic, and updating author’s guidelines (51).\n\nFor example, Springer Nature journals have been the first to add rules in the guide to authors: to avoid accountability issues, LLMs cannot be listed as authors and their use should be documented in the methods or acknowledgments sections (3). Also Elsevier created guidelines on the use of AI-assisted writing for scientific production, confirming the rules imposed by Springer and requiring the authors to specify the AI tools employed, giving details on their use. Elsevier declared to be committed to monitor the development around generative AI and to refine the policy if necessary (52).\n\nThe misuse of ChatGPT in scientific research could lead to the production of fake scientific abstracts, papers, and bibliographies. In the earlier versions of ChatGPT (up to the 15th December version), when asked to cite references to support its statements, the output was a list of fake bibliographic references. (e.g., fabricated output reference: Li, X., & Kim, Y. (2020). Fake academic papers generated by AI: A threat to the integrity of research. PLOS ONE, 15 (3), e0231891.)\n\nThe usage of real authors’ names, journals, and plausible titles makes the fake reference difficult to immediately spot. This calls for preventive actions, such as the mandatory use of the digital object identifier system (DOI), which could be used to rapidly and accurately identify fake references.\n\nIn fields where fake information can endanger people’s safety, such as medicine, journals may have to take a more rigorous approach to verify the information as accurate (53). A combined evaluation by more up-to-date AI-output detectors and human reviewers is necessary to identify AI-generated scientific abstracts and papers, though this process may be time-consuming and imperfect. We, therefore, suggest adopting a “detectable-by-design” policy: the release of new generative AI models by the tech industry to the public should be permitted only if the output generated by the AI is detectable and thus can be unequivocally identified as AI-produced. The impact that generating false and potentially mystifying texts can have on people’s health is huge. The issue of the dissemination of untruthful information has long been known: starting with the unforgettable Wakefield case and the then-generated disbelief that vaccines can cause autism, (54) to the current observation of non-conservative behavior evidenced by the various phases of the COVID-19 pandemic (55). In this context, it has been more evident than ever that junk and manipulative research, through underperforming studies or with study designs unfit to carry out the intended research objective, has had an impact on the behavior of the general population and, more worryingly, on health professionals (56).\n\nThe diffusion of misinformation conveyed through rapidly disseminated channels such as mass media and social networks, can generate the phenomenon known as infodemic (57). The consequence on the scientific framework is considerable, even with implications on possible healthcare choices, already a determining factor in the recent pandemic. (58) Infodemic can influence medical decision-making on treatment or preventive measures, (59, 60) for example some people used hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19 based on false or unproven information, endorsed by popular and influential people (61). The risk is that we may face a new health emergency where new information can be rapidly produced using LLMs to generate human-like texts ready to spread even if incorrect or manipulated. The concept of infodemic was introduced in 2003 by Rothkopf as an “epidemic of information,” (62) and evolved in 2020 after the COVID19 pandemic, integrating the element of rapid misinformation spreading (63). With the global diffusion of LLMs the infodemic concept must evolve again into the one of “AI-driven Infodemic.” Not only is it possible to rapidly disseminate misinformation via social media platforms and other outlets, but also to produce exponentially growing amounts of health-related information, regardless of one’s knowledge, skills, and intentions. Given the nature of social media content diffusion, LLMs could be used to create content specifically designed for target population groups and in order to go viral and foster misinformation spread. We foresee a scenario in which human-like AI-produced contents will dramatically exacerbate every future health threat that can generate infodemics, that from now on will be AI-driven. Social media and gray literature have already been the ground for infodemic, (63) but scientific literature could become a new and powerful means of disinformation campaigns. The potential of LLMs and in particular ChatGPT in easily generating human-like texts, could convey excessive and, without proper control, low-quality scientific literature production in the health field. The abundance of predatory journals, that accept articles for publication without performing quality checks for issues such as plagiarism or ethical approval, (64) could allow the flooding of the scientific literature with AI-generated articles on an unprecedented scale. The consequences on the integrity of the scientific process and the credibility of the literature would be dreadful (65).\n\n6. Discussion\n\nLarge language models have already shown hints of their potential in supporting scientific research and in the next months we expect a growing amount of papers talking about the use of ChatGPT in this field.\n\nThe accessibility and astonishing abilities of ChatGPT made it popular across the world and allowed it to achieve a milestone, setting AI conversational tools to the next level.\n\nBut soon after its release possible threats emerged, ChatGPT’s ability to follow user’s instruction is a double-edged sword: on one hand, this approach makes it great at interacting with humans, on the other hand being submissive ab origine exposes it to misuse, for example by generating convincing human-like misinformation.\n\nThe field of medical research may be a great source for both opportunities and threats coming from this novel approach.\n\nGiven that the scientific community has not yet determined the principles to follow for a helpful and safe use of this disruptive technology, the risks coming from the fraudulent and unethical use of LLMs in the health context cannot be ignored and should be assessed with a proactive approach.\n\nWe define the novel concept of “AI-driven infodemic,” a public health threat coming from the use of LLMs to produce a vast amount of scientific articles, fake news, and misinformative contents. The “AI-driven infodemic” is a consequence of the use of LLM’s ability to write large amounts of human-like texts in a short period of time, not only with malicious intent, but in general without any scientific ground and support. Beyond text-based content, other AI tools, such as generative-adversarial networks, could also generate audio and video Deepfakes that could be used to disseminate misinformation content, especially on social media (66). Political Deepfakes already contributed toward generalized indeterminacy and disinformation (67).\n\nTo address this public health threat is important to raise awareness and rapidly develop policies through a multidisciplinary effort, updating the current WHO public health research agenda for managing infodemics (68). There is a need for policy action to ensure that the benefits of LLMs are not outweighed by the risks they pose. In this context, we propose the detectable-by-design approach, which involves building LLMs with features that make it easier to detect when they are being used to produce fake news or scientific articles. However, implementing this approach could slow down the development process of LLMs, and for this reason, it might not be readily accepted by AI companies. The constitution of groups of experts inside health international agencies (e.g., WHO, ECDC) dedicated to monitor the use of LLMs for fake news and scientific articles production is needed, as the scenario is rapidly evolving and the AI-driven infodemic threat is forthcoming. Such groups could work closely with AI companies to develop effective strategies for detecting and preventing the use of LLMs for nefarious purposes. Additionally, there might be a need for greater regulation and oversight of the AI industry to ensure that LLMs are developed and used responsibly. Recently, the President of the Italian Data Protection Authority (DPA) has taken action against Open AI for serious breaches of the European legislation on personal data processing and protection (69). The DPA has imposed a temporary ban on ChatGPT in Italy due to the company’s failure to provide adequate privacy information to its users its and lack of a suitable legal basis for data collection. The absence of a suitable legal basis for data collection raises serious concerns about the ethical implications of using personal data without consent or an adequate legal framework.\n\nIn the WHO agenda, AI is considered a possible ally to fight infodemics, allowing automatic monitoring for misinformation detection; but the rise of LLMs and in particular ChatGPT should raise concerns that it could play an opposite role in this phenomenon.\n\nLLMs will continue to improve and rapidly become precious allies for researchers, but the scientific community needs to ensure that the advances made possible by ChatGPT and other AI technologies are not overshadowed by the risks they pose. All stakeholders should foster the development and deployment of these technologies aligned with the values and interests of society. It is crucial to increase understanding of AI challenges of transparency, accountability, and fairness in order to develop effective policies. A science-driven debate to develop shared principles and legislation is necessary to shape a future in which AI has a positive impact on public health, not having such a conversation could result in a dangerous AI-fueled future (70).\n\nData availability statement\n\nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/Supplementary material, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author.\n\nAuthor contributions\n\nLDA, FB, and GA conceived the paper, performed the literature search, and drafted the manuscript.

Facebook is renaming itself Meta.\n\nAfter weeks of intense scrutiny brought on after a whistleblower leaked thousands of internal research documents and memos to regulators, lawmakers and the press, Facebook tried to turn a page by focusing on its futuristic technology.\n\nTo Mark Zuckerberg , Facebook's CEO, the future of technology is about digital worlds where we can interact with one another. These worlds, which he calls the \"metaverse,\" will allow for new types of art, music, entertainment and business. And, the company said, it'll be built responsibly, with privacy and interoperability in mind.\n\n\"If we all work at it, and within the next decade, the metaverse will reach a billion people, host hundreds of billions of dollars of digital commerce, and support jobs for millions of creators and developers,\" Zuckerberg said during a presentation at Facebook's Connect conference on Thursday. \"We are fully committed to this.\"\n\nWatch this: Zuckerberg unveils new company name: Meta 02:27\n\nFacebook's metaverse efforts are still in their infancy, and as part of them the company announced a series of software tools including technology that lets people control programs with their voice or hands. Facebook is also expanding its hardware offerings.\n\n\"This is the next chapter of our work, and, we believe, for the internet overall,\" Zuckerberg said.\n\nMeta's efforts come as the company confronts one of its largest ever controversies. Over the past week, more than a dozen news outlets have published stories based on that trove of leaked Facebook documents, following a series that The Wall Street Journal published about them called The Facebook Files. The stories pointed to internal research, memos and debate that underscored the challenges the company faces as it tries to police its social networks around the globe.\n\nZuckerberg addressed the leaked documents on Monday, saying the company is trying to balance free expression with efforts to reduce harmful content.

The collapse of SVB, a key player in the tech and venture capital community, leaves companies and wealthy individuals largely unsure of what will happen to their money. According to press releases from regulators, the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation closed SVB and named the FDIC as the receiver. The FDIC in turn has created the Deposit Insurance National Bank of Santa Clara, which now holds the insured deposits from SVB.\n\nwatch now\n\nThe FDIC said in the announcement that insured depositors will have access to their deposits no later than Monday morning. SVB's branch offices will also reopen at that time, under the control of the regulator. According to the press release, SVB's official checks will continue to clear.\n\nA Brinks armored truck sits parked in front of the shuttered Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) headquarters on March 10, 2023 in Santa Clara, California.

The FDIC said uninsured depositors will get receivership certificates for their balances. The regulator said it will pay uninsured depositors an advanced dividend within the next week, with potential additional dividend payments as the regulator sells SVB's assets. Whether depositors with more than $250,000 ultimately get all their money back will be determined by the amount of money the regulator gets as it sells Silicon Valley assets or if another bank takes ownership of the remaining assets. There were concerns in the tech community that until that process unfolds, some companies may have issues making payroll. As of the end of December, SVB had roughly $209 billion in total assets and $175.4 billion in total deposits, according to the press release. The FDIC said it was unclear what portion of those deposits were above the insurance limit. The last U.S. bank failure of this size was Washington Mutual in 2008, which had $307 billion in assets.\n\nBiggest bank failures since 2001 Bank Assets Deposits Washington Mutual $307 billion $188 billion Silicon Valley Bank $212 billion $173 billion IndyMac $32 billion $19 billion Colonial Bank $25 billion $20 billion Guaranty Bank $13 billion $12 billion\n\nSource: FDIC/FactSet\n\nSVB was a major bank for venture-backed companies, which were already under pressure due to higher interest rates and a slowdown for initial public offerings that made it more difficult to raise additional cash. The closure of SVB would impact not only the deposits, but also credit facilities and other forms of financing. The FDIC said loan customers of SVB should continue to make their payments as normal. The move represents a rapid downfall for SVB. On Wednesday, the bank announced it was looking to raise more than $2 billion in additional capital after suffering a $1.8 billion loss on asset sales.\n\nA notice hangs on the door of Silicon Valley Bank located in San Francisco, California, U.S. March 10, 2023.

USA TODAY\n\nEverything feels fragile. People, especially.\n\nAs the coronavirus spreads across the globe, there's recognition its toll will exceed the scope of the virus itself. Deaths will be caused by COVID-19 – closing in on 500 in the U.S. alone as of Monday – and long term health problems. Others will be frayed by the havoc, loneliness and financial insecurity caused by the disease.\n\nCoronavirus: What is social distancing? When should I quarantine versus isolate?\n\nThe data on past outbreaks and suicide is conflicting, but suicide prevention experts say it's reasonable to expect the current pandemic will lead to increased suicide risk for certain populations. Social distancing and quarantines may trigger those currently dealing with suicidal thoughts. And research shows the social and economic fallout from the pandemic may amplify the risk for some people well after the outbreak has ended.\n\nThose deaths will be harder to count.\n\n\"There are ramifications, sometimes fatal, with events like these that are not just related to getting infected or dying from infection or consequences of infection,\" said Eric Caine, co-director of the Center for the Study of Prevention of Suicide at the University of Rochester Medical Center. It is important \"to honestly and openly consider that there might be adverse events that occur in the midst of social distancing.\"\n\nSocial connection has become a crucial part of the language of suicide prevention. The more connected people are, experts say, the less likely they are to die by suicide. But the public health approach to stem the coronavirus requires people to forgo in-person connections – conversations, touch, the serendipitous encounters that make up the social fabric of people's lives.\n\nTips: 10 things to help you ease anxiety around coronavirus\n\nThe pandemic also has created major challenges around mental health care. Many therapists are no longer seeing clients in person, and not everyone has insurance that will cover telemedicine.\n\n\"Isolation is a big trigger for a lot of people,\" said Norine VanderHooven, a licensed clinical social worker in California. \"With SARS or H1N1 it was on such a different scale than what we're dealing with now. People are becoming so anxious because they don't know what to expect. Anxiety is fear of the unexpected or unknown.\"\n\nDanielle Sinay, 28, is a writer in Brooklyn who has a history of suicidal thoughts. She's been diagnosed with a panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. While she isn't entirely isolated – she lives with her husband and four pets – disruptions to her routine and the proliferation of unknowns have left her vulnerable.\n\n\"It's so scary, it's almost like ... I would rather be dead,\" she said. \"I mean, I wouldn't be, but sometimes I get so scared it feels like that.\"\n\nNadine Kaslow, a professor of psychiatry at the Emory University School of Medicine, said not all people who have experienced suicidal thoughts or survived previous attempts will react to the pandemic the same way.\n\nIf someone's suicidality stems from insecurities about self-esteem or self-worth, for example, the pandemic may not be as impactful as it would be for someone who has an anxiety disorder or suffers from catastrophic thinking.\n\n\"There is certainly going to be a group of people who are suicidal where this is just one more stress for them,\" Kaslow said. \"For others it could be a final stress, not even COVID itself, but everything that comes with it, all the financial stresses, trying to take care of kids at home, people you love dying, getting sick – the list goes on and on.\"\n\nThe ripple effects\n\nExperts caution there is no single cause of suicide. But getting laid off, losing a safe place to live and taking on new family responsibilities are the kinds of adversity that can elevate suicide risk.\n\nSelf-isolation: What do you do when the bigger danger is at home?\n\nLooking at a past disease outbreak like SARS in Hong Kong in 2002 and 2003 gives some indication of what may lie ahead. Social disengagement, stress and anxiety among some older adults resulted in an exceptionally high rate of suicide deaths, according to a 2010 study. Caine said Hong Kong's disrupted economy may have lead to increased suicides. He is concerned the U.S. may see the same.\n\nResearch shows unemployment is a risk factor for suicide. Benjamin Miller, chief strategy officer for Well Being Trust, a national foundation committed to advancing mental health issues, said the virus outbreak already is bringing into sharp relief risk factors for poor health such as loneliness and social isolation.\n\n“Add to these social factors the possibility of an economic downturn, which may include job loss, and we are looking at a perfect storm of problems that will only exacerbate the deaths of despair that our nation still has not addressed,\" Miller said.\n\nVanderHooven said at least one of her clients attempted suicide because of impending job loss.\n\n\"We need to normalize people's feelings,\" she said. \"The truth is we don't know what's going to happen.\"\n\nTaking care of one another\n\nIn a moment like this, Caine said people can mitigate risk to vulnerable populations by doing their best to care for one another. The crisis is a collective one, not an individual one. No one should have to endure it alone.\n\n\"Even in the midst of social separation, there are ways where we can pull together to bring out warmth and cohesion,\" he said.\n\nCaine is encouraged by what he's seen already. Communities are mounting efforts to identify people at risk of isolation. Churches are reaching out. Parents are setting up Facebook groups to exchange information on (and to collectively lament the challenges of) homeschooling their kids. Local organizations are helping older adults with emergency needs.\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed a sweeping multibillion-dollar emergency aid package last week that will provide paid sick leave for Americans who are in quarantine, helping a family member who is infected with COVID-19 or have children whose schools have closed as a result of the coronavirus outbreak. More economic relief plans are underway.\n\nThese efforts, Caine said, will make a difference.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic has forced many people to question the future and to some extent their mortality. For people struggling with suicidal ideation, existential questions are familiar. But Kaslow said it's possible that for some suicidal people, the coronavirus could end up being life-saving.\n\n\"There's going to be a group of people, I imagine, who are actually going to do better because somehow they are going to find a way to do something meaningful during this time,\" she said.\n\n\"They'll have to take care of their kids in a way they didn't have to before, or they'll be the one bringing food to people who are sick. Somehow in this national global crisis, they'll find a space to do something that matters. They'll find purpose.\"\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\nThe Suicide Prevention Resource Center has compiled specific resources to support mental health and coping with the coronavirus.\n\nIf you or someone you know may be struggling with suicidal thoughts, you can call the U.S. National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-TALK (8255) any time day or night, or chat online.\n\nCrisis Text Line also provides free, 24/7, confidential support via text message to people in crisis when they dial 741741.\n\nAlia E.

Texas takes pride in its free market–fueled economic environment that provides low-cost housing, cheap electricity, and plenty of personal transportation along with low taxes. The problem is that the absence of rules and governance can come back and create harm if you happen to live on a more crowded and complex planet, like the one we have here on Earth. Climate change, pandemics, traffic jams, toxic air, polluted water and poisoned land cannot be addressed by the free market alone. The market can be used to produce needed goods and services, but the idea that markets and civilization itself can survive without rules is absurd idiocy.\n\nTexas this past week was a case in point. The electric grid in Texas is built for efficiency, but it is not built for climate resilience. As Katherine Blunt and Russell Gold reported in the Wall Street Journal:\n\n“A fundamental flaw in the freewheeling Texas electricity market left millions powerless and freezing in the dark this week during a historic cold snap. The core problem: Power providers can reap rewards by supplying electricity to Texas customers, but they aren’t required to do it and face no penalties for failing to deliver during a lengthy emergency. That led to the fiasco that left millions of people in the nation’s second-most-populous state without power for days. A severe storm paralyzed almost every energy source, from power plants to wind turbines, because their owners hadn’t made the investments needed to produce electricity in subfreezing temperatures. While power providers collectively failed, the companies themselves didn’t break any rules.”\n\nThe quest for efficiency and low cost led to under-investment and energy facilities poorly prepared for cold weather. Texas does better in hot weather, but climate change is altering weather patterns and extreme weather events are becoming more common. While we need to mitigate climate change and will need government-driven public policy to do that, we must also adapt to the climate change that is already underway. That need to adapt also requires a more active government presence than the ideologues running Texas want to allow.\n\nEnergy is not the only industry damaged by uncontrolled market forces. Health care is also suffering from the impact of health insurance companies on hospitals and medical care. The shortage of intensive care beds during the COVID-19 pandemic can be traced to efforts to enhance cost-effectiveness in hospitals. Extra capacity is considered waste that must be reflected in the price of care. Eliminate that capacity and costs can be reduced. Instead of paying for and storing extra personal protective equipment, hospitals utilize just-in-time supply chains to meet immediate needs. The system worked well until a pandemic hit and the supply chains could not meet dramatically increased demand.\n\nI am not arguing against just-in-time production or global supply chains, but rather for adequate public investment in infrastructure and supplies to meet the needs of emergencies. The public interest requires rules that may inhibit unfettered markets, but if regulations are designed with care, we can retain the benefits brought by the competitive marketplace. In some instances, we won’t need regulation but instead, require public infrastructure investment. For example, a more resilient electric grid could consist of thousands of microgrids knitted together into a national smart grid. Some of the capital for rebuilding the grid could come from federal infrastructure investment- the type needed to revive the American economy. The modern grid will produce energy at lower costs, making our economy more productive. A more robust system of public health will require enhanced local virus testing, tracing and isolation capacity and biological scanning of air travelers by the TSA. Travelers can fund the TSA, but local taxes will need to pay for local public health capacity.\n\nTo resume and maintain our way of life in a complex, interconnected global economy, we will need to develop a set of rules and build the institutional capacity needed to protect us from 21st-century threats. These range from terrorism to pandemics to the impact of extreme weather events. Our ability to enjoy the benefits of modern technology requires that public management become more effective and efficient. It is time to reject the idea that government is the problem and the solution to our problems is to “starve the beast” and disinvest in the public sector. That may have been an answer to some of the issues faced by Ronald Reagan and his contemporaries in 1980, but it is completely inadequate to the issues we are facing four decades later.\n\nDeregulation has failed. But reimposing rigid rules is unlikely to result in better outcomes. We need to develop incentives and disincentives that result in private behaviors that meet the requirements of the public interest. Some of that is pure command and control regulation. Every traffic system requires some traffic lights. But, tax credits and deductions, public investments, government-funded research and other forms of subsidies must be designed to achieve public ends rather than reward powerful interests. This will not be easy to do. We need to develop regulatory strategies that incentivize private behaviors to meet public needs. One size does not fit all, and we need to recognize that in formulating and implementing regulation.\n\nOur ability to measure performance is far greater than it was in the middle of the 20th century. The technology of observation, communication and information has advanced dramatically and can enable more targeted and effective rules. Remote sensing can replace human inspections and some auditing functions can be automated. We need to apply ingenuity and design to more effective and flexible policies and public investments. Effective public management requires financial investment, brainpower and political will. We should use the market to meet our needs rather than worship the market as the solution to all problems.\n\nA year of COVID-19 lockdown has demonstrated the inadequacy of what remains of our public sector. Our unwillingness to tax ourselves and invest in public sector infrastructure or organizational capacity has resulted in disease, death and trillions of dollars of economic damage. Last week in Texas, the free market in energy delivered cold and misery. For the past year, we have struggled to contain a virus that could have been isolated and eliminated with a more robust, competent system of public health. The benefits of modern technology bring costs. We need to understand those negative impacts and protect ourselves from them.\n\nIn a world where disinformation abounds and reality has become controversial, it will be a challenge to develop a more sophisticated, fact-based system of governance. A large number of Americans do not believe that our climate is changing and do not believe that COVID-19 is real. They think that Donald Trump’s reelection was stolen by nefarious forces and that the January 6th insurrection was led by Antifa. Despite these fact-free accounts, hundreds of insurrectionists are headed to courtrooms, thousands of COVID victims have died and millions of climate deniers in Texas suffered last week from the impact of climate-induced extreme weather. My hope is that Americans will accept reality and reject ideology. We need pragmatism and we need to be willing to pay the hand we are dealt. We saw signs of that in the recent election and in the poll data that indicates 70% of the country favors the Biden pandemic relief package. America’s government is a sleeping giant that seems to be slowly waking up from decades of slumber.\n\nViews and opinions expressed here are those of the authors, and do not necessarily reflect the official position of the Columbia Climate School, Earth Institute or Columbia University.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nOver four million customers were without power in Texas.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert at causal reasoning."}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n### CONTEXT\n[Doc 1]\nTitle: Climate emergency declarations by local governments– what comes next?\nContent: Climate emergency declarations are one of the strongest climate action policy statements, representing an acknowledgement of the increasingly serious scientific statements of climate change impacts, the far-reaching systemic effects of these impacts, and the urgency for taking action to mitigate the causes1. In 2007, UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon stated “this is an emergency, and for emergency situations, we need emergency action1. The first declaration of a climate emergency was made by City of Darebin, an inner-north municipality of Melbourne, Australia on 5 December 20162. Indeed, it has been suggested that local governments in the State of Victoria (where Melbourne is located) are frontrunners in climate action3. Seventy of the seventy-nine Victorian local governments are now members of one of the eight Victorian-based regional groupings of local governments focused on climate change action (Victorian Greenhouse Alliances)4. The Greenhouse Alliances are focused on advocacy, knowledge sharing, and developing and implementing ‘innovative, regional strategies and projects typically beyond the reach of individual councils4.\n\nBy September 2023, 2,343 jurisdictions in 40 countries had declared a climate emergency5. The rate of new declarations in Australia and globally has dropped in recent years (the rate of declarations appears to have peaked in 2019); reasons for this are not the focus of this research. Rather, this research is focused on what comes after the declaration of a climate emergency, and which elements of ‘transformative’ climate action are included in these post-declaration strategic planning responses.\n\nThe declaration of a climate emergency, as a strong statement of intent, has the potential to stimulate more ambitious local action, yet in some cases may act primarily as a political gesture only6. The declaration itself may have been motivated by pressure from civil society7, or may be perceived as a continuation and amplification of previous experience of environmental action within local government8. While some have raised concerns that “much of the talk about climate emergency by local government may merely be symbolic and broadly aligned with their existing local environmental and climate roles and policies9, others have suggested that emergency declarations may be “catalysing councils beyond symbolic declarations potentially opening up space for change and disruption10. This raises the question of what planning and subsequent action follows or is prompted by an emergency declaration. An analysis of urban planning documents of selected US cities, found that “although cities are beginning to address differential vulnerability and adaptive capacity, more work is required to tackle unequal socioeconomic structures and their contributions to underlying drivers of climate injustice11. Some researchers12,13 and members of civil society14 have pointed to the potential for ‘emergency’ and ‘crisis’ framings to potentially reinforce coercive and controlling state powers, potentially involving ‘temporarily suspend[ing] democracy and civil liberties’, and maintaining existing injustices. Concern has also been raised that the ‘international language’ of climate emergency may obscure or displace the existing diversity of local responses15.\n\nResearch conducted on Swedish cities that have declared a climate emergency, examined the extent to which their climate strategies exhibit a climate emergency mode16. The research applied the Climate Emergency Response Attributes Framework2 to assess the extent to which the cities’ strategies have “moved beyond business as usual to a complex emergency response for climate change16. However, the research noted that none of the cities have released climate emergency plans following their emergency declarations, and so the analysis was applied to their existing climate strategies16. Research of 344 cities in the European Cities Mission (a European Commission project aiming to deliver 100 climate neutral cities in Europe by 2030), found that “out of 63 cities with a CED [climate emergency declaration], 59 (93.7%) have developed an LCP [Local Climate Plan], which seems to suggest that the declaration of climate emergency can reach cities not previously engaged in local climate planning17. However, the analysis did not extend to examining the contents of the subsequently developed climate plans to assess their level of ambition, or how the framing of the emergency declaration was then reflected in planning for action.\n\nResearch on climate emergency declarations has analysed the processes and actors involved in the lead up to the emergency declaration, and the factors involved to trigger an emergency declaration6,7,8. There has been less focus on subsequent action planning. Indeed, “although there is near uniformity of political desire to tackle climate change, action planning is very much work in progress with tight delivery timelines, … significant divergence in approaches, and an unclear role for the citizen18. This research therefore aims to examine what comes after the declaration. The research seeks to understand whether there is evidence that an emergency declaration is followed by climate emergency planning that reflects the urgency, complexity and comprehensiveness associated with recognition and declaration of ‘emergency’ status. The research focuses on local governments in Victoria, Australia, the location of the first climate emergency declaration, and addresses the following questions:\n\nWhich local governments have declared climate emergencies and why?\n\nDid the declaration trigger the development of a climate emergency action plan? If so, what are the key goals or objectives?\n\nWhich ‘transformative’ elements were included in these plans?\n\n‘Transformative’ responses - ‘deep, broad, and rapid society-wide changes’ are increasingly called for by both academics and policy makers, yet there are few shared definitions for ‘transformation’ terminology19. ‘Transformation’ has been applied separately to climate change mitigation (emissions reductions)19; and adaptation and resilience (addressing current and future climate change impacts)20,21,22. Others have proposed a definition of ‘climate change transformation’ which includes the integration of adaptation and mitigation goals23. This latter approach has been expanded to encompass other dimensions including collaboration, integration and equity24. Catalysing more ‘transformative’ responses requires ‘a greater sense of spatial, temporal and social justice22; transformative approaches should be contextualised to effectively respond in different regions, yet there are also opportunities for guiding ‘transformative climate action across scales25.\n\nFor this research, we consider that to qualify as ‘transformative’, action plans must encompass a range of dimensions26,27, that seek to balance comprehensiveness and feasibility. ‘Transformative’ responses necessitate moving beyond ‘business-as-usual2 and require action across numerous sectors and contexts28, reinforcing the complexity of planning climate responses. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), in its Sixth Assessment report, highlights the urgency for action, spanning both mitigation and adaptation; actions must be equitable and inclusive, to reduce losses and damage for people and nature28. IPCC’s recognition of both people and nature reinforces the importance of integrating biodiversity and nature with climate action29, and acknowledgement that without a shared focus on biodiversity conservation and restoration, effective climate action is not possible30,31. For jurisdictions such as local governments that are planning their climate actions and responses, managing the scope of this planning is important, and requires a balance between comprehensiveness and feasibility, targeting areas within the jurisdiction’s control. Bringing together all these considerations, we propose that the dimensions required for ‘transformative’ climate change responses include the following elements (discussed in more detail in the following paragraphs):\n\nintegration across the mitigation-adaptation dichotomy;\n\ncollaboration and integration within organisations, across sectors, and levels of government;\n\nintegration of climate change and biodiversity actions;\n\nforegrounding and integration of First Peoples’ perspectives; and\n\nintegration of justice and equity considerations.\n\nIntegrating across the mitigation-adaptation dichotomy: Climate change mitigation actions focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, while adaptation actions focus on adapting to current and future climate change impacts. The two aspects of climate change action are often disconnected, and addressed separately in policy, strategy, action planning, and on-ground implementation32. Yet integrating across the ‘mitigation-adaptation dichotomy32 can promote the avoidance of maladaptation (adaptation that increases emissions, or short-term adaptation that hampers long term adaptation)23, as well as identifying opportunities for synergies and efficiencies.\n\nCollaboration and integration within organisations, across sectors, and levels of government: The responsibility for planning and implementing climate actions, whether mitigation or adaptation, often spans multiple organisational policies and departments. IPCC has highlighted the importance of integrating climate change actions into “policy making, planning, and decision making across levels and sectors28,33. In a review of climate adaptation policy research33, a spectrum of approaches for ‘climate policy integration’ is identified, from coordination to harmonisation to prioritisation (the latter being the strongest approach). The elements to be considered to ensure integration include comprehensiveness, aggregation, consistency, incorporation, and prioritisation33.\n\nIntegration of climate and biodiversity action: With the recognition that climate change and biodiversity loss are coupled crises29,30, there are increasing calls for integrating climate change responses with ecological restoration responses34,35, to ensure that climate mitigation actions do not negatively impact biodiversity, and indeed provide positive biodiversity habitat benefits36. Likewise, there are opportunities for ecosystem-based approaches, such as nature-based solutions, to contribute to both mitigation and adaptation efforts37,38.\n\nForegrounding First Peoples’ perspectives: Planning in settler colonial countries such as Australia takes place on First Peoples’ lands39. First Peoples’ relationship with their land (‘Country’ as it is known in Australia) is characterised by responsibilities of Custodianship – reciprocal responsibilities to people, culture, and Country40,41. Climate-just approaches must foreground First Peoples’ aspirations and knowledges of their land42. IPCC recognises the essential place of First Peoples in climate planning and implementation: “Cooperation, and inclusive decision making, with Indigenous Peoples and local communities, as well as recognition of inherent rights of Indigenous Peoples, is integral to successful adaptation and mitigation”43.\n\nIntegrating justice and equity considerations: The IPCC highlights the equity and justice dimensions of both the uneven and unjust distribution of climate change impacts. In particular there is a disconnect between those responsible for emissions production and those who benefit from fossil-fuel driven development and affluence, compared to those who are most vulnerable and burdened by climate change impacts44. “Social justice and equity are core aspects of climate-resilient development pathways44. A focus on ‘climate justice’ and ‘just transitions28,45 requires consideration of integrating climate mitigation and adaptation measures that provide wider sustainable development benefits28. Fundamental to justice and equity consideration is inclusive decision-making, ensuring that local communities and civil society are able to be involved in climate planning and decision-making11. The growing ambition amongst cities to meet climate change mitigation targets for 1.5 °C needs to also acknowledge and address the justice and equity concerns that are associated with achieving the necessary action46, to ensure a just transition to a net zero future economy and society.\n\nThese elements, we argue, are the constituent parts of a comprehensive approach to transformative climate action. We apply these to form the basis for our analytical framework to assess the extent to which climate emergency action plans of Victorian local councils constitute ‘transformative’ approaches. The following section presents results of our analysis of the Victorian local councils’ climate emergency action plans, including which councils have declared an emergency, the motivators or drivers for the declarations, and the ‘transformative’ elements included in their emergency plans. The following discussion section highlights how these results relate to research from other cities and municipalities internationally and specifically considers the role of Victorian Greenhouse Alliances in promoting climate responses amongst Victorian local governments. The research methods are included at the end of the paper.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nGovernor Newsom declared a state of emergency in Napa, Sonoma, and Shasta counties.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

It is not difficult to imagine how, once Trump is no longer President, his most fanatical supporters could apply this caveat to all levels of government, including local law enforcement. At the rally on December 12th, Nicholas Fuentes underscored the irreconcilability of a radical-right ethos and pro-police, pro-military patriotism: “When they go door to door mandating vaccines, when they go door to door taking your firearms, when they go door to door taking your children, who do you think it will be that’s going to do that? It’s going to be the police and the military.”\n\nDuring Trump’s speech on January 6th, he said, “The media is the biggest problem we have.” He went on, “It’s become the enemy of the people. . . . We gotta get them straightened out.” Several journalists were attacked during the siege. Men assaulted a Times photographer inside the Capitol, near the rotunda, as she screamed for help. After National Guard soldiers and federal agents finally arrived and expelled the Trump supporters, some members of the mob shifted their attention to television crews in a park on the east side of the building. Earlier, a man had accosted an Israeli journalist in the middle of a live broadcast, calling him a “lying Israeli” and telling him, “You are cattle today.” Now the Trump supporters surrounded teams from the Associated Press and other outlets, chasing off the reporters and smashing their equipment with bats and sticks.\n\nThere was a ritualistic atmosphere as the crowd stood in a circle around the piled-up cameras, lights, and tripods. “This is the old media,” a man said, through a megaphone. “This is what it looks like. Turn off Fox, turn off CNN.”\n\nOutside the Capitol, rioters surrounded news crews, chasing off the reporters and smashing their equipment with bats. Photograph by Balazs Gardi for The New Yorker\n\nAnother man, in a black leather jacket and wraparound sunglasses, suggested that journalists should be killed: “Start makin’ a list! Put all those names down, and we start huntin’ them down, one by one!”\n\n“Traitors to the guillotine!”\n\n“They won’t be able to walk down the streets!”\n\nThe radicalization of the Republican Party has altered the world of conservative media, which is, in turn, accelerating that radicalization. On November 7th, Fox News, which has often seemed to function as a civilian branch of the Trump Administration, called the race for Biden, along with every other major network. Furious, Trump encouraged his supporters to instead watch Newsmax, whose ratings skyrocketed as a result. Newsmax hosts have dismissed covid-19 as a “scamdemic” and have speculated that Republican politicians were being infected with the virus as a form of “sabotage.” The Newsmax headliner Michelle Malkin has praised Fuentes as one of the “New Right leaders” and the groypers as “patriotic.”\n\nAt the December 12th rally, I ran into the Pennsylvania Three Percent member whom I’d met in Harrisburg on November 7th. Then he had been a Fox News devotee, but since Election Day he’d discovered Newsmax. “I’d had no idea what it even was,” he told me. “Now the only thing that anyone I know watches anymore is Newsmax. They ask the hard questions.”\n\nIt seems unlikely that what happened on January 6th will turn anyone who inhabits such an ecosystem against Trump. On the contrary, there are already indications that the mayhem at the Capitol will further isolate and galvanize many right-wingers. The morning after the siege, an alternative narrative, pushed by Jones and other conspiracists, went viral on Parler: the assault on the Capitol had actually been instigated by Antifa agitators impersonating Trump supporters. Mo Brooks, an Alabama congressman who led the House effort to contest the certification of the Electoral College votes, tweeted, “Evidence growing that fascist ANTIFA orchestrated Capitol attack with clever mob control tactics.” (Brooks had warmed up the crowd for Trump on January 6th, with a speech whose bellicosity far surpassed the President’s. “Today is the day American patriots start takin’ down names and kickin’ ass!” he’d hollered.) Most of the “evidence” of Antifa involvement seems to be photographs of rioters clad in black. Never mind that, in early January, Tarrio, the Proud Boys chairman, wrote on Parler, “We might dress in all BLACK for the occasion.” Or that his colleague Joe Biggs, addressing antifascist activists, added, “We are going to smell like you, move like you, and look like you.”\n\nNot long after the Brooks tweet, I got a call from a woman I’d met at previous Stop the Steal rallies. She had been unable to come to D.C., owing to a recent surgery. She asked if I could tell her what I’d seen, and if the stories about Antifa were accurate. She was upset—she did not believe that “Trump people” could have done what the media were alleging. Before I responded, she put me on speakerphone. I could hear other people in the room. We spoke for a while, and it was plain that they desperately wanted to know the truth. I did my best to convey it to them as I understood it.\n\nLess than an hour after we got off the phone, the woman texted me a screenshot of a CNN broadcast with a news bulletin that read, “antifa has taken responsiblitly for storming capital hill.” The image, which had been circulating on social media, was crudely Photoshopped (and poorly spelled). “Thought you might want to see this,” she wrote.\n\nIn the year 2088, a five-hundred-pound time capsule is scheduled to be exhumed from beneath the stone slabs of Freedom Plaza. Inside an aluminum cylinder, historians will find relics honoring the legacy of Martin Luther King, Jr.: a Bible, clerical robes, a cassette tape with King’s “I Have a Dream” speech, part of which he wrote in a nearby hotel. What will those historians know about the lasting consequences of the 2020 Presidential election, which culminated with the incumbent candidate inciting his supporters to storm the Capitol and threaten to lynch his adversaries? Will this year’s campaign against the democratic process have evolved into a durable insurgency? Something worse?\n\nOn January 8th, Trump was permanently banned from Twitter. Five days later, he became the only U.S. President in history to be impeached twice. (During the Capitol siege, the man in the hard hat withdrew from one of the Senate desks a manual, from a year ago, titled “PROCEEDINGS OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE IN THE IMPEACHMENT TRIAL OF PRESIDENT DONALD JOHN TRUMP.”) Although the President has finally agreed to submit to a peaceful transition of power, he has admitted no responsibility for the deadly riot. “People thought that what I said was totally appropriate,” he told reporters on January 12th.\n\nHe will not disappear. Neither will the baleful forces that he has conjured and awakened. This is why iconoclasts like Fuentes and Jones have often seemed more exultant than angry since Election Day. For them, the disappointment of Trump’s defeat has been eclipsed by the prospect of upheaval that it has brought about. As Fuentes said on the “InfoWars” panel, “This is the best thing that can happen, because it’s destroying the legitimacy of the system.” Fuentes was at the Capitol riot, though he denies going inside. On his show the next day, he called the siege “the most awe-inspiring and inspirational and incredible thing I have seen in my entire life.”\n\nAt the heap of wrecked camera gear outside the Capitol, the man in the leather jacket and sunglasses declared to the crowd, “We are at war. . . . Mobilize in your own cities, your own counties. Storm your own capitol buildings. And take down every one of these corrupt motherfuckers.” Behind him, lights glowed in the rotunda. The sky darkened. At 8 p.m., Congress reconvened and resumed certifying the election. For six hours, Americans had held democracy hostage in the name of patriotism.\n\nThe storm might be here. ♦\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nTrump was impeached for a second time on January 13th.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

And he hasn’t wasted any time making changes.\n\nThe South Africa-born entrepreneur has already dismissed chief executive Parag Agrawal, chief financial officer Ned Segal and general counsel Vijaya Gadde.\n\nHowever, according to reports, Mr Musk told staff during his visit that it was not true that he was planning on cutting up to 75% of Twitter staff after acquiring the company.\n\nIt had previously been reported that Mr Musk told investors he planned to cut around three-quarters of the firm’s 7,500 employees.\n\nParag Agrawal has been fired as CEO of Twitter (Credit: Getty)\n\nStaff, Twitter users and industry experts are waiting to see what plans Musk has for the platform.\n\nHe has previously spoken of his belief in ‘absolute free speech’ and suggested he would allow previously suspended and often controversial figures, including former US president Donald Trump, to return to the platform, which has alarmed online safety campaigners.\n\nWhat will Twitter look like under Elon Musk?\n\nThe SpaceX and Tesla boss said his reasons for acquiring Twitter were ‘because it is important to the future of civilization to have a common digital town square, where a wide range of beliefs can be debated in a healthy manner, without resorting to violence.’\n\nHowever, he has insisted the social platform won’t become a ‘hellscape’ under his watch.\n\nHe added: ‘In addition to adhering to the laws of the land, our platform must be warm and welcoming to all, where you can choose your desired experience according to your preferences, just as you can choose, for example, to see movies or play video games ranging from all ages to mature.’\n\nTwitter staff are trying to keep morale high after Musk’s takeover (Credit: Twitter)\n\nWriting in The Conversation, Erik Gordon, a Professor of Business at the University of Michigan, says Musk will look to take the company private to maximise his control over it.\n\n‘Once the shares change hands, Twitter will be Musk’s to do with as he pleases – from reopening the accounts of former President Donald Trump and Ye, the artist formally known as Kanye West, to slashing the workforce by up to 75%.\n\n‘Musk understood the physics of launching rockets and the engineering behind building an electric car, but he doesn’t have deep experience running a social media platform or in building super apps. I believe he doesn’t have a thoroughly thought-out strategy that fits Twitter’s difficult environment.\n\n‘What he will have is a huge amount of debt. Last year, Twitter owed about $51 million in interest on its debt. After going private, the estimates are that Twitter will owe at least a billion dollars annually on about $13 billion in new debt.’\n\nNed Segal, the chief financial officer of Twitter, has also been fired by Musk (Credit: Getty Images)\n\n‘In 2021, the company generated just $630 million in cash from operations. That means Musk won’t have much cash to fund a super app or any other big ideas, unless he is able to attract additional investment in the company.\n\n‘With the company in his hands, Musk can, of course, do what he likes. He can implement any free speech policy that suits his fancy. He can let Trump and Ye tweet. He can ban Tesla short sellers and anyone who questions his foreign policy initiatives. He can fire 75% of his staff in a heartbeat – something a public CEO would have a very hard time doing.’\n\nThe return of Donald Trump and ‘free speech’\n\nThe Tesla and SpaceX boss has said he believes strongly in absolute free speech, to the extent that anything that is not illegal should be allowed to stay online.\n\nAnd he has confirmed he would allow banned accounts, such as that of former US president Donald Trump, to return to help achieve Twitter’s mission to be an unfiltered ‘common digital town square’.\n\nElon Musk has indicated that Donald Trump could be reinstated on Twitter (Credits: AP)\n\nMusk has said he believes it is ‘important to the future of civilisation’ to have a space where ‘a wide range of beliefs can be debated in a healthy manner’.\n\nThis stance would be likely to face significant issues once the Online Safety Bill comes into effect in the UK.\n\nWhile the Bill has pledged to protect free speech through protections around content of democratic importance and from news publishers, it will require platforms not just to take down any illegal content but also any topics which have been designated ‘legal but harmful’, which is likely to be content linked to abuse or harassment, among other things.\n\nWith large fines and even the prospect of being banned from the UK as potential penalties, Musk is likely to have to soften his stance on absolute free speech if he wants Twitter to stay on the right side of regulators.\n\nAdvertisers too are unlikely to be happy about the possibility of their adverts appearing alongside increasingly controversial content.\n\nThe everything app\n\nA key moment in this takeover saga came when Musk confirmed he would go ahead with the deal and said buying the platform was ‘an accelerant to creating X, the everything app’.\n\nThe billionaire has spoken broadly in the past about his support for the idea of an ‘everything app’ – a single place where users can access most, if not all, of their favourite online services and utilities.\n\nMusk could use Twitter to form the basis of an ‘everything app’ (Credit: Getty)\n\nIn China, a version of the everything app idea already exists in WeChat, which began life as a messaging platform similar to WhatsApp, but has since become a mini-internet within a single app – allowing users to do everything from share social media-style posts with friends, to getting news, making mobile payments, booking restaurants and ordering taxis.\n\nNothing similar exists in the West.\n\nSome experts have questioned Musk’s ability or even desire to actually create such a service, but no-one can match the resources he has – he is the world’s wealthiest person – and he has experience in digital payments through PayPal and transport through Tesla which could help bring together different services in one place.\n\nInside the company\n\nMusk’s public sparring with Twitter and criticism of the company in the months before the takeover has not sat well with some Twitter staff, with reports of many even planning to leave once the takeover was closed over their fears about Musk’s proposed new direction for the company.\n\nMusk has been pictured inside the Twitter HQ talking to staff (Credit: Twitter)\n\nIndustry analyst Mike Proulx said earlier this month that ‘earning and retaining the trust’ of Twitter’s employees should be Musk’s ‘number one mission’.\n\n‘Twitter remains an important part of our culture regardless of the ongoing drama around this on-again, off-again, and back-on-again deal,’ he said.\n\n‘Twitter’s future is bleak without an engaged employee base and there’s a lot of repair work to be done there.’\n\nMusk’s dismissing of the senior staff has already caused alarm among some online safety campaigners, who have warned that a shift in Twitter’s policy around safety and free speech could make the platform more dangerous, while others have suggested the internal turmoil during Musk’s restructuring could make the platform more vulnerable to hackers.\n\nArrow MORE: Elon Musk confirms he has bought Twitter\n\nArrow MORE: Elon Musk enters Twitter headquarters carrying kitchen sink and changes profile to ‘Chief Twit’\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nMusk laid off thousands of Twitter employees and contractors.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Explosives experts say it was one of the biggest non-nuclear explosions of all time; even Lebanon's neighboring countries felt the strength of the blast.\n\nFollowing the explosion, the ubiquitous sound of shattered glass being swept away became a discordant anthem of Beirut's grief. Thousands of volunteers from all over Lebanon and its diaspora flooded the affected areas, armed with shovels to clear rubble and wreckage blocking the streets and offering accommodation to hundreds of thousands who'd lost their homes. For the elderly and vulnerable, they fixed broken doors and windows.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nHussein Kazoun, 28, an organic farmer and the owner of a produce delivery company, sips instant coffee, enjoying his first break since he began his volunteer shift at 7 a.m. He hasn't made money in weeks, and he doesn't know when he will be able to return to his business.\n\nBut, he says, his work as a volunteer is more important: \"Lebanese people have to help each other in the absence of a functioning state.\"\n\nKazoun is a cofounder of Nation Station — an abandoned gas station converted into a disaster relief community center. The center serves the residents of Geitawi, a neighborhood overlooking the port that was badly damaged in the blast. It is just one of many initiatives by young Lebanese citizens determined to rebuild a capital city devastated by years of official negligence.\n\nThe state, paralyzed by corruption, mismanagement and the country's economic collapse, has been conspicuously absent following the Aug. 4 blast. While in most other countries, the government would have led an emergency response, in Lebanon, volunteers and nongovernmental organizations have taken things into their own hands and are leading the way.\n\nAlthough the Lebanese Army distributed boxes of food aid last week — rice, lentils and powdered milk donated by foreign countries — many volunteers slammed the move as a one-time publicity stunt. In most cases, government critics say, soldiers and police have done little, as volunteers and nonprofit workers have rushed to aid those affected by the blast.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Nada Homsi for NPR Nada Homsi for NPR\n\nThe Lebanese state, already bankrupt and suffering from an economic meltdown, has few social safety nets for Lebanese in need.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nNation Station was established the morning after the explosion, with Kazoun distributing free produce to Geitawi's residents. Other volunteers soon joined, offering their own services. They wired electricity throughout the dilapidated gas station, installed WiFi and created shift schedules. They formed cleanup crews, home repair crews, aid distribution teams, a hot meal kitchen, and set up a free secondhand clothing area in the gas station's parking lot.\n\nThree weeks later, it remains a bustling neighborhood center, where up to 150 volunteers have created their own functioning version of Lebanon — itself a form of protest against an increasingly dystopian reality.\n\nGerard Bitar, 25, a DJ and sound engineer, is on a technical team repairing electricity in damaged homes. Eager to help after he lost his own home in the blast, he says he picked up the electrical trade \"like, two weeks ago.\" Mostly, he says, volunteering helps distract him from thinking about the explosion.\n\n\"They killed us, man,\" he says of Lebanon's politicians.\n\nConfidence in Lebanon's ruling class was already wearing thin after years of political corruption and mismanagement brought the country to economic ruin last year, plunging more than 50% of the population below the poverty line, the World Bank estimates.\n\nInflation has soared, Lebanon's middle class has slowly disappeared, businesses have shuttered and unemployment is high. Lebanon's power-holders have done little to stem the crisis or enact the reforms required for an international bailout. The political class — some of them former warlords who emerged from Lebanon's 15-year civil war as politicians — are known for ruthless power-mongering and self-preservation that have come at the expense of ordinary Lebanese.\n\nMany Lebanese see Beirut's port explosion — caused by 2,750 tons of explosive material left deteriorating in a warehouse for nearly seven years — as the culmination of decades of government negligence. Since the blast, it came to light that high-ranking politicians and government employees, including the president and former prime minister (who resigned after the explosion), had previous knowledge of the haphazardly stored explosive material but made little effort to remove it.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nA makeshift gallows of metal wreckage stands at the entrance of Nation Station, from which hangs a noose made of electrical cables — a popular symbol of Lebanese outrage against politicians. On a sweltering Wednesday afternoon, volunteers gather in the shade to rest between shifts, while others load supplies onto motorbikes headed for the homes of vulnerable people. Neighborhood residents stop by to pick up hot meals. Many come to request medicine for wounds sustained in the blast and for preexisting illnesses.\n\nAntoine Kalab, a 27-year-old graduate student, walks the streets of Geitawi, surveying homes. He was in London when the explosion took place. Like many Lebanese in the diaspora, he watched in horror as footage aired of Beirut's sky turning red, followed by a mushroom cloud that expanded to envelop half the capital.\n\nFive days later, angry and under no illusions that the Lebanese government would competently handle disaster relief, he arrived in Beirut and signed up to volunteer at Nation Station, joining a needs assessment team.\n\nWeeks after the blast, the disaster response has changed. Glass and debris have been cleared from most streets, and those who lost their homes have located temporary housing. Kalab jots down residents' needs: medicine, food, a new front door, free mental health counseling.\n\nOne resident, Mona Ass'ad Aramouneh, a retired nurse, lives with her 90-year-old diabetic mother, who cannot see or walk. The two women were in their rented apartment when the world around them exploded.\n\nMona's mother fell to the floor, the glass door of their balcony shattering over her head. Even now, she says, \"I'm still picking bits of glass out of my hair and feet.\"\n\nAramouneh managed to drag her mother out of harm's way, and, unable to carry her to the hospital (which, unbeknownst to her, had mostly been destroyed in the blast), bandaged her at home. The memory of it contorts her face. Neither she nor her mother can sleep at night, she says, and although their apartment wasn't severely damaged, the memory of the explosion has tarnished any love they had for it.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nWhen Kalab asks if any government aid has come their way, Aramouneh says: \"The government, helping? Not until catastrophe befalls them, until one of their own dies, will they realize the value of the Lebanese people, the poor people, those of us who have suffered.\"\n\nLater, on the walk back to Nation Station, Kalab says he plans to return to London. When the volunteer effort eventually fades, he says, Lebanon will hold no future for him.\n\n\"A country that requires you to die for it ... It's not a healthy country,\" he says, tearing up. Then he walks past the makeshift gallows, and back into the bustling gas station.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nLebanon declared a two-week state of emergency in Beirut following the blast.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

But they said Musk is in charge of the social media platform and has fired CEO Parag Agrawal, CFO Ned Segal and Chief Legal Counsel Vijaya Gadde. Neither person wanted to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the deal.\n\nThe departures come just hours before a deadline set by a Delaware judge to finalize the deal on Friday. She threatened to schedule a trial if no agreement was reached.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAlthough they came quickly, the major personnel moves had been widely expected and almost certainly are the first of many major changes the mercurial Tesla CEO will make.\n\nMusk privately clashed with Agrawal in April, immediately before deciding to make a bid for the company, according to text messages later revealed in court filings.\n\nAbout the same time, he used Twitter to criticize Gadde, the company's top lawyer. His tweets were followed by a wave of harassment of Gadde from other Twitter accounts. For Gadde, an 11-year Twitter employee who also heads public policy and safety, the harassment included racist and misogynistic attacks, in addition to calls for Musk to fire her. On Thursday, after she was fired, the harassing tweets lit up once again.\n\nMusk's changes will be aimed at increasing Twitter's subscriber base and revenue.\n\nIn his first big move earlier on Thursday, Musk tried to soothe leery Twitter advertisers saying that he is buying the platform to help humanity and doesn't want it to become a \"free-for-all hellscape.\"\n\nThe message appeared to be aimed at addressing concerns among advertisers — Twitter's chief source of revenue — that Musk's plans to promote free speech by cutting back on moderating content will open the floodgates to more online toxicity and drive away users.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"The reason I acquired Twitter is because it is important to the future of civilization to have a common digital town square, where a wide range of beliefs can be debated in a healthy manner, without resorting to violence,\" Musk wrote in an uncharacteristically long message for the Tesla CEO, who typically projects his thoughts in one-line tweets.\n\nHe continued: \"There is currently great danger that social media will splinter into far right wing and far left wing echo chambers that generate more hate and divide our society.\"\n\nMusk has previously expressed distaste for advertising and Twitter's dependence on it, suggesting more emphasis on other business models such as paid subscriptions that won't allow big corporations to dictate policy on how social media operates. But on Thursday, he assured advertisers he wants Twitter to be \"the most respected advertising platform in the world.\"\n\nThe note is a shift from Musk's position that Twitter is unfairly infringing on free speech rights by blocking misinformation or graphic content, said Pinar Yildirim, associate professor of marketing at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.\n\nBut it's also a realization that having no content moderation is bad for business, putting Twitter at risk of losing advertisers and subscribers, she said.\n\n\"You do not want a place where consumers just simply are bombarded with things they do not want to hear about, and the platform takes no responsibility,\" Yildirim said.\n\nMusk said Twitter should be \"warm and welcoming to all\" and enable users to choose the experience they want to have.\n\nFriday's deadline to close the deal was ordered by the Delaware Chancery Court in early October. It is the latest step in a battle that began in April with Musk signing a deal to acquire Twitter, then tried to back out of it, leading Twitter to sue the Tesla CEO to force him to go through with the acquisition. If the two sides don't meet Friday's deadline, the next step could be a November trial that could lead to a judge forcing Musk to complete the deal.\n\nBut Musk has been signaling that the deal is going through. He strolled into the company's San Francisco headquarters Wednesday carrying a porcelain sink, changed his Twitter profile to \"Chief Twit,\" and tweeted \"Entering Twitter HQ — let that sink in!\"\n\nAnd overnight the New York Stock Exchange notified investors that it will suspend trading in shares of Twitter before the opening bell Friday in anticipation of the company going private under Musk.\n\nMusk is expected to speak to Twitter employees directly Friday if the deal is finalized, according to an internal memo cited in several media outlets. Despite internal confusion and low morale tied to fears of layoffs or a dismantling of the company's culture and operations, Twitter leaders this week have at least outwardly welcomed Musk's arrival and messaging.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nTop sales executive Sarah Personette, the company's chief customer officer, said she had a \"great discussion\" with Musk on Wednesday and appeared to endorse his Thursday message to advertisers.\n\n\"Our continued commitment to brand safety for advertisers remains unchanged,\" Personette tweeted Thursday. \"Looking forward to the future!\"\n\nMusk's apparent enthusiasm about visiting Twitter headquarters this week stood in sharp contrast to one of his earlier suggestions: The building should be turned into a homeless shelter because so few employees actually worked there.\n\nThe Washington Post reported last week that Musk told prospective investors that he plans to cut three quarters of Twitter's 7,500 workers when he becomes owner of the company. The newspaper cited documents and unnamed sources familiar with the deliberation.\n\nMusk has spent months deriding Twitter's \"spam bots\" and making sometimes contradictory pronouncements about Twitter's problems and how to fix them. But he has shared few concrete details about his plans for the social media platform.\n\nThursday's note to advertisers shows a newfound emphasis on advertising revenue, especially a need for Twitter to provide more \"relevant ads\" — which typically means targeted ads that rely on collecting and analyzing users' personal information.\n\nYildirim said that, unlike Facebook, Twitter has not been good at targeting advertising to what users want to see. Musk's message suggests he wants to fix that, she said.\n\nInsider Intelligence principal analyst Jasmine Enberg said Musk has good reason to avoid a massive shakeup of Twitter's ad business because Twitter's revenues have taken a beating from the weakening economy, months of uncertainty surrounding Musk's proposed takeover, changing consumer behaviors and the fact that \"there's no other revenue source waiting in the wings.\"\n\n\"Even slightly loosening content moderation on the platform is sure to spook advertisers, many of whom already find Twitter's brand safety tools to be lacking compared with other social platforms,\" Enberg said.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nOn December 20, Musk confirmed he will step down as CEO upon finding a replacement and will manage software/servers teams.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA. Musk suspended accounts of prominent journalists.\nB. Elon Musk completed his $44 billion takeover of Twitter.\nC.

There was only one firearm-related death in all of 2021. Since 2017, there have been 14 gun-related deaths, a remarkably low figure for a country of 125 million people.\n\nExpressing a common reaction, Erika Inoue, a 25-year-old designer in Tokyo, said the gun violence was hard to process.\n\n“The shooting part is confusing,” she said. “There are guns? In Japan?”\n\nJapan’s firearms law states that, in principle, guns are not permitted in the country. There are exceptions for guns used in hunting, but the process of getting a license is time-consuming and expensive, so very few people go through the hassle.\n\nA person must pass 12 steps before purchasing a firearm, starting with a gun-safety class and then passing a written exam administered three times a year. A doctor must sign off on the gun buyer’s physical and mental health. Other steps include an extensive background check and a police inspection of the gun safe and ammunition locker required for storing firearms and bullets.\n\nImage A security officer apprehending the suspect in the shooting of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Friday.

The Asahi Shimbun, via Getty Images\n\nThe shooting was all the more shocking because before Friday, even the idea of a political murder seemed like a relic of a long-gone era.\n\nTempers rarely run high in Japan’s famously sedate politics. Parliamentary debates usually don’t move beyond cat calls and faux outrage and even the ultra-right-wing groups that regularly prowl city streets in black vans, blaring political propaganda, are viewed as more of a nuisance than a threat to public safety.\n\nPolice protection at political events is light, and during campaign season, voters have plenty of opportunities to interact with the country’s top leaders. Videos showed Friday’s suspected shooter walking unobstructed in proximity of the former prime minister and firing a handmade gun.\n\nLocal Japanese police said the handmade gun used in the shooting was more than a foot long and eight inches in height. They also said they seized several handmade guns in a search of the suspect’s home.\n\nUnlike the United States, where gun rights are a constant topic of debate, firearms are rarely discussed in Japanese political circles. Mass killings — in the rare instances when they occur — usually do not involve guns. Instead, perpetrators resort to arson or stabbings.\n\nIn recent weeks, Japanese media watched the spate of mass shootings in the United States with a mix of disbelief and confusion. After the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, The Asahi Shimbun, Japan’s second-largest newspaper by circulation, published an editorial calling the United States “a gun society” and said that another tragedy had turned a classroom into a “gun massacre zone.”\n\nImage Police investigating the site where a knife-wielding man killed a police officer, then used the officer’s gun to fatally shoot a security guard, in Toyama prefecture in 2018. Credit... Jiji Press/via Agence France-Presse — Getty Images\n\nToyo Keizai, a prominent weekly business magazine and website, published an article last year after the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol asking: “Why is ‘Gun Ownership’ a Non-Negotiable Right in the U.S.?”\n\n“It is difficult for Japanese to understand why gun ownership continues in the U.S. even with such a high number of victims,” journalist Keiko Tsuyama said in the article.\n\nMost Japanese people almost never encounter guns in day-to-day life even though police officers carry firearms. And until Mr. Abe’s shooting, Japan had almost no experience with the emotional and political aftermath of gun violence — something that has become a familiar ritual in the United States.\n\nIn 2021, there were 10 shootings in Japan that contributed to death, injury or property damage, according to the National Police Agency. Of those gun-related episodes, one person was killed and four others were injured. The figures do not include accidents or suicides.\n\nMost of the roughly 192,000 licensed firearms in the country are shotguns and hunting rifles. By comparison, in the United States, where most firearms are not registered, the number of guns in civilian hands is by some estimates close to 400 million.\n\nPolitical assassinations were a regular feature of Japan’s turbulent politics in the years leading up to World War II. But since then, only a handful of politicians have been murdered — and most without the use of guns.\n\nThe last killing of a national-level political figure was in 1960, when a 17-year-old extreme nationalist stabbed to death the leader of Japan’s Socialist Party, Inejiro Asanuma.\n\nImage The last assassination of a national political figure in Japan: A 17-year-old used a sword to kill Inejiro Asanuma, leader of the Socialist Party, on a Tokyo stage in 1960.

In 2007, Kazunaga Ito, the mayor of Nagasaki, was shot to death by a gang member.\n\nJournalists have also occasionally been targets. In 1987, a reporter for the left-leaning Asahi Shimbun was murdered, in an incident linked to right-wing anti-Korean groups.\n\nProtesters have sometimes expressed their grievances by taking their own lives, hoping to draw public sympathy to their causes. Most famously, the novelist Yukio Mishima killed himself by disembowelment in 1970, after leading a small group of right-wing militants in a failed coup.\n\nGerald L. Curtis, a professor emeritus of political science and expert in Japanese politics at Columbia University, said that the deadly attack on Mr. Abe would reverberate through Japan’s politics.\n\n“It no doubt will shake up the Japanese terribly and will reinforce the view that Japan is no longer the safe, peaceful country it has been since the end of World War II and has to change to deal with the new frightening realities it faces,” he said in an email.\n\n“The question is how Japan’s political leaders respond.”\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nVideos of the assassination circulated on social media.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA. Shinzo Abe became the youngest prime minister in postwar Japan in 2006.\nB. Shinzo Abe visited Jerusalem in 2018.\nC. A man fired twice at Shinzo Abe.\nD.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert at causal reasoning."}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n### CONTEXT\n[Doc 1]\nTitle: Are hazard reduction burns effective in managing bushfires? The answer is complicated\nContent: During one of the most severe droughts in Australia's recent history, early-season and deadly bushfires have raged for weeks across parts of NSW and Queensland.\n\nThe effects of climate change are being blamed for having worsened conditions, while some politicians from the fire-ravaged states have criticised government policies and planning, \"green\" laws and a lack of hazard reduction burns.\n\nNationals MP Barnaby Joyce pointed to three major \"issues\" that he said needed to be addressed: access to the fires, central watering points, and a lack of hazard reduction burns. The latter he blamed largely on current conservation laws.\n\nSpeaking on Sky News, he said: \"One [issue] is a lack of controlled burns — fire reduction burns … that policy needs to be changed so we can get those controlled burns.\"\n\nSimilarly, Queenslander and One Nation Senator Pauline Hanson accused the Greens and Labor Party of restricting fire-reduction burns.\n\n## Key points:\n\n- Hazard reduction burns are highly dependent on weather conditions — some areas go from wet to dry too rapidly to safely conduct burns.\n- Research has shown that during catastrophic fire conditions, hazard reduction burns do little to mitigate the intensity and spread of a fire.\n- Hazard reduction burns should not be confused with backburning, which is a last resort burn during a fire to try and contain it.\n\n\"They've actually shut down the national parks, where you can't actually even clear the fuel on the floor,\" she claimed.\n\n\"…They won't allow farmers to actually clean up their own properties.\"\n\nNSW Deputy Premier John Barilaro also pointed the finger at the Greens and said: \"We've got to do better and I know that we don't do enough hazard reduction … because of the ideological position [of] the Greens.\"\n\nThat same day, he widened his attack in Parliament: \"The truth of the matter is we still live with [former Labor premier] Bob Carr's legacy: lock up the forest and let it burn. That is Bob Carr's legacy for this state. This is the truth.\"\n\nFederal Resources Minister Matthew Canavan, as recently as last week, referred to the \"bogey man of climate change\" which he said was being used to distract from the failure of the states to manage fire risks.\n\n\"The Queensland Government taking powers off farmers, taking their rights off them to be able to manage their own land, put in fire breaks, do cool burns, and that has exposed us to much much higher risk than we should,\" he said.\n\nSo, how effective are hazard reduction burns and how are they managed?\n\nRMIT ABC Fact Check considers the facts.\n\n## What can affect the behaviour of fires?\n\nFire behaviour refers to a variety of factors including the manner in which a fire burns, the speed at which it spreads, the amount of heat it gives off and the extent of vegetation it consumes.\n\nThe way a fire behaves and its severity is dependent on several elements, but can be narrowed down to three essentials: weather, fuel and topography.\n\nThe volume of fuel, or \"surface fuel\", in a fire's path — such as shrubbery, bark, dry leaves, twigs and so forth — is often the only component of fire behaviour that can be directly modified by people.\n\nThe rate at which organic materials burns is directly related to its moisture content; the drier the fuel, the more fiercely it burns and the more intense the fire.\n\nThe moisture of a particular fuel load depends not only on the type of vegetation, but also the humidity and temperature of its surroundings.\n\nEucalyptus forests and grasslands are typically drier fuels that burn hot and fast, while rain forests and irrigated crops burn slower and can potentially slow the pace of a fire.\n\n## What methods are used to reduce fire hazards?\n\nIn a bid to reduce the intensity of unplanned fires, authorities carry out measures to \"treat\" the fuel and reduce the amount that is available to feed a fire.\n\n\"They are treating fuel to change its structure and to typically reduce the amount of fuel or fuel load,\" Ross Bradstock, as senior professor at Wollongong University's Centre for Environmental Risk Management of Bushfires, told Fact Check.\n\nThis fuel treating process is called hazard reduction.\n\nHazard reduction methods include the intentional burning of surface fuel loads, but other practical and \"mechanical\" methods are also deployed.\n\nThe latter include activities such as \"thinning\" bushland (by cutting down trees), clearing, slashing or mulching ground litter, ploughing fields, cleaning guttering on houses and other buildings, and through fire-resistant garden design and maintenance.\n\n## Hazard reduction burns\n\nBushfire management is divided into two categories: firefighting and fire prevention.\n\nPlanned and purposeful burning of excess ground litter and fuel hazards in a specific area is known by many names — a \"hazard reduction burn\", \"controlled burn\" or \"prescribed burning\" to name a few.\n\nThese types of burns are widely used in fire prevention and are carried out in winter or generally outside the fire season when conditions are less volatile.\n\nThey require careful consideration and planning to achieve maximum results and to minimise potential dangers to health and wildlife, and to avoid causing accidental bushfires.\n\nPrescribed burns should not be confused with \"back burning\", a fire-fighting tool.\n\nAs explained by bushfire expert and University of Tasmania professor David Bowman in The Conversation, back burning is \"a last-resort measure\" to stop a progressing bushfire from spreading to specific areas.\n\n\"The difference between fuel-reduction burning and back burning is effectively the same as the difference between elective and emergency surgery,\" Bowman wrote.\n\n\"Back burning … works by setting fires from containment lines, such as established fire breaks or hastily contrasted ones made with a bulldozer or cut by hand.\"\n\n## Who is responsible?\n\nBushfire management activities in Australia are conducted by state and territory governments and their relevant statutory authorities such as fire emergency services, including professional and volunteer firefighters, as well as by municipal councils and individual property owners.\n\nAt a federal level, bushfire management is regulated by the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act).\n\nA national policy fact sheet outlines the circumstances where fire prevention activities require federal environmental approval.\n\nActivities that are not covered by the national law include those approved or authorised under federal or state/territory laws before July 2000 (when the legislation took effect), as well as continued lawful land uses of the sort that were occurring before July 2000 (such as maintaining access to existing tracks and fire breaks, roadside weed control, and routine controlled burns of the type that occurred in the past).\n\nActivities that require ministerial approval, according to the act, are those affecting nationally threatened species and their habitats, as well as Commonwealth land.\n\nThese include, for example, the construction of substantial new fire breaks, access roads or tracks on a significant scale in habitat for national threatened species; one-off fuel burns in remnant forest that is important habitat for nationally threatened species and had not been subject previously to a burning regime; and, proposed new burning regimes in world heritage sites among others.\n\n## Queensland framework and operation\n\nFact Check contacted the Queensland Fire and Emergency Services (QFES) and the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Services for information about the legal framework, as well as the processes and procedures, governing prescribed burning in that state.\n\nNumerous agencies and government departments are responsible for planning, overseeing and conducting hazard reduction on both state-managed and private land.\n\nQueensland fire management groups, including volunteer fire brigades, also participate in the yearly operation Cool Burn — a hazard reduction coordinating effort organised by QFES which generally operates from April 1 to August 31.\n\nThe goal of Cool Burn is to put in place a plan for hazard reduction and other mitigating activities across the landscape with a focus on protecting the community, and public and privately owned assets, as well as identifying areas at high risk of a fire, such as enclosed townships.\n\nLoading...QFES Superintendent James Haig told Fact Check that authorisation under Queensland's Fire and Emergencies Act was necessary to conduct hazard reduction burns on private and state-managed lands. This would take the form of either a notification (in cases such as burning assignments for the sugarcane industry), or as a permit obtained from local fire wardens.\n\n\"We have a large number of fire wardens, many of whom are volunteers, so they come from the community and they are aware of the local conditions,\" Mr Haig said.\n\nAccording to QFES records, approximately 28,000 permits a year were issued for controlled fires since 2015.\n\n\"In 2019, QFES and its partners completed 229 priority mitigation activities to reduce bushfire risk at high-risk sites,\" it said in a statement sent to Fact Check.\n\n\"This includes 108 of 175 planned hazard reduction burns, 83 targeted education activities and 38 fire line upgrades.\"\n\nHowever, such activities were \"highly dependent\" on weather conditions, it added, with not all planned 2019 burns able to be completed.\n\n\"In some areas, it rapidly became too dry to burn safely,\" the QFES statement continued.\n\n\"In other areas, it was too wet too early on and dried out rapidly, leaving a short window of opportunity to safely conduct mitigation activities.\"\n\nMr Haig elaborated: \"The most common reason for a permit not being granted would be because the local conditions were too dry; that it was difficult to conduct safely and with the appropriate outcome.\"\n\nHe added that if moisture levels in the soil were too low, then farmers (especially graziers) often would want to hold onto the grass they had, so there were fewer applications for fire permits.\n\nQueensland Parks and Wildlife Service, which manages primarily native forests and state-owned land, is exempt from obtaining a \"permit to light fire\".\n\nIt has its own procedures and burn targets, and collaborates with the QFES on initiatives such as operation Cool Burn.\n\n\"From 1 January [2019] to date, QPWS conducted 291 planned burns over 1,443,882 hectares — which is the largest area covered in the last six years,\" a statement provided to Fact Check said.\n\n\"QPWS's annual target for Protection Zones burns is 90 per cent (14,884 hectares). In 2018-19, QPWS achieved 118 per cent of this target.\"\n\n## NSW framework and operation\n\nIn NSW, the National Parks and Wildlife Service works with the NSW Rural Fire Service, Fire and Rescue NSW, Forestry Corporation and Sydney Catchment Authority to carry out hazard reduction burns and other hazard reduction activities such as mowing and building firebreaks.\n\nAccording to the NSW Department of Environment, hazard reduction efforts in NSW have increased under the Enhanced Bushfire Management Program (EBMP), which came into effect in 2011.\n\nThe statewide program began with a five-year commitment to treat 135,000 hectares of bushland (on average) each year. In 2017, the NSW Government extended the program to 2022.\n\nThe NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service operates under the Rural Fires Act 1997 and under the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974.\n\nOver the last eight years, according to its website, the NPWS carried out hazard reduction burns in NSW parks and reserves covering more than 680,000 hectares — more than double that of the previous five-year period.\n\n\"NPWS has undertaken 80 per cent of the total hazard reduction burning effort recorded in NSW, despite managing less than 9 per cent of the state,\" its website states.\n\n## Conducting planned burns\n\nThe University of Wollongong's Professor Bradstock, who also heads the NSW Bushfire Risk Management Research Hub, told Fact Check: \"In Australia, typically we do a lot of prescribed burning, perhaps more so than many other countries, but we are doing it with the intention of reducing the intensity of subsequent wildfires — unplanned fires — to a level where they are potentially controllable using suppression forces.\"\n\nThe threshold of safe and effective fire suppression is calculated by the McArthur Forest Fire Danger Meter, which Fact Check has looked at previously.\n\nUsing measurements of air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and fuel conditions, combined with a formula to account for the effect of drought, the meter creates the Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI).\n\nAn index of 1 means that a fire will not burn, or will burn so slowly that control presents little difficulty, while anything above 100 is considered a catastrophic rating (\"code red\" in Victoria).\n\nHowever, Professor Bradstock noted that the McArthur Meter and the FFDI were developed empirically through observations of small fires burning under mild conditions in the 1960s, and did not necessarily perform well in the extreme fire conditions prevailing in the current NSW bushfires.\n\n\"[W]e know that the McArthur FFD models underpredict the rate of spread and intensity under high forest fire danger index conditions; in other words, they don't fully capture all the things that are going on when it's really hot, really windy and the humidity is very low,\" he told Fact Check.\n\n## Fire behaviour under extreme and catastrophic conditions\n\nExperts emphasised that in extreme and catastrophic fire conditions, the surface fuel available for burning makes next to no difference to the level of a fire's intensity.\n\nUniversity of Melbourne associate professor Trent Penman, who studies bushfire behaviour,told Fact Check: \"Prescribed burning effectiveness decreases with [increasing] FFDI; when you exceed an FFDI of about 50, you switch from fuel-dominated to a weather-dominated fire.\n\n\"At this point, while fuel has a small effect, it is overwhelmed by the weather.\"\n\nProfessor Bradstock agreed, pointing to the example of Victoria's Black Saturday bushfires in 2009 that claimed the lives of 173 people.\n\nHis team studied the aftermath of the fires which were associated with an FFDI of well above 100.\n\nThey found that even in the areas where fuel had been treated with planned burns less than five years prior, there was no measurable effect on the intensity of the fires.\n\n\"At a level where we would have expected the fire intensity to be reduced to suppressible levels, we essentially found no effect,\" he told Fact Check.\n\n\"It's almost like a turbo-charging effect, when you have such incredibly high temperatures and very high winds that you only need a negligible amount of fuel to produce a fire intensity that is not suppressible.\"\n\nThe University of Tasmania's Professor Bowman said that in catastrophic conditions, such as those prevailing in the current Queensland and NSW bushfires, all \"organic matter is going to burn\".\n\n\"There's so much heat and strong winds that the fire is able to travel across landscapes regardless of whether they've been burnt previously. It doesn't affect the [fire] behaviour.\"\n\nProfessor Bowman described embers rushing ahead of the fire front, passing over cleared areas to find available fuel like a \"heat gun blasting sparks at incredibly high speed\".\n\n\"It's a wind-driven phenomenon,\" he said.\n\n\"[E]ven if you can treat everything at a maximum level, it's still not going to give you the benefit under catastrophic fire weather conditions.\"\n\nProfessor Bradstock likened the effect of prescribed burns on fire intensity to a sliding scale.\n\n\"The window of effectiveness essentially narrows down to a point where it essentially disappears,\" he told Fact Check.\n\n## Some vegetation types cannot be treated with prescribed burning\n\nExperts also explained that some fuel types, particularly wet forest vegetation, were not treatable in the cooler months of the year, when prescribed burns can be safely carried out.\n\n\"Some fuel types are simply not dry enough to burn in the time, when it is safe to do so,\" Professor Penman said. \"These include rainforests and wet forests.\"\n\nHe gave the example of a campfire: \"[I]f you put green leaves on it to get it started; they won't work. There's too much moisture there to get the fire started. You can put green leaves on, once the fire is going and they'll burn, but if the fuel is too wet, the fire won't start in the first place.\"\n\nHowever, these vegetation types would still burn under catastrophic conditions.\n\nAs Professor Bradstock explained, parts of the Victorian and NSW landscapes, such as the wet forests or alpine areas, were not treatable under normal conditions.\n\n\"It's a waste of time because they are usually too wet to burn.\n\n\"Because things are so critically dry at the moment, what typically would never burn, well, now it is burning,\" he said.\n\nAnd Professor Bowman agreed that different fuel types affected fire intensity differently, but in catastrophic conditions, \"the variability and fuel load becomes irrelevant\".\n\n## How effective are prescribed burns?\n\nA plethora of scientific papers describe hazard reduction burns as the easiest and most effective tool of bushfire management — more effective than slashing, weeding, herbicide use and so forth.\n\nProfessor Bradstock told Fact Check this was because of its wide reach and comparatively low cost.\n\n\"You can treat [through burning] relatively large areas with costs around $100 a hectare in terms of operational costs; so you might be able to burn out 2000 hectares in a day or two, relatively cheaply,\" he said.\n\n\"If you were to go in there and try and mechanically treat that, you wouldn't be able to do it.\"\n\nBurning has been found to be even more effective in areas adjacent to houses or within a so-called Bushland Urban Interface Zone, also known as the wildland-urban interface, despite the higher cost, which can range from $1000 to $10,000 per hectare.\n\n\"[E]ven then, it's still probably cheaper than mechanical work,\" Professor Bradstock told Fact Check.\n\nA 2018 research article published by the CSIRO indicated that \"intensifying prescribed burning treatments in public land in the [wild-urban interface] achieves a greater reduction in damages compared with applying the majority of the treatments in rural areas.\n\n\"However, prescribed burning in the WUI is significantly more expensive and, despite additional benefits gained from this strategy, in most cases it is not the most economically efficient strategy.\"\n\nBut research has also found that prescribed burning as a bushfire management tool is not a panacea.\n\nA 2015 research paper exploring variations in the effectiveness of prescribed burns in south-eastern Australia found that the inconsistency was due to biogeographical variation in fuel types, climatic influences and fire regimes.\n\n\"Prescribed burning solutions that are effective in one particular region may not be effective elsewhere unless there is strong similarity in vegetation types, fire weather, fuel accumulation and ignition rates.\n\n\"The most efficient use of prescribed fire is applying it to the immediate proximity of assets, where a resultant reduction in fire intensity can be of immediate benefit in terms of impacts on structures and ease of suppression.\"\n\nAs an example of the futility of some prescribed burns, Dr Penman pointed to the forest around Port Macquarie in northern NSW, which has been widely studied and found to have fuel vegetation that regenerates every three to five years.\n\n\"Any burn you undertake in those areas has a longevity of about three to five years,\" he said.\n\n\"You have to be burning a huge amount before you are actually reducing the risk at all.\"\n\nIn other areas where fuels accumulated more slowly, planned burns had a greater impact, he added.\n\n\"But it's never going to stop wildfires.\"\n\n## What does the future of bushfire management look like?\n\nProfessor Bradstock told Fact Check that scientists and agencies with more advanced and up-to-date modeling capabilities would need to better choose treatment areas with maximum cost effectiveness.\n\n\"We are going to have to get smarter about it,\" he told Fact Check.\n\n\"We are going to learn a lot from the current fire season.\n\n\"I know, anecdotally, there has been major property damage done in NSW in areas that have been recently treated.\"\n\nProfessor Penman told Fact Check that \"chasing the hectares\" in prescribed-burn targets was misguided.\n\nRather, states and statutory authorities were using a combination of hectares treated and risk approach in their bushfire management.\n\n\"What you're really trying to achieve is [to] reduce the risk to assets that you have of value in the landscape, so that might be ecological assets like at-risk forest types. It may be around cultural sites, and it might be Indigenous or European sites and then other things like power lines, water supply catchments, and then, of course, around houses,\" he said.\n\n\"[N]one of the agencies just invest entirely in prescribed burning or something else. They have a mixture of what they do.\n\n\"It should never be a debate about, 'Does one thing do everything for us', because everybody knows that's not the case. It's about getting that balance right, across the different approaches.\n\n\"So it's quite a challenging landscape to be working in, and you put that in the context of a changing climate and it becomes even harder.\"\n\n## Barnaby Joyce elaborates\n\nWhen invited to expand on his media statements regarding prescribed burns and bushfire preparation, Nationals MP Mr Joyce sent Fact Check a list of grievances which focused on higher burn targets, a lack of dams and the imposition of bushfire permits, and pointed to a number of policies that in his view needed to be amended to allow better bushfire management.\n\nThese included the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974, and land clearing laws (including the Native Vegetation Act 2003, the Local Land Services Act 2013 and the Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016.\n\nMr Joyce nominated the former, saying \"the annual targets need to be dramatically increased\" to allow for more hazard reduction burns.\n\nHe also pointed to the fact that Australia's National Parks and areas within state forests did not permit grazing, which \"obviously affects fuel loads\".\n\nAnd he suggested that fire permit requirements (for firebreak provisions and mandatory monitoring throughout a burn), as well as the penalties for non-compliance, were stopping some farmers from conducting these all-important activities.\n\nHowever, the bushfire experts Fact Check spoke to dismissed Mr Joyce's claims, saying they failed to address key issues.\n\nThey countered that reasonable safeguards ensuring landholders and neighbours were kept safe during prescribed burns were an important component of current fire management practices.\n\n\"There is a deliberate misinterpretation of the ecological thresholds and there is still the inherent assumption that a fuel reduction burn will reduce wildfires,\" said Melbourne University's Professor Penman.\n\nProfessor Bradstock said: \"Prescribed burning is constrained by budgets, resources and weather conditions. Pretty simple really: essentially, what we pay for is what we get.\"\n\n**Principal researcher: Christina Arampatzi**\n\n## Sources\n\n- Barnaby Joyce, Sky News Interview, news.com.au, November 12, 2019\n- Pauline Hanson, Sky News Interview, November 11, 2019\n- John Barilaro, 2GB.com radio interview, November 13, 2019\n- Parliament of NSW, Legislative Assembly Hansard, November 13, 2019\n- Matt Canavan, Radio National Interview, December 12, 2019\n- Fire behaviour: Government of Western Australia\n- Fire behaviour: Government of South Australia\n- Bushfire Hazards, NSW Rural Fire Service, Government of NSW\n- Research Paper: Bushfire Hazard Reduction: the sword of the shield?, University of Wollongong, 2013\n- The Conversation: Explainer: back burning and fuel reduction, August 8, 2014\n- Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999\n- Australian Government: Bushfire management and national environment law (fact sheet)\n- NSW Government: Enhanced Bushfire Management Program (website)\n- NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service: Hazard Reduction Program (website)\n- RMIT ABC Fact Check: Were Queensland fire danger indices historically high for early September?\n- Land Management Practices Associated with House Loss in Wildfires, January 2012\n- Research Paper: The efficacy of fuel treatment in mitigating property loss during wildfires: insights from the analysis of the severity of the catastrophic fires in 2009 in Victoria, Australia, University of Wollongong, 2012\n- Research Paper: Reducing wildfire risk to urban developments: Simulation of cost-effective fuel treatment solutions in south eastern Australia, 2013\n- Research Paper: Where to prescribe burn: the costs and benefits of prescribed burning close to houses, CSIRO Publishing 2019\n- Research Paper: Biogeographical variation in the potential effectiveness of prescribed fire in south‐eastern Australia, 2015\n- Research Article: Land Management Practices Associated with House Loss in Wildfires\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nThe fires destroyed more than 1,400 homes.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

The command threatened violators will be arrested without warrant.\n\nLeaders of the ruling conservative People Power Party and the main liberal opposition Democratic Party both immediately decried Yoon's action as unconstitutional and illegal.\n\nTwo and a half hours after the announcement, 190 lawmakers gathered at the National Assembly amid armed soldiers swarming onto the legislature's premises. The lawmakers, including 18 from Yoon's party, annulled martial law in a unanimous vote.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in South Korea issued an alert, advising U.S. citizens to stay away from protests or other large gatherings, which could escalate into violence. The U.K. also made a similar travel advisory.\n\n\n\n\"I felt like I was Alice in Wonderland\"\n\nIt was the first time martial law was imposed in South Korea since the 1980s. But in the early decades of the country's modern history, dictators and military juntas enforced martial law to squash political rivals and pro-democracy movements, often citing unsubstantiated threats from North Korea as the reason.\n\n\"And the South Korean people, they know their history as well,\" says Benjamin Engel, a visiting political science professor at Dankook University outside Seoul. \"And they're not going to accept a return of military rule or martial law. And that was clear from the get-go.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nOver the chaotic and historic night, a growing crowd of protesters gathered outside the main gate of the parliament. Inside the compound, protesters and parliament staffers tried to block soldiers from entering the main meeting hall. Some built barricades with furniture.\n\nThe National Assembly's Secretary General Kim Min-ki said in a briefing that nearly 300 martial law troops stormed the parliament, flying in military helicopters or climbing over fences. Some smashed windows to enter the main building, he said. Kim announced that members of the defense ministry and the police will now be prohibited from entering the parliament, to protect the institution's functions and lawmakers' safety.\n\ntoggle caption Jung Yeon-Je/AFP via Getty Images\n\nIn recent years, the main opposition Democratic Party has warned against the possibility that a conservative government can declare martial law to defuse a political crisis. Under President Park Geun-hye, daughter of the dictator Park Chung Hee, the military prepared a detailed plan for martial law amid nationwide protests over her corruption allegations that eventually led to her impeachment in 2017.\n\nDP's leader Lee Jae-myung openly raised a suspicion as recently as in September. Yoon's office brushed it off as \"irresponsible\" and \"brainwashing propaganda.\"\n\nNevertheless, after his suspicion became a reality, Lee expressed disbelief. \"I felt like I was Alice in Wonderland, like I was in some cartoon,\" Lee said at a rally Wednesday afternoon. \"This country – the 10th biggest economy in the world, a cultural powerhouse and an aspiring 5th biggest military power – was backpedaling to an outdated country.\"\n\nLee said the Yoon administration resorted to physical force, cornered by a looming economic, security and political crisis.\n\n\n\nIntentions of martial-law declaration unclear\n\nYoon Suk Yeol is a former chief prosecutor who won the presidency as a political rookie in 2022 with a paper-thin margin.\n\nHe has struggled throughout his term with scandals involving him and his wife. His approval rating has dropped to 20% or below in recent weeks as allegations of Yoon and his wife Kim Keon-hee's involvement in an influence-peddling scandal emerged.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe DP has been pressuring Yoon over first lady Kim's acceptance of a luxury bag, alleged stock price manipulation, involvement in state affairs and other allegations. The opposition has also questioned Yoon's role in the alleged cover-up of a Marine's death last year and in the controversial relocation of the presidential office and residence.\n\nYoon has mostly denied or dismissed these accusations as political attacks and antagonized the opposition-led parliament, frequently blocking bills with veto power.\n\nEarlier this week, his government again clashed with the parliament, as the DP slashed large portions of Yoon's budget proposal for the next year.\n\nIt remains unclear what President Yoon expected to achieve with the martial law declaration.\n\nDankook University's Benjamin Engel says, \"There's no other real way to look at it except for a self-coup trying to extend his power\" and \"push through policies without any sort of negotiations or compromise with the opposition party.\"\n\ntoggle caption Chung Sung-Jun/Getty Images\n\nPresident Yoon's future and legacy in doubt\n\nThe future of Yoon and his government appears grim. Yoon's senior aides and defense minister offered to resign. The DP is accusing the president, the defense minister and the interior minister for charges of insurrection.\n\nThe Korean Won and stock prices experienced large fluctuations amid uncertainties. Diplomatic and military schedules are being delayed, including a scheduled visit by the Swedish prime minister and a key nuclear deterrence meeting and exercise with the U.S.\n\nIn a post on X on Wednesday afternoon, the U.S. Embassy in Seoul said, \"The U.S. believes President Yoon's announcement to end martial law is a crucial step.\" The message stopped short of condemning martial law declaration.\n\nThe White House said it's relieved. But the politics professor Engel says Yoon's disruption of democratic system \"throws egg on the face of their whole trilateral cooperation efforts with the U.S., South Korea and Japan.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nYoon has envisioned South Korea as a \"global pivotal state\" that promotes liberal democratic order and pursued \"value-based diplomacy\" with like-minded democracies.\n\n\"Yoon's legacy is gone,\" says Engel.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nYoon's senior aides and defense minister offered to resign.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Kim Hong-Ji/Reuters\n\nMeanwhile, thousands of the president’s supporters gathered in downtown Seoul, with many waving US and South Korean flags, chanting slogans and holding up signs in support of the embattled Yoon.\n\nYoon, who has been immediately suspended of his powers, now awaits a ruling by the Constitutional Court – one of the country’s highest courts – to confirm his fate, which can take up to six months.\n\nActing chief justice of the Constitutional Court, Moon Hyung-bae, said in a statement Saturday that a meeting will take place on Monday to discuss the case schedule, adding that the process will be conducted “swiftly and fairly.”\n\nIf confirmed, he will become the second South Korean president to be thrown out of office by impeachment after Park Geun-hye, the country’s first female leader.\n\nThe now acting president, Han Duck-soo, also faces his own political problems and is being investigated over his role in the martial law decision, adding to the political uncertainty in the weeks ahead.\n\nA former prosecutor and conservative firebrand, Yoon has had a difficult two years in office, mired in low approval ratings and political scandals involving his wife and political appointments.\n\nPark Chan-dae, floor leader of the Democratic Party, speaks during the plenary session for the impeachment vote at the National Assembly in Seoul on December 14 Woohae Cho/Pool/AFP/Getty Images\n\nSince he took office in 2022 he has also faced political gridlock with an opposition-majority parliament – which prevented from moving forward on legislation to cut taxes and ease business regulations, as his main rivals in the Democratic Party used the legislature to impeach key cabinet members and hold up a budget bill.\n\nHis administration cracked down what he referred to as “fake news” with police and prosecutors raiding multiple media outlets, including MBC and JTBC, as well as the homes of journalists.\n\nYoon argued that his frustration with the political deadlock drove him to take a bold power move, surprising not only members of his own party but also many military leaders.\n\nPolice raids and treason investigations\n\nIn his late-night address declaring martial law, Yoon accused the opposition of “anti-state” activities and being in cahoots with North Korea, without providing evidence – a charge his opponents have strenuously denied. He also portrayed his act as the only way to break the political deadlock in parliament.\n\nBut it was met with shock and anger across the country, which remains deeply scarred by the brutality of martial law imposed during decades of military dictatorship before it transitioned into hard-won democracy in the 1980s.\n\nDramatic scenes from that night showed security forces breaking through windows in the National Assembly to try and prevent lawmakers from gathering, and protesters confronting riot police.\n\nSoldiers try to enter the National Assembly building in Seoul on December 4, after Yoon's declaration of martial law. Jung Yeon-je/AFP/Getty Images\n\nSince then, pressure on the president has grown, with police, parliament, prosecutors and the anti-corruption body launching separate investigations into Yoon on treason allegations. On Tuesday, lawmakers approved a special counsel to investigate whether Yoon committed insurrection and abused his power by issuing martial law.\n\nThe following day, South Korean police raided the presidential office, a presidential security official confirmed to CNN. Yoon has also been barred from leaving the country.\n\nLast week, South Korean prosecutors detained former defense minister Kim Yong-hyun, who allegedly recommended the martial law imposition and resigned in the wake of the scandal. Kim attempted to end his own life in custody late Tuesday, according to the head of the country’s correctional service.\n\nOn Thursday, Yoon said he had only discussed the martial law decree with Kim before declaring it. Meanwhile parliament has already impeached both Yoon’s justice minister and his police chief.\n\nSenior government officials have testified at various government hearings over the last week revealing some extraordinary details about the night of the martial law order.\n\nSpecial Warfare Command Commander Kwak Jong-geun testified that he received a direct order from President Yoon to break the doors of the National Assembly and drag out the lawmakers, but he did not comply.\n\nSouth Korea, one of East Asia’s most important economies and vital US regional ally, now faces months of protracted political uncertainty of the kind that dominated the country during the last impeachment crisis in 2016 and 2017.\n\nThen-president Park Geun-hye was ultimately impeached by lawmakers over corruption allegations, kicked out of office by the Constitutional Court, jailed and later pardoned.\n\nCNN’s Lex Harvey, Yoonjung Seo, Gawon Bae and Billy Stockwell contributed reporting.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nSouth Korea’s parliament voted to impeach President Yoon Suk Yeol.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert at causal reasoning."}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n### CONTEXT\n[Doc 1]\nTitle: August 22, 2021\nContent: A week after the Taliban took control of Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, as the U.S. was withdrawing the forces that have been in the country since 2001, the initial chaos created by the Taliban’s rapid sweep across the country has simmered down into what is at least a temporary pattern.\n\nWe knew there was a good chance that the Taliban would regain control of the country when we left, although that was not a foregone conclusion. The former president, Donald Trump, recognized that the American people were tired of the ongoing war in Afghanistan, which was approaching its 20th year, and in February 2020, his administration negotiated with the Taliban to enable the U.S. to withdraw. In exchange for the release of 5000 Taliban fighters and the promise that the U.S. would withdraw within the next 14 months, the Taliban agreed not to attack U.S. soldiers.\n\nTrump’s dislike of the war in Afghanistan reflected the unpopularity of the long engagement, which by 2020 was ill defined. The war had begun in 2001, after terrorists affiliated with al-Qaeda attacked the United States on September 11 of that year. Taliban leaders in control of Afghanistan sheltered al-Qaeda, and after the attacks, the U.S. president, George W. Bush, demanded that Afghanistan hand over the terrorist leader believed to be behind the terrorist attack on the U.S: Osama bin Laden. In October, after Taliban leaders refused, the U.S. launched a bombing campaign.\n\nThat campaign was successful enough that in December 2001 the Taliban offered to surrender. But the U.S. rejected that surrender, determined by then to eradicate the extremist group and fill the vacuum of its collapse with a new, pro-American government. Al-Qaeda leader bin Laden escaped from Afghanistan to Pakistan, and the U.S. project in Afghanistan turned from an anti-terrorism mission into an effort to rebuild the Afghan government into a modern democracy.\n\nBy 2002 the Bush administration was articulating a new doctrine in foreign policy, arguing that the U.S. had a right to strike preemptively against countries that harbor terrorists. In 2003, under this doctrine, the U.S. launched a war on Iraq, which diverted money, troops, and attention from Afghanistan. The Taliban regrouped and began to regain the territory it had lost after the U.S. first began its bombing campaign in 2001.\n\nBy 2005, Bush administration officials privately worried the war in Afghanistan could not be won on its current terms, especially with the U.S. focused on Iraq. Then, when he took office in 2009, President Barack Obama turned his attention back to Afghanistan. He threw more troops into that country, bringing their numbers close to 100,000. In 2011, the U.S. military located bin Laden in Abbottabad, Pakistan, and launched a raid on the compound where he was hiding, killing him. By 2014, Obama had drawn troops in Afghanistan down to about 11,000, and in December of that year, he announced that the mission of the war—weakening the Taliban and capturing bin Laden—had been accomplished, and thus the war was over. The troops would come home.\n\nBut, of course, they didn’t, leaving Trump to develop his own policy. But his administration’s approach to the chaos in that country was different than his predecessor’s. By negotiating with the Taliban and excluding the Afghan government the U.S. had been supporting, the Trump team essentially accepted that the Taliban were the most important party in Afghanistan. The agreement itself reflected the oddity of the negotiations. Each clause referring to the Taliban began: “The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan which is not recognized by the United States as a state and is known as the Taliban will….”\n\nIt was immediately clear that the Taliban was not living up to its side of the bargain. Although it did stop attacking U.S. troops, It began to escalate violence in Afghanistan itself, assassinated political opponents, and maintained ties to al-Qaeda. Nonetheless, the Trump administration put pressure on the leaders of the Afghan government to release the 5000 Taliban prisoners, and they eventually did. Before Biden took office, Trump dropped the U.S. troop engagement in Afghanistan from about 13,000 to about 2500.\n\nWhen he took office, Biden had to decide whether to follow Trump’s path or to push back on the Taliban on the grounds they were not honoring the agreement Trump’s people had hammered out. Biden himself wanted to get out of the war. At the same time, he recognized that fighting the Taliban again would mean throwing more troops back into Afghanistan, and that the U.S. would again begin to take casualties. He opted to get the troops out, but extended the deadline to September 11, 2021, the twentieth anniversary of the initial attack. (Former president Trump complained that the troops should come out faster.)\n\nWhat Biden did not foresee was the speed with which the Taliban would retake control of the country. It swept over the regional capitals and then Kabul in about nine days in mid-August with barely a shot fired, and the head of the Afghan government fled the country, leaving it in chaos.\n\nThat speed left the U.S. flatfooted. Afghans who had been part of the government or who had helped the U.S. and its allies rushed to the airport to try to escape. In the pandemonium of that first day, up to seven people were killed; two people appear to have clung to a U.S. military plane as it took off, falling to their deaths.\n\nAnd yet, the Taliban, so far, has promised amnesty for its former opponents and limited rights for women. It has its own problems, as the Afghan government has been supported for the previous 20 years by foreign money, including a large percentage from the U.S. Not only has that money dried up as foreign countries refuse to back the Taliban, but also Biden has put sanctions on Afghanistan and also on some Pakistanis suspected of funding the Taliban. At the same time it appears that no other major sponsor, like Russia or China, has stepped in to fill the vacuum left by U.S. money, leaving the Taliban fishing for whatever goodwill it can find.\n\nYesterday, Josh Marshall of Talking Points Memo flagged tweets showing that members of the Afghan government, including the brother of the president who fled, are in what appear from the photos posted on Twitter to be relaxed talks about forming a new government. Other factions in Afghanistan would like to stop this from happening, and today Biden’s national security adviser Jake Sullivan warned that ISIS-K, another extremist group, is threatening to attack the airport to destabilize the Taliban.\n\nMeanwhile, there are 10,000 people crowded into that airport, and U.S. evacuations continue. The Kabul airport is secure—for now—and the U.S. military has created a larger perimeter around it for protection. The U.S. government has asked Americans in Afghanistan to shelter in place until they can be moved out safely; the Qatari ambassador to Afghanistan has been escorting groups of them to the airport. Evacuations have been slower than hoped because of backlogs at the next stage of the journey, but the government has enlisted the help of 18 commercial airlines to move those passengers forward, leaving room for new evacuees.\n\nYesterday, about 7800 evacuees left the Kabul airport. About 28,000 have been evacuated since August 14.\n\nInterestingly, much of the U.S. media is describing this scenario as a disaster for President Biden. Yet, on CNN this morning, Matthew Dowd, who was the chief strategist for the Bush-Cheney ticket in 2004, noted that more than 20,000 people have been evacuated from Afghanistan without a single loss of an American life, while in the same period of time, 5000 Americans have died from Covid-19 and 500 have died from gunshots.\n\n—-\n\nNotes:\n\nhttps://www.npr.org/2020/02/29/810537586/u-s-signs-peace-deal-with-taliban-after-nearly-2-decades-of-war-in-afghanistan\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2021/08/12/obama-afghan-war-ending-afghanistan-papers-book-excerpt/\n\nhttps://www.factcheck.org/2021/08/timeline-of-u-s-withdrawal-from-afghanistan/\n\nhttps://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/you-wouldnt-know-it-from-the-us-news-coverage-but\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/16/kabul-airport-chaos-and-panic-as-afghans-and-foreigners-attempt-to-flee-the-capital\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2021/08/22/afghanistan-biden-evacuations/\n\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2021/08/21/politics/kabul-airport-terror-warning/index.html\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/08/17/treasury-taliban-money-afghanistan/\n\nShare\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nOn August 15, 2021, the Taliban seized the presidential palace in Kabul and declared the war over.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Gen. Qassem Soleimani, killed in a drone strike early Friday, is getting the vast majority of the media attention. But several others were also killed in the attack, including militia leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis. For years, Muhandis has been one of the most important military figures in Iraq, as the deputy commander of Iraq's Popular Mobilization Forces.\n\nBorn in Iraq as Jamal Jaafar al-Ibrahimi, Muhandis fled to Iran after Saddam Hussein came to power in the late 1970s. He was among a number of Iraqis who left to fight on the side of Iran during the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s. He is considered by the U.S. and Kuwait to be the architect of the bombing of the American and French embassies in Kuwait in 1983, and was sentenced to death by a Kuwaiti court.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nMuhandis is responsible for extensive violence against American interests. In the power vacuum that developed after the death of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein in 2006, Muhandis founded Kataib Hezbollah, an anti-U.S. insurgency movement responsible for numerous American casualties. The U.S. considered Muhandis and his insurgency to be \"terrorist\" groups.\n\n\"His network was the most professional killer of Americans in Iraq,\" says Michael Knights, senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. Knights tells NPR that the vast majority of IEDs that killed hundreds of Americans in Iraq were provided by Muhandis' network. According to Knights, the U.S. considered killing Muhandis multiple times, including in June 2011, when 15 American soldiers were killed in Iraq -- the vast majority by Kataib Hezbollah.\n\nThe killing of Muhandis came after a week of violence, much of which was orchestrated by Kataib Hezbollah. On Dec. 27, the group attacked the K1 military base near the Iraqi city of Kurkuk, killing an American contractor and wounding several American and Iraqi personnel. On Tuesday, the U.S. Embassy compound in Baghdad was stormed, as a crowd of protesters set fires and militia members tried to enter the embassy. On Thursday, U.S. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper warned Iran and its \"proxy militias\" that the U.S. would retaliate.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nMuhandis developed a reputation as being able to effectively corral dozens of Iraqi militias into a relatively cohesive fighting force. The reason he could do this, Knights says, is because he had the backing of Soleimani. \"Muhandis was a politician,\" Knights says. \"He was an Eisenhower, not a Patton.\"\n\nSecurity experts are divided on whether Muhandis was specifically targeted in the drone attack. \"It's highly likely that they were targeting him,\" Anthony Cordesman, the Burke chair in strategy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, tells NPR. \"They hit two cars. As I understand it, there were more than two cars on the road. The strikes had to have a reasonable amount of precision.\"\n\nKnights says that the operation was designed to take out Soleimani, and it was a \"bonus\" that Muhandis happened to personally pick him up off the airplane. \"It really helps to have got both.\"\n\nHad only Muhandis been killed, the first Iraqi reaction would be to ask Soleimani who could replace him, Knights says. If only Soleimani had been killed, Muhandis would still be there to lead military operations. \"Getting one or the other would have left a lot of leadership structure in place. This gives the entire system a really heavy jolt.\"\n\n\"Their combined death is certainly a blow to the Iranian project in Iraq, but how much remains to be seen,\" says Thomas Joscelyn, senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. It's hard for a Western observer to know how important Muhandis was in terms of decision-making and internal dynamics within the PMF, Joscelyn tells NPR. Was he a uniquely important figure? Or just another leader whose job can be effectively performed by his successor?\n\nCordesman agrees that exactly how great an impact Muhandis' death will have is still unknown. \"We tend to demonize these people as if they were absolutely critical, stable figures, but you had a pretty competent Iranian deputy take over the al-Quds force in less than a day,\" says Cordesman, referring to Esmail Ghaani. \"The whole idea that you paralyze a movement by getting rid of the leader, if that's true we don't have any recent examples.\"\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nA U.S. drone strike killed Iranian Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani and Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis after Muhandis picked up Soleimani from an airplane.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA. On December 31, pro-Iranian protesters attacked the US Embassy in Baghdad.\nB.

The bill passed with a 68-30 vote. It's a milestone day for the crypto industry, which put around $250 million into the 2024 cycle to elect what's now considered to be the most pro-crypto Congress in U.S. history, and for President Donald Trump's sprawling digital asset empire. \"The GENIUS Act will protect consumers, enable responsible innovation, and safeguard the dominance of the U.S. dollar,\" said Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., one of the sponsors of the bill, in a statement. The bill still faces hurdles in the Republican-held House, but passage in the Senate signals a turning point — not just for the technology, but for the political clout behind it. The GENIUS Act, short for the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act, sets guardrails for the industry, including full reserve backing, monthly audits, and anti-money laundering compliance. It also opens the door to a broader range of issuers, including banks, fintechs, and major retailers looking to launch their own stablecoins or integrate them into existing payment systems.\n\nwatch now\n\nThe legislation grants sweeping authority to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who last week told a Senate appropriations subcommittee in a hearing that the U.S. stablecoin market could grow nearly eightfold to over $2 trillion in the next few years. The bill's passage drew sharp criticism from Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., who accused Republicans of \"rubberstamping Trump's crypto corruption,\" and allowing the president to sell \"access to the government for personal profit.\" Merkley had pushed for an amendment to bar elected officials from personally profiting off digital assets, but said GOP lawmakers blocked all efforts to hold a floor vote. In May, Senate Democrats unveiled the \"End Crypto Corruption Act,\" spearheaded by Merkley and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, meant to prohibit elected officials and senior executive branch personnel and their families from issuing or endorsing digital assets. GENIUS now heads to the House, which has its own version of a stablecoin bill dubbed STABLE. Both prohibit yield-bearing consumer stablecoins — but diverge on who regulates what. The Senate's version centralizes oversight with Treasury, while the House splits authority between the Federal Reserve, the Comptroller of the Currency, and others. Reconciling the two could take a while, according to congressional aides. The GENIUS Act was supposed to be the easiest crypto bill to pass, but took months to reach the Senate floor, failed once, and passed only after fierce negotiations. \"We thought it would be easiest to start with stablecoins,\" Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., said on stage in Las Vegas at this year's Bitcoin 2025 conference, which focused heavily on stablecoins. \"It has been extremely difficult. I had no idea how hard this was going to be,\" she said. At the same event, Sen. Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn., echoed the frustration: \"It has been murder to get them there,\" he said of the 18 Senate Democrats who ultimately crossed the aisle.\n\nwatch now\n\nDisrupting legacy rails\n\nStablecoins are a subset of cryptocurrencies pegged to the value of real-world assets. About 99% of all stablecoins are tethered to the price of the U.S. dollar. They offer instant settlement and lower transaction fees, cutting out the middlemen and directly threatening legacy payment rails. Shopify has already rolled out USDC -powered payments through Coinbase and Stripe. Bank of America 's CEO said last week at a Morgan Stanley conference that the bank is having conversations with the industry and individually exploring stablecoin issuance. Deutsche Bank found that stablecoin transactions hit $28 trillion last year, surpassing that of Mastercard and Visa, combined. Still, there are limits. The GENIUS Act restricts non-financial large tech companies from directly issuing stablecoins unless they establish or partner with regulated financial entities — a provision meant to blunt monopoly concerns. JPMorgan Chase , meanwhile, is taking a different route, launching JPMD, a deposit token designed to function like a stablecoin but tightly integrated with the traditional banking system. Issued on Coinbase's Base blockchain, JPMD is only available to institutional clients and offers features like 24/7 settlement and interest payments — part of the broader push by legacy finance to adapt to the stablecoin era without ceding ground to crypto-native firms.\n\nwatch now\n\nTrump's stake\n\nWhile Democrats tried to amend the bill to prevent the president from profiting off crypto ventures, the final legislation only bars members of Congress and their families from doing so. Trump's first financial disclosure as president, released Friday, revealed he earned at least $57 million in 2024 alone from token sales tied to World Liberty Financial, a crypto platform closely aligned with his political brand. He holds nearly 16 billion WLFI governance tokens — the crypto equivalent of voting shares — which could be worth close to $1 billion on paper, based on prior private sales. That's just one slice of the Trump crypto pie. The family's ventures, which include the controversial $TRUMP meme coin, a $2.5 billion bitcoin Treasury and proposed bitcoin and ether ETFs via Truth.Fi, and a newly launched mining firm called American Bitcoin, reflect an aggressive push into digital finance. Forbes recently estimated Trump's crypto holdings at nearly $1 billion, lifting his total net worth to $5.6 billion.

Satellite data from Brazil's National Institute of Space Research shows that there have been more than 74,000 fires this year, many of them in the Amazon. The demonstrations are \"in defense of the Amazon and our future,\" according to organizers.\n\nOver the past few days, international pressure has been steadily growing on Bolsonaro over his handling of the issue, especially from European leaders. A spokesman for Britain's newly installed prime minister, Boris Johnson, said he was \"deeply concerned\" about the fires and \"the impact of the tragic loss of these precious habitats.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron plans to highlight the Amazon crisis at this weekend's G-7 summit in Biarritz, France, after sending out a tweet describing them as \"an international crisis\" and declaring: \"Our house is burning. Literally. The Amazon rain forest — the lungs which produces 20% of the planet's oxygen — is on fire.\"\n\nMacron raised the pressure on Brazil on Friday, issuing a statement accusing Bolsonaro of lying to him about his position on climate change and announcing that France has withdrawn its support for the Mercosur trade deal between the European Union and a South American bloc that includes Brazil. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar warned that Ireland would pull out of the Mercosur agreement if Brazil did not take action to protect the rainforest, according to Reuters.\n\nBolsonaro has made clear that he considers the Amazon rainforest — 60% of which is in Brazil — to be an issue of national sovereignty, and he makes no secret of his resentment at what he deems to be foreign interference driven by a desire to hold back Brazilian agrobusiness from competing in international markets.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption AP AP\n\nIn recent weeks, he has alienated Germany and Norway, the two main contributors to the Amazon Fund, which supports forest preservation initiatives, prompting them to withhold tens of millions of dollars.\n\nHis approach has won applause from his supporters on the far right, but is also causing widespread fears among Brazilians that it is proving highly damaging to the country's international standing and may prompt a backlash that could impact exports.\n\n\"The image of the burning forest ignites public opinion and incinerates Brazil's reputation,\" wrote Ana Lucia Azevedo, a columnist for O Globo. She warns that the crisis is wrecking \"the prestige and credibility\" acquired by Brazil after 2005, when deforestation rates dipped sharply.\n\nAnother commentator, Vinicius Torrer Freire, wrote: \"Within a few months, especially in recent weeks, he has knocked down two decades of improvements in Brazil's international image regarding the environment.\"\n\nBolsonaro argues that it is possible simultaneously to develop the Amazon and preserve the forest. His critics point to his record of relentlessly undermining institutions responsible for preserving and monitoring the Amazon.\n\nSince taking office in January, he has severely weakened government environmental enforcement organizations, by cutting budgets and laying off staff. When Brazil's National Institute of Space Research released satellite data showing a sharp month-on-month rise in deforestation over last year, Bolsonaro dismissed this as \"lies\" and replaced the director with a military official.\n\nLatin America Brazil's Amazon Rainforest Is Disappearing Under President Jair Bolsonaro Brazil's Amazon Rainforest Is Disappearing Under President Jair Bolsonaro Listen · 7:57 7:57\n\nHis approach is causing deep concern among professionals fighting to protect the forest, who argue that these moves send the wrong message to illegal deforesters.\n\n\"They feel emboldened to carry out more deforestation,\" said Fluvio Mascarenhas, who works for the Chico Mendes Institute for the Conversation of Biodiversity — a government monitoring agency — in the western state of Acre.\n\nIn a recent interview with NPR, Mascarenhas expressed profound concern about the impact of Bolsonaro's policies.\n\n\"Every time you look at a satellite image of the forest, you see another little piece is missing,\" he said.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nPresident Bolsonaro announced a 60-day ban on setting fires for land clearing and deployed 44,000 soldiers to seven states.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Gen. Qassem Soleimani, killed in a drone strike early Friday, is getting the vast majority of the media attention. But several others were also killed in the attack, including militia leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis. For years, Muhandis has been one of the most important military figures in Iraq, as the deputy commander of Iraq's Popular Mobilization Forces.\n\nBorn in Iraq as Jamal Jaafar al-Ibrahimi, Muhandis fled to Iran after Saddam Hussein came to power in the late 1970s. He was among a number of Iraqis who left to fight on the side of Iran during the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s. He is considered by the U.S. and Kuwait to be the architect of the bombing of the American and French embassies in Kuwait in 1983, and was sentenced to death by a Kuwaiti court.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nMuhandis is responsible for extensive violence against American interests. In the power vacuum that developed after the death of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein in 2006, Muhandis founded Kataib Hezbollah, an anti-U.S. insurgency movement responsible for numerous American casualties. The U.S. considered Muhandis and his insurgency to be \"terrorist\" groups.\n\n\"His network was the most professional killer of Americans in Iraq,\" says Michael Knights, senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. Knights tells NPR that the vast majority of IEDs that killed hundreds of Americans in Iraq were provided by Muhandis' network. According to Knights, the U.S. considered killing Muhandis multiple times, including in June 2011, when 15 American soldiers were killed in Iraq -- the vast majority by Kataib Hezbollah.\n\nThe killing of Muhandis came after a week of violence, much of which was orchestrated by Kataib Hezbollah. On Dec. 27, the group attacked the K1 military base near the Iraqi city of Kurkuk, killing an American contractor and wounding several American and Iraqi personnel. On Tuesday, the U.S. Embassy compound in Baghdad was stormed, as a crowd of protesters set fires and militia members tried to enter the embassy. On Thursday, U.S. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper warned Iran and its \"proxy militias\" that the U.S. would retaliate.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nMuhandis developed a reputation as being able to effectively corral dozens of Iraqi militias into a relatively cohesive fighting force. The reason he could do this, Knights says, is because he had the backing of Soleimani. \"Muhandis was a politician,\" Knights says. \"He was an Eisenhower, not a Patton.\"\n\nSecurity experts are divided on whether Muhandis was specifically targeted in the drone attack. \"It's highly likely that they were targeting him,\" Anthony Cordesman, the Burke chair in strategy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, tells NPR. \"They hit two cars. As I understand it, there were more than two cars on the road. The strikes had to have a reasonable amount of precision.\"\n\nKnights says that the operation was designed to take out Soleimani, and it was a \"bonus\" that Muhandis happened to personally pick him up off the airplane. \"It really helps to have got both.\"\n\nHad only Muhandis been killed, the first Iraqi reaction would be to ask Soleimani who could replace him, Knights says. If only Soleimani had been killed, Muhandis would still be there to lead military operations. \"Getting one or the other would have left a lot of leadership structure in place. This gives the entire system a really heavy jolt.\"\n\n\"Their combined death is certainly a blow to the Iranian project in Iraq, but how much remains to be seen,\" says Thomas Joscelyn, senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. It's hard for a Western observer to know how important Muhandis was in terms of decision-making and internal dynamics within the PMF, Joscelyn tells NPR. Was he a uniquely important figure? Or just another leader whose job can be effectively performed by his successor?\n\nCordesman agrees that exactly how great an impact Muhandis' death will have is still unknown. \"We tend to demonize these people as if they were absolutely critical, stable figures, but you had a pretty competent Iranian deputy take over the al-Quds force in less than a day,\" says Cordesman, referring to Esmail Ghaani. \"The whole idea that you paralyze a movement by getting rid of the leader, if that's true we don't have any recent examples.\"\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nIraqi caretaker Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi condemned the US air raid as a violation of Iraq’s sovereignty.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

He said: “I’m confident in the US but we can’t be complacent.”\n\nThe Prime Minister’s spokesman downplayed suggestions the UK was at risk of being left behind, saying Britain had “significant strengths in AI” and “some very strong players in the market”. Sir Keir Starmer has said the UK should become one of the “great AI superpowers”.\n\nUS tech companies have committed to spending hundreds of billions in the belief that building super-human AI will require unprecedented investments in data centres, electricity and microchips.\n\nLast week Donald Trump hailed a $500 billion (£400 billion) plan by the tech companies OpenAI, SoftBank and Oracle as the “largest AI infrastructure project in history”. In contrast, DeepSeek claims that one of its recent systems cost just $5.6 million to develop.\n\nThe claim sparked alarm about possible overspending by US companies. America’s Nasdaq stock market fell by more than 3 per cent on Monday, with the drop at one point wiping more than $1 trillion off the index of technology stocks. Shares in Nvidia fell by more than 15 per cent.\n\nMarc Andreessen, the Trump-backing Silicon Valley venture capitalist, said DeepSeek’s latest “R1” system was “one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I’ve ever seen” and called it “AI’s Sputnik moment”, in reference to the Soviet satellite that shocked the Western world in 1957 and accelerated the Cold War space race.\n\nDeepSeek’s success will also ignite concerns about China’s influence over the global internet.\n\nChinese chatbots are rigorously tested by Beijing’s censors to ensure that they adhere to “core socialist values”. DeepSeek refuses to answer questions on subjects such as the Tiananmen Square protests. It insists that Taiwan is an “inalienable part of China” and that reports of human rights abuses in Xinjiang are “unfounded and politically motivated”.\n\nWestern governments have cracked down on Chinese-owned apps such as TikTok in recent years amid cybersecurity fears and concerns that they could be used to promote Chinese Communist Party views.\n\nThe US has heavily restricted Chinese access to the most advanced AI microchips on national security grounds, with a series of trade measures that it had hoped would thwart the country’s advances.\n\nIn response to a tweet suggesting that DeepSeek had skirted US export restrictions to access thousands of high-end microchips, Elon Musk said: “Obviously.”\n\nDeepSeek said that it was limiting how many people could sign up “due to large-scale malicious attacks” on its services.\n\nRead the latest updates below.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nTrade controls forced Chinese researchers to use freely available tools creatively.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

French journalist Sandra Muller started the campaign with a tweet in which she shared her own experience with a man who lewdly told her, “You have big breasts. You are my type of woman. I will make you orgasm all night.”\n\n“Balance ton porc” is the latest anti-sexism salvo in a country that has long struggled over a where to draw the line in a culture of where celebrating sexual freedom can tip over into widespread permissiveness for inappropriate behavior and unwanted advances.\n\nAll of which may soon face a new legal challenge.\n\nMarlène Schiappa, France’s gender equality minister (yes, that’s a thing), has proposed putting forward a bill in parliament that would fine people for engaging in street harassment — including aggressive catcalls.\n\n“The point is that the whole of society has to redefine what it will accept and what it will not,” Schiappa told La Croix, a French Catholic newspaper. On French radio she explained that policing behavior on the street is “completely necessary because at the moment street harassment is not defined in the law. … We can’t currently make a complaint.”\n\nPressed on what behaviors would be considered harassment, she replied, “We know very well at what point we start feeling intimidated, unsafe, or harassed in the street.”\n\nHarassment often goes unaddressed in France\n\nA 2016 study by the French polling firm IFOP found that of 1,048 cases of sexual harassment in France, only 65 led to a conviction. And a 2014 French government poll found that one in five French women had experienced harassment at work. Of that group, 30 percent never shared their stories.\n\nSchiappa pointed out in the interview with the newspaper La Croix that 84,000 women in France are raped each year and 220,000 will experience assault. “We want to reduce those statistics for violence,” she explained.\n\nBut Schiappa’s ideas go further than just the street. She has also proposed extending the statute of limitations on assault cases that involve minors. Currently, French law allows underage victims to file charges for sexual assault up to 20 years after the victim turns 18. Schiappa wants that stretched to 30 years. She’d like to raise the age of consent as well.\n\nSchiappa has reached out to the public for comment, and to legal and psychiatric professionals to weigh in during conversations on how far legislation should extend. The law itself won’t be debated until next year.\n\nA mother of two and former blogger and author, Schiappa has a number of other big ideas for advancing the rights of French women. She’d like to get the state to cover maternity leave for the self-employed, and to amend French law to give lesbians and single women the right to conceive through artificial insemination.\n\nBut street harassment is first on the list. In a long Guardian profile of Schiappa that ran last June, she mused that charging piggish men 5,000 euros might just sting enough to get those men to pay attention.\n\nThe Weinstein scandal has reached the French, too\n\nOver the weekend, French President Emmanuel Macron expressed the entire country’s horror over Harvey Weinstein. He announced that Weinstein would be stripped of the Légion d’honneur, the country’s highest civilian honor, which the disgraced producer received in 2012.\n\nSeveral French actresses have recently shared their own stories of Weinstein’s advances.\n\nFrench actress Léa Seydoux detailed her horrifying Weinstein experience in the Guardian. Photo by Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images\n\n“We were talking on the sofa when he suddenly jumped on me and tried to kiss me,” actress Léa Seydoux wrote in the Guardian last week. “I had to defend myself. He’s big and fat, so I had to be forceful to resist him. I left his room, thoroughly disgusted. I wasn’t afraid of him, though. Because I knew what kind of man he was all along.”\n\nSpeaking to the press, Macron’s wife Brigitte Macron lauded women for sharing their stories. “I’m very happy that women are speaking out. It could be a cloud with a silver lining,” she said.\n\n“I urge them to break their silence. It’s wonderful. Something is happening, really,” she added.\n\nThe Weinstein case is hardly the first sexual harassment and assault scandal that has rocked France\n\nAmong the most lurid of French scandals is the case of Dominique Strauss-Kahn. The former head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) — and one-time French political luminary — was charged with attempted rape in 2011. (The charges were eventually dropped.) In 2012, he was accused of having literally pimped out prostitutes for parties. After four years of court battles, during which France — and the world — became privy to his world of sex parties, he was acquitted of wrongdoing.\n\nBut the Strauss-Kahn story opened up a conversation in France about the limits of both private life and propriety.\n\nIn 2015, the French government tried stopping street harassment with a poster campaign called “Stop — Ça Suffit!” (“Stop — that’s enough!”), which showed gradations of street harassment laid out on a line, like stops on a bus. It began with “Mademoiselle!” (Miss!) and ended with “Réponds Sale Chiens!” (“Say something, you filthy bitch!”).\n\nCa Suffit — that’s enough. Republished in the UK’s Independent newspaper.\n\nThe poster campaign ran after a poll conducted by a women’s rights group in France found that 100 percent of French women had been harassed on public transport. (That’s not a typo, but the results were contested.)\n\nThen, in 2016, several female members of parliament accused fellow MP Denis Baupin, of the Green Party, of a range of crimes including assault, untoward texting, and other forms of harassment. “One day in October 2011 he pressed me against the wall, holding my breasts, and tried to kiss me,” a Green party spokesperson, Sandrine Rousseau, told French radio.\n\nElen Debost, a fellow member of parliament also from the Green Party, reported having received more than 100 texts from Baupin with messages such as, “I am on the train and I’d like to sodomize you wearing thigh-high boots.” Other women reported cases of similar harassment. Baupin’s lawyer called the accusations defamatory and mendacious. Baupin resigned but, as of now, he has not suffered further consequences.\n\nA group of women with beard hold a banner reading “The beard” (French expression “la barbe” meaning “enough”) and “No harassment, only compliments” during a rally against the sexual harassment of women in front of the National Assembly in Paris on May 11, 2016. DOMINIQUE FAGET/AFP/Getty Images\n\nJust this week, in the midst of the “Expose your pig” campaign, a French rock magazine, Les Inrockuptibles, put a once-disgraced French pop star Bertrand Cantat on the cover of their newest issue in advance of a new album set to drop later this fall. The reaction has been swift, and angry, among French women.\n\nThat’s because Cantat’s story is an egregious one: He was convicted of killing his girlfriend, Marie Trintignant, in 2003; she was beaten to death. He was released from jail on good behavior after serving only four years. To expose this hypocrisy, French Elle countered the rock magazine by running an image of Marie — Cantat’s victim — on its cover, and the stark phrase “In the Name of Marie.”\n\nLes Inrockuptibles issued a somewhat half-hearted mea culpa. “To put him on the cover was questionable. To those who felt wounded, we express our sincere regrets.”\n\nExpose your pig, indeed.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nFrench women launched the #BalanceTonPorc social media campaign, sharing stories of aggression and harassment.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Most had been isolating for months as the coronavirus pandemic took hold.\n\nBut the death of yet another Black person at the hands of police seemed to shatter a dam in the American conscious.\n\nProtesters march from Lafayette Square to the US Capitol on May 29, 2020, to protest George Floyd's murder earlier that week. Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe 7-acre green space just north of the White House, known as Lafayette Square, had been a rallying place for change for more than a century, from women’s suffrage marches in 1917 to the fight for racial equality and gay rights half a century later.\n\nAnd so it was where protesters gathered to mourn the death of this 46-year-old father, George Floyd.\n\nFor Thomas, standing among the thousands of Americans of all races and faiths and demanding racial equality changed the way she thought about criminal justice and her role as a pastor serving a nearby church.\n\nIt was “this cathartic release, this need to demonstrate, to protest, to yell and to not hold the grief that this had triggered,” she said.\n\nAs the crowd chanted the names of Black lives lost to police violence – Tamir Rice, Sandra Bland, Eric Garner, Breonna Taylor – it began to feel to Thomas like a prayer.\n\n“That was a holy experience for me that is unmatched,” she said.\n\nThe daytime demonstrations were largely peaceful.\n\nBut as night fell on Washington – and other American cities – their tone changed.\n\nProtesters confront police on May 30, 2020.

Eric Baradat/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAfter nights of clashes, then-President Donald Trump, known for issuing directives and invectives through social media, fired off a series of posts shortly before 1 a.m. on Friday, May 29, 2020.\n\nHe condemned protests in Minneapolis that had become violent.\n\n“These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd,” he wrote before pivoting to a stark ultimatum:\n\n“Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts.”\n\nOutside the White House that evening, people began throwing rocks. Some tried to topple police barricades. The Secret Service rushed Trump and his family to the executive mansion’s bunker.\n\n“Nobody came close to breaching the fence,” Trump posted the following day. “If they had, they would have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen.”\n\nTrump’s allusions to police brutality – the very thing demonstrators were protesting – only seemed to rile them and underscore what was at stake.\n\nIt was also prescient.\n\nDemonstrations kept swelling through the weekend. Offices and other buildings around Lafayette Square were boarded up. But it didn’t stop the destruction.\n\nCrews board up buildings May 31, 2020, near the White House. Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images\n\nThe windows of Michelle Brown and Linda Neumann’s tea shop by the White House were smashed and the café set on fire, they told an influential city magazine. Even so, Brown quickly took to social media to underscore her support for those peacefully demanding change:\n\n“Before anyone puts a single word in our mouths,” she wrote: “Black lives matter.”\n\n“There’s insurance to cover things like this,” Neumann told the magazine. “We are both just so sad and heartbroken about what’s happening in the country and how things came to this.”\n\nThen, late Sunday night, an arsonist set fire to the basement of St. John’s Church, a landmark crowning the top of Lafayette Square and often referred to as the “presidents church” because so many have worshipped there.\n\nThe physical damage was minimal. But the flames ignited a series of events that soon would alter the landscape of the district itself.\n\nA man is injured during a May 30, 2020, protest near the White House.

Only this time, they were met by police.\n\nThe law enforcement presence was subtle at first. Officers observed from the park as demonstrators waved signs and chanted, “Hands up, don’t shoot!” and “No Justice! No Peace.”\n\nBut as the day wore on, the police presence grew. Journalists noticed.\n\n“These protests until now have been entirely calm,” CNN correspondent Alex Marquardt told Wolf Blitzer.\n\nUS Park Police stand watch June 1, 2020, as demonstrators protest at Lafayette Square.

Hundreds of National Guard troops staged near the park. A line of mounted police officers towered above the protesters and kept watch.\n\nThe White House announced Trump would make a statement in the Rose Garden.\n\nThe officers, Marquardt said, began to pull on gas masks.\n\nIn seconds, things went from peaceful to pandemonium.\n\nCNN\n\nA woman cries out after being exposed to tear gas on June 1, 2020, near the White House.

People fell. Others took a knee before the advancing line of police.\n\nMany retreated toward St. John’s Church.\n\nAs police descended, Thomas thought of the 1965 civil rights march to Montgomery, Alabama, that saw a young activist named John Lewis beaten bloody on a bridge in Selma.\n\n“All that was missing was a water hose and some dogs,” she recalled. “We’re marching to advance a cause – to say you can’t just kill people without due process – and you’re pushing us back with violence.”\n\nTear gas canisters cracked like thunder, and flash bangs echoed across White House lawns. Somehow, the Rose Garden maintained a relative tranquility, and from it, Trump spoke to the American people.\n\n“I will fight to protect you. I am your president of law and order and an ally of all peaceful protesters,” he said as helicopters whirred.\n\nTrump called on mayors and governors across the country to “dominate the streets” and “establish an overwhelming law enforcement presence until the violence has been quelled.”\n\nThen, he left the stage and made his way across the park.\n\nStanding in front of the boarded-up St. John’s Church, the president posed with a Bible, holding it in the air.\n\n“We have a great country,” he told reporters.\n\nPresident Donald Trump walks on June 1, 2020, between lines of riot police toward St. John's Church. Tom Brenner/Reuters\n\nCNN\n\nIt wasn’t long before pundits launched debates over Trump’s sacred prop, critics argued about the use of active-duty military against Americans exercising First Amendment rights and politicians lined up to assign blame.\n\nIn the office of the mayor of Washington, DC, the response was quieter as officials moved into action to make clear to the world – and the president living down the street – the city’s undisputed stance on the moral moment gripping the nation.\n\nFirst, they called Keyonna Jones.\n\nAn artist born and raised in Southeast DC, Jones – like many Americans – had been struggling to reconcile her own struggles in the pandemic with the injustice of Floyd’s death, she said.\n\nAll the same, she answered the phone. And in less than 24 hours, she was across town on 16th Street NW.\n\nWith an army of volunteers, friends, neighbors and municipal workers, Jones began to emblazon the two blocks leading directly to the White House with 50-foot letters that spelled out the moment’s words of empowerment so indelibly, they could be seen from space:\n\nA satellite photo shows the new plaza in June 2020. Maxar Technologies/Reuters\n\nOn June 5 – just 11 days after Floyd took his last breath – the district officially unveiled Black Lives Matter Plaza. The date happened to coincide with the birthday of Breonna Taylor, the Black American whose life had been cut tragically short that March in an encounter with police.\n\n“We know what’s going on in our country,” Mayor Muriel Bowser said. “We had the opportunity to send that message loud and clear on a very important street in our city … And that message is to the American people that Black Lives Matter, that Black humanity matters, and we as a city raise that up as part of our values.”\n\nKeyonna Jones\n\nCNN\n\nOther cities followed suit. In Montgomery, Alabama, the phrase marked the spot where enslaved people once were auctioned. In Tulsa, Oklahoma, the same kind of yellow letters were painted along Greenwood Avenue in homage to the lives stolen in the 1921 Race Massacre. New York commissioned a mural along 5th Avenue, just outside Trump Tower. More murals appeared in Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom.\n\nThey often were spurned. Many were vandalized. And some people, including Trump, saw them as divisive. He called Manhattan’s mural a “symbol of hate.”\n\nEven some within the Black Lives Matter movement declared the murals “performative,” an attempt by public officials to absolve themselves of the immensely hard work of rooting out systemic racism.\n\n“I think art is part of activism,” countered Jones, the artist. “It’s a universal language – people will see it, people will feel it and it’s starting a conversation that may not have happened.”\n\nNew York's Black Lives Matter street mural is vandalized on August 23, 2020, in a counter-protest outside Trump Tower.

The 80-year-old was battling pancreatic cancer, but he was determined to see the mural in person, a spokesperson said.\n\nForty days later, he died.\n\nThe district the following year spent millions making the mural a permanent installation, replacing traditional asphalt with colored pavers to spell out its eponymous phrase. The goal, the mayor said, was to transform “the mural into a monument.”\n\nIn its quieter moments, the public art acted as a beacon, calling on Americans – together – to mourn, celebrate, argue, strategize and reflect on the ongoing fight against racism in the United States and the nation’s commitment to equality.\n\nAnd, sure enough, it outlasted the pandemic. And the trial and conviction of Floyd’s murderer. And the entire Biden administration. And Trump’s return this year to the White House.\n\nThousands gather on November 7, 2020, at Black Lives Matter Plaza in Washington to celebrate Joe Biden's electoral victory.

That doesn’t make sense.”\n\nAs Thomas watched the construction crews and excavators, she felt gutted and angry. In the nearly five years since Floyd’s death, she’d opted against preaching from the pulpit and instead ministered directly to activists and advocates leading protest movements across the country.\n\nWitnessing the ordered destruction, she wondered: “Are you thinking if you dig this up … you can just erase what we’ve done here?”\n\nCNN\n\nThen, in full view of the workers, Thomas picked up a chunk of the mural and walked away.\n\nIt was “an act of defiance, an act of resistance,” she said. “You can’t erase memory. You can’t erase conviction.”\n\nJones felt much the same way. Five years after her artwork drew global attention, the United States has seemingly returned to its status quo, she said, with conversations about – and, more importantly, actions toward – racial equality fading again into the background.\n\nStill, the artist said, her father recently reminded her of a speech by the Rev. Jesse Jackson, the civil rights leader who rushed to but could not save a dying Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nIn the speech, Jackson invoked the biblical boy David who fells the giant Goliath and encouraged Americans to continue to fight systems of injustice and not to be brought down by the “margin of despair.”\n\n“We have to recognize that we’re Davids,” Jones said. “There are rocks laying around that we can use to defeat the system.”\n\nWe just have to pick them up.\n\nTears roll down the face of Starlette Thomas on March 10 as she holds a chunk of pavement from the Black Lives Matter Plaza mural.

In a shock twist, a rebellion led by Wagner Group chief Yevgeny Prigozhin appeared on Saturday to develop into a short-lived military coup. After seizing official buildings in the southern city of Rostov-on-Don — which borders Ukraine and is an important logistical hub for the Kremlin’s war effort — and launching a column of armored vehicles towards Moscow, Prigozhin announced Saturday evening that he was halting the march towards the capital and that his soldiers would retreat to their camps “to avoid bloodshed.”\n\nAt the end of a frenetic day, the Kremlin announced that it planned to drop all charges against Prigozhin and the soldiers who took part in the uprising. And that the Wagner leader, whose whereabouts Putin’s spokesman said were unknown, would be allowed to take refuge in Belarus.\n\nPrigozhin’s rebellion against the Defense Ministry, which turned into the first coup attempt Russia has seen in three decades, has weakened Russian President Vladimir Putin and his regime as it faces the Ukrainian counteroffensive.\n\n“Now the moment has come when blood can be shed,” said Prigozhin in an audio broadcast on one of his Telegram channels. “Therefore, realizing all the responsibility for the fact that Russian blood will be shed from one side, we will turn our convoys around and go in the opposite direction to our field camps.”\n\nAccording to Western intelligence sources, behind-the-scenes negotiations with the mercenary chief to halt the march took place all day long. Since Saturday morning, Prigozhin escalated his defiance and rebellion by seizing the center of the border town of Rostov-on-Don and then ignored Putin’s warnings to stand down.\n\nBelarusian President Aleksandr Lukashenko claimed credit for negotiating the deal, saying in a statement that an “absolutely profitable and acceptable” agreement had been reached and that he had been given unspecified “security guarantees” for the mercenaries. Prigozhin’s revolt was extremely risky: the businessman does not have the support of the elites.\n\nDuring Friday night and Saturday day, Prigozhin crossed his own personal Rubicon. Backed into a corner by his escalating dispute with Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, he launched a rebellion that, even if it has fizzled out now, could not be without consequences. President Putin — who until Saturday had permitted Prigozhin’s quarrels with his defense minister — charged against the mercenaries chief, accusing Prigozhin of treason and “stabbing the Russian people in the back.” He promised to crush the coup, promising to “decisive action” to stabilize the situation.\n\nPrigozhin and his mercenaries met little opposition in their march towards Moscow. There were several attacks from the air with regular army helicopters, gunfire from a fighter plane and two fuel tanks were blown up to hinder their advance. The uprising is the most serious threat the Kremlin has faced since the Chechen war two decades ago. The situation may fuel internal conflicts in Russia, triggered by the defeats of the Kremlin forces in Ukraine and the lack of means, material and preparation of Russia’s troops. Prigozhin has denounced all these problems in a constant litany that has helped him gain greater visibility.\n\nThe Wagner crisis and its resolution are of grave geopolitical importance, given Russia possesses one of the world’s largest arsenals of nuclear weapons. Globally, it was met with a muted global reaction. The G-7 countries held an emergency call and, together with the EU and NATO allies, said they were closely monitoring the situation. But they did not venture to say more, fearing the Kremlin could use their words in their rhetoric against the West. Instead, they described the situation as an “internal problem” for Russia. Meanwhile, Russia’s Foreign Ministry warned Western countries against trying to “exploit” the Wagner Group rebellion “to achieve their Russophobic goals.”\n\nRussian authorities on Saturday declared an “anti-terrorist operations regime” in Moscow, which allowed them to close roads, monitor conversations and restrict movement. Before Prigozhin announced an end to the Wagner Group’s so-called “march for justice,” Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin declared that next Monday would be a non-working day — except for security forces and city services — and urged citizens to avoid the streets.\n\nIn a fiery speech on Saturday, Putin lashed out at what he considered the mercenary leader’s betrayal — until now, Prigozhin had been loyal to the Russian president and left him out of his verbal attacks against Shoigu, Moscow elites and “corrupt bureaucrats.” Without mentioning Prigozhin by name, Putin compared Saturday’s uprising to the 1917 revolution that destroyed the Russian Empire, “when the country was fighting World War I, but its victory was stolen.”\n\n“We will not let this happen again. We will protect our people and state from any threats, including internal betrayal. What we’re facing is exactly a betrayal,” said Putin in a five-minute speech broadcast Saturday morning on state TV. “Big ambitions and personal interests led to treason. Betrayal of one’s own country and people and of the cause that fighters of Wagner were dying for alongside our soldiers.”\n\n“Any internal mutiny is a deadly threat to our state, to us as a nation. It’s a blow against Russia, against our people. And our actions to defend the fatherland from such a threat will be brutal,” said Putin, who added that security forces had been ordered to regain control of the city of Rostov-on-Don. Information from flight tracking and registration websites showed that at least two aircraft of the fleet that carries the Kremlin leadership flew from Moscow to St. Petersburg on Saturday afternoon. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov maintained that Putin was still in the capital.\n\nIn response to Putin’s speech, Prigozhin released an audio message on his Telegram channels, in which he argued that the Russian president was “sorely mistaken” and defended Wagner mercenaries as the true patriots of Russia. “No one is going to give themselves up at the request of the president, the [Russian secret service] FSB or anyone else. We don’t want this country to go on living in corruption, deception and bureaucracy,” said Prigozhin, hours before standing down, in a heated message against military elites, whom he accuses of sending Russian troops unprepared into the “meat grinder” of Ukraine.\n\nThe decision to retreat was opposed by some members of the Wagner Group, who have accused Prigozhin of being a politician “like the rest” and of “incriminating” the mercenaries with his rebellion. Messages from mercenaries claiming they were breaking their contract with Wagner went viral on some Telegram channels, although local media footage from Rostov-on-Don, which acted as a base for the mercenaries on Saturday, showed several of them relaxing and talking to citizens.\n\nWindow of opportunity for Ukrainian counteroffensive\n\nWagner’s rebellion may have major consequences for the war in Ukraine due to its implication for frontline troops and the fact that it comes at a decisive moment for the Ukrainian counteroffensive. Ukrainian Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Maliar said Saturday that the rebellion, which exposes the cracks already pervading Russian society, is a “window of opportunity” for her forces. The decision to launch the full-scale invasion of Ukraine has triggered “the inevitable degradation of the Russian state,” she said.\n\nKyiv, which estimates that Moscow keeps some 400,000 Russian military personnel deployed in Ukraine, welcomed the instability in the invading country. “Everything is just beginning in Russia,” Mykhailo Podolyak, a top adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said Saturday, referring to the divisions shaking the neighboring country. According to Podolyak, it was impossible for both sides to emerge unscathed from the revolt: either the Kremlin or Prigozhin had to be defeated.\n\n“The split between the elites is now too obvious,” said Podolyak. “Someone must lose.” In a message on Twitter, the adviser also pointed out that the “counter-terrorist operation” had already resulted in the seizure of Rostov, a number of federal highways and the military headquarters of the Southern District.\n\nBritish intelligence reports say that Russia is facing its biggest domestic challenge in years, in which the degree of the military’s loyalty to the Kremlin will be key. The well-known enmity between Prigozhin and the Kremlin has escalated to “military confrontation” and the passivity with which some Russian military personnel have accepted the mercenary uprising suggests that they accept it, according to the report.\n\nThe head of the Wagner mercenary organization, Yevgeny Prigozhin, has declared his rebellion against the Russian military leadership on Saturday after accusing the Armed Forces of bombing one of his camps.

After months of insults and veiled accusations that he had been outgunned in the Battle of Bakhmut, Prigozhin recorded a video on Thursday in which he accused the minister of lying about Russia’s “successful” defense on the Zaporizhzhia front. “A huge amount of territory is lost. Soldiers have been killed, three, four times more than what it says in documents shown to the top,” said the Wagner Group chief.\n\nBefore Prigozhin announced a halt to the march, the Head of the Chechen Republic Ramzan Kadyrov broke his silence and placed his Praetorian Guard at the Kremlin’s disposal. “The fighters of the Ministry of Defense and the Russian Guard in the Chechen Republic have already left for the zones of tension,” he said on Telegram. “We will do everything to preserve the unity of Russia and protect its statehood!

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert at causal reasoning."}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n### CONTEXT\n[Doc 1]\nTitle: Among the Insurrectionists at the Capitol\nContent: Right-wing extremists justify such inconsistency by assigning the epithet “oath-breaker” to anyone in uniform who executes his duties in a manner they dislike. It is not difficult to imagine how, once Trump is no longer President, his most fanatical supporters could apply this caveat to all levels of government, including local law enforcement. At the rally on December 12th, Nicholas Fuentes underscored the irreconcilability of a radical-right ethos and pro-police, pro-military patriotism: “When they go door to door mandating vaccines, when they go door to door taking your firearms, when they go door to door taking your children, who do you think it will be that’s going to do that? It’s going to be the police and the military.”\n\nDuring Trump’s speech on January 6th, he said, “The media is the biggest problem we have.” He went on, “It’s become the enemy of the people. . . . We gotta get them straightened out.” Several journalists were attacked during the siege. Men assaulted a Times photographer inside the Capitol, near the rotunda, as she screamed for help. After National Guard soldiers and federal agents finally arrived and expelled the Trump supporters, some members of the mob shifted their attention to television crews in a park on the east side of the building. Earlier, a man had accosted an Israeli journalist in the middle of a live broadcast, calling him a “lying Israeli” and telling him, “You are cattle today.” Now the Trump supporters surrounded teams from the Associated Press and other outlets, chasing off the reporters and smashing their equipment with bats and sticks.\n\nThere was a ritualistic atmosphere as the crowd stood in a circle around the piled-up cameras, lights, and tripods. “This is the old media,” a man said, through a megaphone. “This is what it looks like. Turn off Fox, turn off CNN.”\n\nOutside the Capitol, rioters surrounded news crews, chasing off the reporters and smashing their equipment with bats. Photograph by Balazs Gardi for The New Yorker\n\nAnother man, in a black leather jacket and wraparound sunglasses, suggested that journalists should be killed: “Start makin’ a list! Put all those names down, and we start huntin’ them down, one by one!”\n\n“Traitors to the guillotine!”\n\n“They won’t be able to walk down the streets!”\n\nThe radicalization of the Republican Party has altered the world of conservative media, which is, in turn, accelerating that radicalization. On November 7th, Fox News, which has often seemed to function as a civilian branch of the Trump Administration, called the race for Biden, along with every other major network. Furious, Trump encouraged his supporters to instead watch Newsmax, whose ratings skyrocketed as a result. Newsmax hosts have dismissed covid-19 as a “scamdemic” and have speculated that Republican politicians were being infected with the virus as a form of “sabotage.” The Newsmax headliner Michelle Malkin has praised Fuentes as one of the “New Right leaders” and the groypers as “patriotic.”\n\nAt the December 12th rally, I ran into the Pennsylvania Three Percent member whom I’d met in Harrisburg on November 7th. Then he had been a Fox News devotee, but since Election Day he’d discovered Newsmax. “I’d had no idea what it even was,” he told me. “Now the only thing that anyone I know watches anymore is Newsmax. They ask the hard questions.”\n\nIt seems unlikely that what happened on January 6th will turn anyone who inhabits such an ecosystem against Trump. On the contrary, there are already indications that the mayhem at the Capitol will further isolate and galvanize many right-wingers. The morning after the siege, an alternative narrative, pushed by Jones and other conspiracists, went viral on Parler: the assault on the Capitol had actually been instigated by Antifa agitators impersonating Trump supporters. Mo Brooks, an Alabama congressman who led the House effort to contest the certification of the Electoral College votes, tweeted, “Evidence growing that fascist ANTIFA orchestrated Capitol attack with clever mob control tactics.” (Brooks had warmed up the crowd for Trump on January 6th, with a speech whose bellicosity far surpassed the President’s. “Today is the day American patriots start takin’ down names and kickin’ ass!” he’d hollered.) Most of the “evidence” of Antifa involvement seems to be photographs of rioters clad in black. Never mind that, in early January, Tarrio, the Proud Boys chairman, wrote on Parler, “We might dress in all BLACK for the occasion.” Or that his colleague Joe Biggs, addressing antifascist activists, added, “We are going to smell like you, move like you, and look like you.”\n\nNot long after the Brooks tweet, I got a call from a woman I’d met at previous Stop the Steal rallies. She had been unable to come to D.C., owing to a recent surgery. She asked if I could tell her what I’d seen, and if the stories about Antifa were accurate. She was upset—she did not believe that “Trump people” could have done what the media were alleging. Before I responded, she put me on speakerphone. I could hear other people in the room. We spoke for a while, and it was plain that they desperately wanted to know the truth. I did my best to convey it to them as I understood it.\n\nLess than an hour after we got off the phone, the woman texted me a screenshot of a CNN broadcast with a news bulletin that read, “antifa has taken responsiblitly for storming capital hill.” The image, which had been circulating on social media, was crudely Photoshopped (and poorly spelled). “Thought you might want to see this,” she wrote.\n\nIn the year 2088, a five-hundred-pound time capsule is scheduled to be exhumed from beneath the stone slabs of Freedom Plaza. Inside an aluminum cylinder, historians will find relics honoring the legacy of Martin Luther King, Jr.: a Bible, clerical robes, a cassette tape with King’s “I Have a Dream” speech, part of which he wrote in a nearby hotel. What will those historians know about the lasting consequences of the 2020 Presidential election, which culminated with the incumbent candidate inciting his supporters to storm the Capitol and threaten to lynch his adversaries? Will this year’s campaign against the democratic process have evolved into a durable insurgency? Something worse?\n\nOn January 8th, Trump was permanently banned from Twitter. Five days later, he became the only U.S. President in history to be impeached twice. (During the Capitol siege, the man in the hard hat withdrew from one of the Senate desks a manual, from a year ago, titled “PROCEEDINGS OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE IN THE IMPEACHMENT TRIAL OF PRESIDENT DONALD JOHN TRUMP.”) Although the President has finally agreed to submit to a peaceful transition of power, he has admitted no responsibility for the deadly riot. “People thought that what I said was totally appropriate,” he told reporters on January 12th.\n\nHe will not disappear. Neither will the baleful forces that he has conjured and awakened. This is why iconoclasts like Fuentes and Jones have often seemed more exultant than angry since Election Day. For them, the disappointment of Trump’s defeat has been eclipsed by the prospect of upheaval that it has brought about. As Fuentes said on the “InfoWars” panel, “This is the best thing that can happen, because it’s destroying the legitimacy of the system.” Fuentes was at the Capitol riot, though he denies going inside. On his show the next day, he called the siege “the most awe-inspiring and inspirational and incredible thing I have seen in my entire life.”\n\nAt the heap of wrecked camera gear outside the Capitol, the man in the leather jacket and sunglasses declared to the crowd, “We are at war. . . . Mobilize in your own cities, your own counties. Storm your own capitol buildings. And take down every one of these corrupt motherfuckers.” Behind him, lights glowed in the rotunda. The sky darkened. At 8 p.m., Congress reconvened and resumed certifying the election. For six hours, Americans had held democracy hostage in the name of patriotism.\n\nThe storm might be here. ♦\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nThe Capitol was secured, and lawmakers reconvened to continue certification.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

There was nobody to help me,\" he said. \"It was just me and other bystanders. And I couldn't do anything.\"\n\nIn the aftermath of the crowd surge, questions have begun to surface over whether more police should've been dispatched to the area to help control the large crowds.

The #MeToo movement went viral, spurring a national and global discussion on the issue.\n\nMany women have since come forward with their experiences of being sexually harassed by colleagues and bosses, costing influential men in the entertainment industry and the media — including journalists here at NPR — their jobs.\n\nAnd yet, there has been little data collected on the national prevalence of sexual harassment, says Michele Decker, director of the women's health and rights program at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. As a result, many people have asked, \"Where's the evidence?\" she says.\n\nNow an online survey launched in January by a nonprofit called Stop Street Harassment offers some of that missing evidence. It found that 81 percent of women and 43 percent of men had experienced some form of sexual harassment during their lifetime.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThose numbers are much larger than suggested by other recent polls. Those polls used a more limited sample or narrower definitions of harassment, says Anita Raj, director of the Center on Gender Equity and Health at the University of California, San Diego, who analyzed the results of the new survey.\n\nThe new survey, on the other hand, included a larger, more nationally representative sample of men and women ages 18 and above, says Raj.\n\nThe survey also involved a broader definition of sexual harassment that includes the \"continuum of experiences\" that women face, she says.\n\nLoading...\n\nThat includes verbal forms of sexual harassment, like being catcalled or whistled at or getting unwanted comments of a sexual nature. It also includes physical harassment, cyber harassment and sexual assaults.\n\nThe results, released in a report Wednesday, show that 77 percent of women had experienced verbal sexual harassment, and 51 percent had been sexually touched without their permission. About 41 percent said they had been sexually harassed online, and 27 percent said they had survived sexual assault.\n\nThe report also looked into locations where people experienced harassment. The majority of women — 66 percent — said they'd been sexually harassed in public spaces. \"The public forums are where you see the more chronic experiences of sexual harassment,\" says Raj. These include verbal harassment and physical harassment, like touching and groping.\n\nHowever, 38 percent of women said they experienced sexual harassment at the workplace. Thirty-five percent said they had experienced it at their residence. These experiences are more likely to be assaults and the \"most severe forms\" of harassment, says Raj.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"The findings show that this is a pervasive problem and permeates all sectors of our lives,\" says Holly Kearl, the main author of the report. \"Most people who said they had experienced sexual harassment experienced it in multiple locations.\"\n\n\"Sexual harassment until more recently has been viewed as part and parcel of what people experienced,\" says Decker, who wasn't involved in the survey. As a result, public health researchers don't monitor it. \"It's often been dismissed, because it's considered not as egregious as sexual assault or rape.\"\n\nRape and sexual violence are closely monitored by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey. As a result, public health agencies and health workers are more aware of their prevalence and have been able to take steps to help victims and offer programs aimed at preventing sexual violence.\n\nThe new report shows that sexual harassment, too, is worth monitoring, says Decker. \"We want to know that we're responding to things that are prevalent and common, and this is showing that sexual harassment is really prevalent.\"\n\nLoading...\n\nOne of the most striking findings from the report is that there is a very clear \"gender differential,\" she says. While men experience sexual harassment as well, the prevalence is higher for women, as is the intensity of those experiences. It also shows that men are more frequently the perpetrators, she adds.\n\nKearl says she was surprised at how few of the victims confronted their harasser. Instead, they changed their own lives to avoid harassers and reduce their risks of being harassed.\n\n\"They were changing their routes or routines; they were changing jobs, or moving,\" says Kearl.\n\nThe report also shows that most victims suffer from anxiety and depression as well, just like victims of sexual violence. \"It shows how challenging it is to confront someone. You'd rather change your life than confront the harasser,\" she says.\n\nRaj says her own teenage daughter's experience illustrates this. A couple of years ago, her daughter stopped walking to the public library by herself after she was harassed by a group of boys.\n\nLoading...\n\n\"She was walking from her high school in a very privileged, affluent area, an area that most people would define as very safe,\" Raj recalls. \"As she was walking alone around 3 o'clock in the afternoon, there was a group of boys that started calling out to her and saying things like 'nice hips.' And it just made her feel so uncomfortable [that] she didn't walk alone anymore.\"\n\nLike Raj's daughter, most women (and men) first experience sexual harassment pretty early in life — during preteen or teenage years. \"That's really disconcerting,\" says Raj.\n\nSimilarly disconcerting is the fact that most victims don't report their experiences, says Decker. \"People don't even mention it to friends, families.\" And so, sexual harassment is \"thriving on the silence of women,\" granting impunity to perpetrators, she says.\n\nSome of that has been turned upside down by the #MeToo movement, because it broke that silence and made it more culturally acceptable to talk about sexual harassment.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"The next wave of this is to really understand ... what are the barriers to people being able to access reporting process?\" says Decker. \"How can we support people who want to report this if they so choose?\"\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nWomen used social media to share sexual harassment experiences in October 2017, leading to the #MeToo movement going viral.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Those poor people, all at similar ages to my grandchildren, they died anyway,” said Jung Si-hoon, a retiree and a church elder, who placed an old wooden cross at the makeshift altar.\n\n“What more should we say? We should pray for them and wish they rest in peace.”\n\nShops and cafés nearby were closed, and police cordoned off the site of the tragedy as they continued their investigations.\n\nSchools, kindergartens and companies around the country scrapped planned Halloween events. K-pop concerts and government briefings were also cancelled.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“The government will undertake a thorough investigation into what caused this accident and do its best to make necessary institutional changes so that such an accident is not repeated,” Prime Minister Han said as government officials met on the disaster.\n\n“Identification has been completed for all of the 154 deceased except one, and I believe it is time for follow-up measures such as funeral procedures to be carried out in earnest,” Han said. “We will do our best to provide necessary support by reflecting the opinions of the bereaved families as much as possible.”\n\nPresident Yoon Suk-yeol, who has declared a period of national mourning and designated Itaewon a disaster zone, visited a memorial altar outside the Seoul city hall with his wife on Monday to pay his respects to those who died. Former United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon was also among those expressing their condolences.\n\nThe crush of partygoers came as Itaewon, a symbol of freewheeling nightlife in the South Korean capital for decades, was beginning to recover from prolonged pandemic restrictions with new restaurants and shops opening.\n\nThe disaster is the worst in South Korea since the Sewol ferry sank in 2014, killing 304 people, most of them high school students.\n\nThe sinking of the Sewol and criticism of the official response sent shockwaves across South Korea, prompting widespread soul-searching over safety measures that are likely to be renewed in the wake of Saturday’s crush.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nWorld leaders, including Fumio Kishida, Joe Biden, and Xi Jinping, sent messages of condolence to President Yoon.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

He died in the crowd surge in Seoul on Saturday.\n\nFor Steve Blesi, an excruciating wait turned into an unimaginable loss.\n\nHis son Steven Blesi was in the area of the crushing crowd surge in Seoul on Saturday night. After the father, who lives in suburban Atlanta, heard the news about the tragedy, he called and texted frantically. He reached out to friends and government officials. And he went on Twitter, imploring anyone with news to come forward.\n\nOver the next three agonizing hours, some people provided what little information they had. Others pledged prayers. All offered hope.\n\n“Is there anything we can do to help?” one asked.\n\n“Please God, return this man’s son to him unharmed,” another said.\n\nI know you must be beside yourself. Praying your son is found just fine. — Leah (@Makeawish3) October 30, 2022\n\nAt 11:30 p.m., Mr. Blesi and his wife received a phone call from the U.S. Embassy in South Korea.\n\n“When they said, ‘Are you two sitting down?’ I knew what the answer was,” he said. His son, 20, a student at Kennesaw State University in Georgia who was about two months into a study abroad program, was one of the Americans who were among the more than 150 people who died in the Halloween celebration in the Itaewon nightlife district in Seoul. (Anne Gieske, a nursing student at the University of Kentucky studying in Seoul this semester, also died, the school said in a statement on Sunday.)\n\n“It was like it stabbed like a hundred million times simultaneously,” Mr. Blesi said, speaking by phone on Sunday as he drove to pick up his older son, Joey Blesi, from college in Alabama. “It was like your world just collapsing. It was numb and devastating all at the same time.”\n\nImage Steven Blesi, left, and his brother, Joey Blesi. They were best friends, their father said.\n\nAs he made the two-hour drive, Mr. Blesi said he could not stop worrying about Joey. Steven was the more outgoing sibling, he said. Joey was shyer, more introverted.\n\n“Steven and him were best friends,” Mr. Blesi said, “I’m just worried to death about him, about how he becomes a whole heart instead of half a heart.”\n\nSteven Blesi had been waiting for years for an opportunity to study abroad, his father said. He had a passion for international business, specifically in East Asia, but the coronavirus pandemic had kept him from traveling there until this fall.\n\n“My wife is Latin, but he did not want to go to Latin America,” Mr. Blesi said, chuckling. “He was actually learning Korean in addition to Spanish. He wanted to speak more languages than my wife.” On Saturday, initial reports suggested that around 20 foreign nationals had been killed but that none of them were from the United States.\n\n“That gave us hope,” Mr. Blesi said.\n\nHe and his wife remained positive even after he tried calling his son repeatedly and someone else — a police officer — finally answered. Steven Blesi’s phone was among the scores of phones littered across the scene of the deadly crowd surge.\n\n“Well, maybe his phone got knocked out of his hand,” Mr. Blesi recalled thinking. “Maybe he lost his phone.”\n\nMr. Blesi was eventually able to piece together what happened to his son after getting in touch with some of his friends in Seoul. He had just finished taking midterm exams, and he and a group of friends were going out Saturday for a night of fun. They eventually found themselves at the Halloween celebration. A few of Steven Blesi’s friends left the gathering to escape the crowds, but he stayed behind.\n\n“I texted him maybe a half-hour before all this happened, and I said: ‘I know you’re out and about. Be safe,’” Mr. Blesi said. “I never got a reply to that.”\n\nBeyond the grief, Mr. Blesi said that he felt rage toward the authorities who he believes allowed this to happen.\n\nThey should not allow crowds to get that big, he said. “I see politicians out there grieving on Twitter,” he said. “It’s just, to me, publicity on their end. Whereas they should be working to try to ensure rules are in place to not allow this type of crowding to ever happen again.”\n\nMr. Blesi and others who knew his son agreed that his defining feature was the compassion he had for others, especially people who were struggling. He was never afraid to stand up for someone in need, Mr. Blesi said. He loved traveling and basketball, and he and his older brother were both Eagle Scouts.\n\n“He was an adventurous spirit and a loving spirit,” Mr. Blesi said. “That’s the only way I know how to describe him. And the loss is just unbearable.”\n\nAfter he posted the confirmation of his son’s death on Twitter, the responses kept coming.\n\n“May he rest in fun-filled, painless places,” one person said.\n\n“Heartbroken,” said another.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nPresident Yoon Suk-yeol declared a period of national mourning and designated Itaewon a disaster zone.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

As J. Michael Geringer, an international strategy expert and O’Bleness Professor of International Strategy in the College of Business explains, China has a history of banning or regulating U.S. tech companies like Meta and Google. He notes the U.S. government’s actions could be seen as a reciprocal move in this ongoing geopolitical rivalry.\n\n“From the standpoint of the U.S. threatening the same thing, that ‘If you aren’t abiding by our concerns, then we are going to impose these constraints’—that's not unique,” he says. “So, I think from that standpoint, there is precedent for it…. Will it help relations between the countries? Certainly not.”\n\nGeringer notes that the TikTok ban fits into a broader pattern of geopolitical competition and suggests that the ban could lead to diplomatic tensions with China and might prompt some form of retaliatory response.\n\n“Is it something that's going to cause World War III? I don't believe so,” he says, suggesting the target might be a corporation like “Apple, or limiting one of the other [U.S.] companies on what they can do if they're collecting information or operating in China.”\n\nGeringer concurred with Mourning’s assessment that whether TikTok becomes unavailable or merely less stable thanks to a ban, users will seek other platforms.\n\n“People are still going to demand social media. They're going to demand content. And [users] are going to go somewhere,” he says.\n\nAmid this week’s uncertainty around a Supreme Court decision, millions of TikTok users have started migrating to Rednote (Xiaohongshu), another Chinese-owned platform, raising further questions about whether a ban would truly mitigate risks. Geringer notes the impacts of a TikTok ban on U.S. market share might create a ripple effect on retaliation in other sectors, as well.\n\n“China is one of the top economies of the world. This [market share] is important whether it's going to be in social media or in other sectors. You know, smartphones, chips, computers, whatever—it's going to be about whether you're missing out on this very large market. That could be quite substantial.”\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nOn January 20, 2025, President Donald Trump sought to delay enforcement of the 2024 law banning TikTok distribution, intending to work out a divestment deal.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Climate change threatens joint efforts\nContent: As flames engulfed swaths of Los Angeles County this month and U.S. fire authorities scrambled to coordinate help from overseas, one longtime firefighting partner was left off their list: Australia .\n\nMexico and Canada both sent personnel and equipment to the front lines, and the Australian government publicly offered to help as part of a long-standing agreement with the United States.\n\nBut U.S. officials never requested it.\n\nThey knew that Australia, heading into its own fire season, was already dealing with a recent fire in Victoria state that burned more than 187,800 acres and took 21 days to contain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Requests for international assistance are typically sent first to the countries experiencing the least wildfire activity as they are more likely to be able to send firefighters and equipment,” said Erin McDuff, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of the Interior’s Office of Wildland Fire.\n\n“Australia, in particular, has recently experienced numerous severe wildfires that have taxed their available firefighting resources.”\n\nYet the absence of Australian help amid two of the most destructive fires in California’s history speaks to the increasing fragility of such international agreements in the age of climate change.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor more than 20 years, the agreement between the U.S. and Australia has operated on a simple principle: Located in opposite hemispheres, the two countries’ fire seasons have historically been asynchronous, allowing the side with less fire activity to send firefighting personnel or equipment to the other.\n\nBut climate change is extending fire seasons across the world, spreading existing resources thin. Many now fear that the system of cooperation is beginning to crack.\n\n“Resource-sharing agreements are becoming absolutely vital as countries are affected by prolonged outbreaks of extreme wildfires,” said Rick McRae, a wildfire management expert at the University of New South Wales Canberra.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“But if you look at California alone, there’s just been a continuous run of bad events,” he said. “The usual concept of fire seasons has had to be abandoned.”\n\n: :\n\nWould more help from Australia have made a difference?\n\nSome experts have said the sheer intensity and speed of the fires rendered it pointless to simply throw more people and equipment into the mix. Even with more than 10,000 firefighters battling the flames, ground crews in L.A. have said they were overwhelmed, and planes that spray fire retardant were often hamstrung by the winds.\n\n“If we had 100 air tankers there, would it have done any good? I don’t know. Maybe not,” said Joel Kerley, the chief executive of 10 Tanker, an Albuquerque-based aerial firefighting company contracted by the U.S. Forest Service to combat the L.A.-area fires.\n\n“But I’m at a point right where you gotta try. We are getting our butts kicked by these fires, and something has to change.”\n\nHector Cerna, 39, of Palmdale works to put out hot spots in Alpine National Park, in Australia’s Victoria state, on Jan. 18, 2020. The U.S. sent firefighters to help combat fires in Australia as part of a mutual aid agreement between the two countries. (Carolyn Cole / Los Angeles Times)\n\nKerley knows the difference that international assistance can make.\n\nA former aviation manager at the Interior Department’s Bureau of Indian Affairs, he was one of the 200 federal firefighters the U.S. sent to help Australia five years ago during a catastrophic series of bushfires known as Black Summer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was the traditional low season for wildfires in the western U.S., and the crews were returning a favor from two years earlier, when Australia and New Zealand sent over 138 people to help fight fires in Northern California in August.\n\nThe Black Summer fires burned through 60 million acres, destroying over 2,700 homes and killing at least 34 people. Kerley had arrived at the peak in December 2020 to find his Australian counterparts, most of whom were volunteers, barely hanging on.\n\n“None of them had days off,” he said. “They were exhausted, and we just provided relief for them to get some rest.”\n\nIt was a textbook example of the U.S.-Australia arrangement working as intended. But the L.A. fires have upended this model of seasonal exchange, with detrimental implications for other countries too.\n\nThe majority of Kerley’s DC-10s normally undergo maintenance during the winter, with one or two made available to respond to requests from South America. This week, he has calls with Argentina and Ecuador , which are battling intense wildfires, but he already knows he has to turn them down.\n\n“The international competition for resources that’s going on right now — that’s a real problem that needs to be addressed,” he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“There’s just simply not enough to go around.”\n\n: :\n\nIn Australia, this realization has already set in.\n\nIn October 2020, a royal commission launched in the wake of Black Summer recommended that the country build up its own fleet of firefighting planes.\n\n“The severity of the 2019-2020 bushfires highlighted the difficulties in obtaining additional aircraft from overseas at short notice,” the report said, noting that nearly every large air tanker used in those fires had been contracted from overseas.\n\n“The use of northern hemisphere-based firefighting aircraft is becoming problematic as the bushfire season is extending in both hemispheres, making it difficult to call on additional resources from overseas.”\n\nMany now say it is time for the U.S. to stop relying on foreign help and thinking of firefighting as seasonal work.\n\n“The U.S. wildland fire workforce was largely built on the foundation of seasonal workers,” said Robin Wills, who recently retired as chief of fire and aviation at the National Park Service’s Pacific West Region. “Many key firefighting resources, like federal hand crews and aviation assets, are unstaffed in the winter.”\n\nHe said that as fire seasons get longer with a warming climate, it is clear that this system has become outdated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Fire staff today commonly work 1,000 hours of overtime by September,” he said. “My crews have been away from home for 90 to 100 days. These firefighters are in need of rest and recovery and will likely be unavailable for large fires in January.”\n\nA contingent of American firefighters gather for a briefing before heading out on assignment on Jan. 18, 2020. They have joined Australian counterparts in battling flames at Alpine National Park. (Carolyn Cole / Los Angeles Times)\n\nThese problems are compounded by the drain of staff at federal agencies such as the Forest Service and Department of the Interior, which together hire most of the country’s firefighters.\n\nThe U.S. Forest Service recently lost 45% of its permanent employees over a three year-period, ProPublica reported last year, attributing the decline to low pay and difficult working conditions. Despite efforts from federal agencies to transition to a more permanent, year-round workforce, some are leaving for better-paying jobs in the private firefighting industry .\n\nThe situation in California is especially dire: Fire chiefs in the state have said that many Forest Service stations there are sitting empty because there is nobody available to oversee them, The Times reported last year.\n\n: :\n\nEven as firefighters make progress in L.A., Kerley, of 10 Tanker, said that the response there has not been a sustainable one.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“It puts pilots in an unsafe position,” he said.\n\nAfter three months without flying, his pilots were suddenly sent to what he called the “Super Bowl” of aerial firefighting, battling 40-mph crosswinds at a time when they would normally be heading into training for yearly recertification. He said some told him that it was “some of the most difficult flying that they’ve ever done in their careers.”\n\n“Firefighting needs to be a year-round job and a professional organization just like the U.S. military,” Kerley said. “We want 365-day coverage. So what does that look like? What is that going to cost? How do we do that? That is the first question to ask.”\n\nCould the L.A. fires be America’s Black Summer — the wake-up call he says the U.S. desperately needs?\n\nKerley hopes so.\n\n“If this isn’t the Pearl Harbor moment of wildland firefighting, I don’t know what is,” he said.\n\nTimes staff writer Kim reported from Seoul and special correspondent Petrakis from Melbourne.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nAustralia's military deployed ships and aircraft to rescue thousands trapped by fires.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Groups in China and South Korea have also raised concern, making it a political and diplomatic issue.\n\nBut the Japanese government and TEPCO say the water must be released to make room for the plant's decommissioning and to prevent accidental leaks. They say the treatment and dilution will make the wastewater safer than international standards and its environmental impact will be negligibly small. But some scientists say long-term impact of the low-dose radioactivity that remains in the water needs attention.\n\nThe water release begins more than 12 years after the March 2011 nuclear meltdowns, caused by a massive earthquake and tsunami. It marks a milestone for the plant's battle with an ever-growing radioactive water stockpile that TEPCO and the government say have hampered the daunting task of removing the fatally toxic melted debris from the reactors.\n\nThe pump activated Thursday afternoon would send the first batch of the diluted, treated water from a mixing pool to a secondary pool, where the water is then discharged into the ocean through an undersea tunnel. The water is collected and partly recycled as cooling water after treatment, with the rest stored in around 1,000 tanks, which are already filled to 98% of their 1.37-million-ton capacity.\n\nThose tanks, which cover much of the plant complex, must be freed up to build the new facilities needed for the decommissioning process, officials said.\n\nPrime Minister Fumio Kishida said it is indispensable and and cannot be postponed. He noted an experimental removal of a small amount of the melted debris from the No. 2 reactor is set for later this year using a remote-controlled giant robotic arm.\n\nTEPCO executive Junichi Matsumoto said Thursday's release was to begin with the least radioactive water to ensure safety.\n\nFinal preparation for the release began Tuesday, when just one ton of treated water was sent from a tank for dilution with 1,200 tons of seawater, and the mixture was kept in the primary pool for two days for final sampling to ensure safety, Matsumoto said. A batch of 460 tons was to be sent to the mixing pool Thursday for the actual discharge.\n\nBut Fukushima's fisheries, tourism and economy — which are still recovering from the disaster — worry the release could be the beginning of a new hardship.\n\nFukushima's current fish catch is only about one-fifth its pre-disaster level, in part due to a decline in the fishing population. China has tightened radiation testing on Japanese products from Fukushima and nine other prefectures, halting exports at customs for weeks, Fisheries Agency officials said.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nTEPCO began releasing the first batch of treated radioactive water into the Pacific Ocean.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA. South Korea banned seafood imports from the Fukushima area.\nB. Japan announced its plan to release treated Fukushima wastewater into the sea.\nC. Fishermen, including Haruo Ono, sued the Japanese government to stop the water release.\nD.

Explosives experts say it was one of the biggest non-nuclear explosions of all time; even Lebanon's neighboring countries felt the strength of the blast.\n\nFollowing the explosion, the ubiquitous sound of shattered glass being swept away became a discordant anthem of Beirut's grief. Thousands of volunteers from all over Lebanon and its diaspora flooded the affected areas, armed with shovels to clear rubble and wreckage blocking the streets and offering accommodation to hundreds of thousands who'd lost their homes. For the elderly and vulnerable, they fixed broken doors and windows.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nHussein Kazoun, 28, an organic farmer and the owner of a produce delivery company, sips instant coffee, enjoying his first break since he began his volunteer shift at 7 a.m. He hasn't made money in weeks, and he doesn't know when he will be able to return to his business.\n\nBut, he says, his work as a volunteer is more important: \"Lebanese people have to help each other in the absence of a functioning state.\"\n\nKazoun is a cofounder of Nation Station — an abandoned gas station converted into a disaster relief community center. The center serves the residents of Geitawi, a neighborhood overlooking the port that was badly damaged in the blast. It is just one of many initiatives by young Lebanese citizens determined to rebuild a capital city devastated by years of official negligence.\n\nThe state, paralyzed by corruption, mismanagement and the country's economic collapse, has been conspicuously absent following the Aug. 4 blast. While in most other countries, the government would have led an emergency response, in Lebanon, volunteers and nongovernmental organizations have taken things into their own hands and are leading the way.\n\nAlthough the Lebanese Army distributed boxes of food aid last week — rice, lentils and powdered milk donated by foreign countries — many volunteers slammed the move as a one-time publicity stunt. In most cases, government critics say, soldiers and police have done little, as volunteers and nonprofit workers have rushed to aid those affected by the blast.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Nada Homsi for NPR Nada Homsi for NPR\n\nThe Lebanese state, already bankrupt and suffering from an economic meltdown, has few social safety nets for Lebanese in need.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nNation Station was established the morning after the explosion, with Kazoun distributing free produce to Geitawi's residents. Other volunteers soon joined, offering their own services. They wired electricity throughout the dilapidated gas station, installed WiFi and created shift schedules. They formed cleanup crews, home repair crews, aid distribution teams, a hot meal kitchen, and set up a free secondhand clothing area in the gas station's parking lot.\n\nThree weeks later, it remains a bustling neighborhood center, where up to 150 volunteers have created their own functioning version of Lebanon — itself a form of protest against an increasingly dystopian reality.\n\nGerard Bitar, 25, a DJ and sound engineer, is on a technical team repairing electricity in damaged homes. Eager to help after he lost his own home in the blast, he says he picked up the electrical trade \"like, two weeks ago.\" Mostly, he says, volunteering helps distract him from thinking about the explosion.\n\n\"They killed us, man,\" he says of Lebanon's politicians.\n\nConfidence in Lebanon's ruling class was already wearing thin after years of political corruption and mismanagement brought the country to economic ruin last year, plunging more than 50% of the population below the poverty line, the World Bank estimates.\n\nInflation has soared, Lebanon's middle class has slowly disappeared, businesses have shuttered and unemployment is high. Lebanon's power-holders have done little to stem the crisis or enact the reforms required for an international bailout. The political class — some of them former warlords who emerged from Lebanon's 15-year civil war as politicians — are known for ruthless power-mongering and self-preservation that have come at the expense of ordinary Lebanese.\n\nMany Lebanese see Beirut's port explosion — caused by 2,750 tons of explosive material left deteriorating in a warehouse for nearly seven years — as the culmination of decades of government negligence. Since the blast, it came to light that high-ranking politicians and government employees, including the president and former prime minister (who resigned after the explosion), had previous knowledge of the haphazardly stored explosive material but made little effort to remove it.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nA makeshift gallows of metal wreckage stands at the entrance of Nation Station, from which hangs a noose made of electrical cables — a popular symbol of Lebanese outrage against politicians. On a sweltering Wednesday afternoon, volunteers gather in the shade to rest between shifts, while others load supplies onto motorbikes headed for the homes of vulnerable people. Neighborhood residents stop by to pick up hot meals. Many come to request medicine for wounds sustained in the blast and for preexisting illnesses.\n\nAntoine Kalab, a 27-year-old graduate student, walks the streets of Geitawi, surveying homes. He was in London when the explosion took place. Like many Lebanese in the diaspora, he watched in horror as footage aired of Beirut's sky turning red, followed by a mushroom cloud that expanded to envelop half the capital.\n\nFive days later, angry and under no illusions that the Lebanese government would competently handle disaster relief, he arrived in Beirut and signed up to volunteer at Nation Station, joining a needs assessment team.\n\nWeeks after the blast, the disaster response has changed. Glass and debris have been cleared from most streets, and those who lost their homes have located temporary housing. Kalab jots down residents' needs: medicine, food, a new front door, free mental health counseling.\n\nOne resident, Mona Ass'ad Aramouneh, a retired nurse, lives with her 90-year-old diabetic mother, who cannot see or walk. The two women were in their rented apartment when the world around them exploded.\n\nMona's mother fell to the floor, the glass door of their balcony shattering over her head. Even now, she says, \"I'm still picking bits of glass out of my hair and feet.\"\n\nAramouneh managed to drag her mother out of harm's way, and, unable to carry her to the hospital (which, unbeknownst to her, had mostly been destroyed in the blast), bandaged her at home. The memory of it contorts her face. Neither she nor her mother can sleep at night, she says, and although their apartment wasn't severely damaged, the memory of the explosion has tarnished any love they had for it.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nWhen Kalab asks if any government aid has come their way, Aramouneh says: \"The government, helping? Not until catastrophe befalls them, until one of their own dies, will they realize the value of the Lebanese people, the poor people, those of us who have suffered.\"\n\nLater, on the walk back to Nation Station, Kalab says he plans to return to London. When the volunteer effort eventually fades, he says, Lebanon will hold no future for him.\n\n\"A country that requires you to die for it ... It's not a healthy country,\" he says, tearing up. Then he walks past the makeshift gallows, and back into the bustling gas station.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nThousands of volunteers from Lebanon and its diaspora cleared rubble, offered accommodation, and repaired homes in affected areas after the explosion.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Russian president Vladimir Putin gave a televised speech, calling Prigozhin a traitor who was “stabbing Russia in the back”.\n\nRussian president Vladimir Putin gave a televised speech calling Prigozhin a traitor. Picture: Getty Images\n\nIt seemed that a real coup attempt was underway and Putin’s leadership was in real jeopardy. But, within 24 hours, it was all over and much of the world was left scratching their heads. Prigozhin had secured a deal for himself and his troops were heading back to their camps. What happened?\n\nPolitics & Society How Putin is devising his exit plan\n\nThe Prigozhin affair was neither a serious coup nor challenge to President Vladimir Putin’s authority. It was instead Prigozhin’s attempt to secure his own position in his ongoing feud with the Minister for Defence, Sergei Shoigu. The whole thing reveals a much deeper truth about Putin’s Russia: the weakness of mechanisms for peacefully resolving high-level, intra-elite disputes. As the war in Ukraine drags on, this creates an increasingly dangerous situation for Putin and the stability of the Russian state.\n\nResolving elite disputes\n\nWhy are there no regularised mechanisms for resolving intra-elite disputes in modern Russia?\n\nHead of the Wagner Group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, leaving the Southern Military District headquarters in Rostov-on-Don. Picture: Getty Images\n\nRussia has strong similarities to the ‘dual state’ in Nazi Germany. In the German ‘prerogative’ state, disputes were resolved by Adolph Hitler and the Nazi Party through methods unchecked by any legal or institutional guarantees. In the ‘normative’ state, by contrast, courts resolved non-politically charged disputes according to the law. The dualist state had evolved to allow Hitler and the Nazi Party to exercise their unlimited prerogative power in high-level disputes. But in matters that did not directly involve high level, political interests, the old ‘normative’ state continued to operate.\n\nPolitics & Society Why the war in Ukraine is so hard to stop\n\nThe Nazi party needed this normative state to predictably and reasonably regulate commercial disputes; it is next to impossible to organise a large system of market capitalism where there is no underlying consensus and trust among stakeholders on the predictability of outcomes if these vary from case to case. Contemporary Russia has evolved in a similar direction. Putin and his supporters use the prerogative state to ensure that they have unchecked power to settle disputes that threaten their power. But, in other disputes that do not make the headlines or impact major political players, legal institutions still function. Political scientist Professor Peter Solomon writes that “the cases that matter [politically] represent a small minority of the total, and most cases are handled fairly and expeditiously”.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin with long-serving Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu. Picture: Getty Images\n\nThe prigozhin affair\n\nThe ‘Prigozhin affair’ grew out of an intensifying intra-elite feud between Prigozhin and the Minister for Defence, Sergei Shoigu. This kind of elite feuding is highly common in Putin’s Russia. In fact, elite splits enhance Putin’s power by decreasing the possibility of a strong challenge to his power and making him the ultimate arbiter.\n\nPolitics & Society The past is never in the past\n\nFor months, Prigozhin knew he could get away with this criticism because he was useful to the war effort. His contributions to the war – and particularly the role of his private military company Wagner in the capture of Bakhmut – gave him leverage that guaranteed his safety. But, in recent weeks, it appeared that he was losing this leverage. In the days before his ‘mutiny’, Prigozhin found out that his private military company (Wagner) would be absorbed into the Russian military. Rumours were also swirling around that Prigozhin would soon be arrested and put in jail. Seeing his position weakening, Prigozhin – a convicted criminal who served time in prison – understood the logic of the prerogative state. There were no regularised ways of defending his position.\n\nThe Russian army was caught off guard by the Wagner Group forces who seized a key Russian city. Picture: Getty Images\n\nThe best lawyers in Russia could not save him. Any criminal proceeding against him would be pre-determined and a mere formality before a very long jail sentence. In the end, the currency of the Russian prerogative state was force and power. He had to flex his power while he still had it. His march on Moscow was therefore not a coup meant to challenge Putin or topple the Russian state. In fact, his public statements carefully avoided criticising Putin. His actions were instead a way to protect his own interests. And they paid off.\n\nPolitics & Society Five things to know about Russia’s Constitutional amendments\n\nThe Russian army was caught off guard and his forces were able to seize a key Russian city (and military hub) in the south and begin to move toward Moscow. But throughout, all sides avoided serious confrontation; it looked like everyone understood what was happening. Prigozhin was manouvering for a deal. And he got one.\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\nThe ‘Prigozhin affair’ shows the changing nature of Russia’s dual state. Since the war started, the Russian prerogative state has expanded. This has advantaged Putin and his supporters by allowing them more space to crack down on opposition to the regime. Perhaps the best example is a blatantly unconstitutional law that has been used to punish thousands of Russians for criticising the war.\n\nIn this environment, intra-elite disputes are far more dangerous than they were before.

Courtesy TV Asahi\n\nThe start of the release on Thursday afternoon sparked a fiery tirade from China which described the operation as a “selfish and irresponsible act.”\n\nChina’s customs department then announced it would stop importing all aquatic products originating from Japan – meaning the ban could potentially limit other oceanic products besides seafood such as sea salt and seaweed.\n\nThe move was aimed at preventing “the risk of radioactive contamination of food safety caused by Japan’s Fukushima nuclear contaminated water discharge,” and to protect the health of Chinese consumers, the customs department said in its statement.\n\nJapan has argued throughout the building controversy that discharging the treated water is safe and urgently needed to free up space at the crippled nuclear power plant.\n\nThe discharge began 1 p.m. local time (midnight ET), according to state-owned electricity firm Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO).\n\nThe treated radioactive wastewater will be highly diluted and released slowly over decades, said Japanese authorities. Courtesy TV Asahi\n\nThe company said it expects to discharge only around 200 or 210 cubic meters of treated wastewater. From Friday, it plans to then continuously release 456 cubic meters of treated wastewater over a 24-hour period and a total of 7,800 cubic meters over a 17-day period.\n\nTEPCO said that the operation would be suspended immediately and an investigation conducted if any abnormalities are detected in the discharge equipment or the dilution levels of the treated wastewater.\n\nIt will send a boat later Thursday into the harbor to collect samples to monitor and ensure the discharged treated wastewater meets international safety standards.\n\nJapan’s devastating 2011 earthquake and tsunami caused water within the Fukushima nuclear plant to be contaminated with highly radioactive material. Since then, new water has been pumped in to cool fuel debris in the reactors, while ground and rainwater have leaked in, creating more radioactive wastewater.\n\nThe plan to release the water has been in the works for years, with authorities warning in 2019 that space was running out to store the material and they had “no other options” but to release it in a treated and highly diluted form.\n\nA controversial decision\n\nWhile some governments have expressed support for Japan, others have strongly opposed the wastewater release, with many consumers in Asia hoarding salt and seafood amid fears of future contamination.\n\nThe US has backed Japan, and Taiwan has agreed that the amount of tritium being released should have “minimal” impact.\n\nHowever, China and the Pacific Islands have been vocal in their opposition, arguing the release could have broad regional and international impact, and potentially threaten human health and the marine environment.\n\nBefore China announced the seafood ban on Thursday, its foreign affairs ministry said the wastewater release would “pass on the risks to the whole world and extend the pain to future generations of humankind.”\n\nChinese social media was also awash in anger and dismay on Thursday, with a hashtag about the release gaining more than 800 million views on Weibo in just a few hours.\n\nMany users supported the seafood ban, while others called on authorities to take it a step further. “We should ban all Japanese products,” read one top comment.\n\nMany people in China continue to hold ambivalent feelings toward Japan. Despite the popularity of Japanese products and culture in China, calls to boycott all things Japanese are not uncommon whenever old grievances, triggered by current bilateral disputes, re-emerge.\n\nIn 2012, a series of anti-Japanese protests in cities across China turned violent after Japan decided to nationalize a group of islands in the East China Sea claimed by both Tokyo and Beijing.\n\nThe total ban on Japanese aquatic products and seafood expands on previous regulations that had already halted imports from Fukushima and nine other regions of Japan. Earlier this week, Hong Kong announced a similar ban on food imported from parts of Japan.\n\nBoth places – mainland China and Hong Kong – represent Japan’s top two biggest export markets for seafood, according to Japanese custom data, spelling potential trouble for the Japanese fishing industry.\n\nDespite the backlash, Japanese authorities and their international supporters, including the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog, argue the release is safe.\n\nOver the years, the wastewater has been continually treated to filter out all the removable harmful elements, then stored in tanks. Much of the water is treated a second time, according to TEPCO.\n\nWhen the wastewater is finally released, it will be heavily diluted with clean water so it has only very low concentrations of radioactive material. It will travel through an undersea tunnel about 1 kilometer (0.62 miles) off the coast, into the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThird parties will monitor the discharge during and after its release – including the UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).\n\nThe IAEA has staff stationed in a newly-opened Fukushima office and will monitor the situation for years to come, it said.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nThe Japanese government allocated $200 million to compensate the fishing industry and $340 million for local economic mitigation.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida announced Japan would begin discharging treated radioactive water from the Fukushima Daiichi plant into the sea as early as Thursday.\nB.

Mattingly, Polantz and Sneed write:\n\nThe top civil servant at the Treasury Department, David Lebryk, is leaving unexpectedly after Trump-affiliated officials expressed interest in stopping certain payments made by the federal government, according to three people familiar with the situation.\n\nAccording to one person familiar with the department, Trump-affiliated employees had asked about Treasury’s ability to stop payments. But Lebryk’s pushback was, “We don’t do that,” the person said.\n\n“They seem to want Treasury to be the chokepoint on payments, and that’s unprecedented,” the person added, emphasizing that it is not the bureau’s role to decide which payments to make — it is “just to make the f-ing payments.”\n\nMusk claims to be reclaiming government for you, the taxpaying voter\n\n“This is the critical battle to restore power to the PEOPLE from the massive unelected bureaucracy!” he wrote on the social media platform he owns, pushing people to rally at events opposing the use of taxpayer dollars to fund NGOs, nonprofits unaffiliated with the government that are supposed to do good works.\n\nThink Catholic Relief Services, the World Food Program and Save the Children. There can be a legitimate debate about whether the US should fund those programs in part because we know, thanks to transparency, that the US government is funding those programs.\n\nBut his method of taking over the bureaucracy is much less transparent than the bureaucracy itself.\n\nWhen Bill Clinton offered buyouts to federal workers, in 1993, for instance, he did so after getting buy-in from Congress. Trump’s administration is banking on a slim majority of Republicans in the House buying in to his plan, assuming they get a chance to have a say.\n\nMusk allies now in the government’s HR office\n\nThe New York Times and others reported this week that three former Musk employees have taken top positions at the Office of Personnel Management, the formerly obscure HR department for the federal government. It was OPM that first created a government-wide email system and then blasted it with an offer to millions of federal workers giving them the option to resign with pay until September. The offer caught federal workers off guard and unions and government watchdogs have said it is illegal.\n\nOPM confirmed to me that Amanda Scales, who used to work for Musk’s AI company xAI, is now chief of staff at OPM. Brian Bjelde, whose Linkedin profile still lists him as a SpaceX employee, is now a senior director, and so is Anthony Armstrong, a banker who worked with Musk to take over Twitter.\n\nThe New York Times report included other Musk allies in positions at other agencies, including the General Services Administration, which oversees federal real estate. Despite encouraging workers to return to the office, Musk also sees getting rid of government real estate or leases, and dispersing remaining workers throughout the country, as a cost saving technique.\n\nAre people getting fired next?\n\nTrump has twice referred to federal workers being fired if they’re not in offices after a February 6 deadline. “If they don’t agree by February 6 to show up back to work in their office, they will be terminated,” he said during a speech at the White House this week. There’s nothing in the resignation offer about people actively being fired in the near term.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Critics says Trump’s federal workforce buyout plan may not be legal 03:01 - Source: CNN Critics says Trump’s federal workforce buyout plan may not be legal 03:01\n\nMusk’s actual role is unclear\n\nWired reported he’s told friends he is sleeping at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, on the White House grounds. CNN has not confirmed the report, although it is similar to the story he told about his early days at Twitter and Tesla, when he proved his devotion to employees by sleeping at the office or on the factory floor. It’s either the ultimate commitment to working from home or the ultimate commitment to his job.\n\nOne outstanding question: Has he taken an oath, like the federal workers he apparently has plans to fire, to uphold the Constitution?\n\nWhat are Musk’s conflicts of interest?\n\nI asked Walter Shaub, the former Director of the Office of Government Ethics, who has raised warnings about Trump but also criticized Democrats, about the opacity of Musk’s role and why it should concern Americans.\n\n“The Trump administration owes the American people a detailed explanation as to precisely how it hopes to manage conflicts of interest, as well as whether it deems Musk and each of the other participants in DOGE as a volunteer, a special government employee or a regular government employee,” he said in an email.\n\nPeople are supposed to know about the people who run their government\n\nThat’s why Trump’s nominees to lead agencies have to undergo nomination hearings on Capitol Hill and why top officials are supposed to file paperwork with the Office of Government Ethics disclosing their financial interests and pledging to act ethically.\n\nThey’re supposed to know how their government is spending money and who is doing the spending. The mass resignation offer that caught everyone off guard was made under authority granted to the OPM director. Trump’s nominee, the venture capitalist Scott Kupor, has not yet been confirmed, so the agency is operating with an acting director.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nMusk laid out some ideas in the Wall Street Journal, back in November when he was working with Vivek Ramaswamy, who has left DOGE.\n\nMass firings? That plan presaged an effort to encourage workers to resign. What comes next, according to that Journal plan, is they will “identify the minimum number of employees required at an agency for it to perform its constitutionally permissible and statutorily mandated functions,” after which Trump could suspend worker protections to enforce a “mass head-count reductions across the federal bureaucracy.” One wonders how many air traffic controllers is the minimum number required.\n\nSteep spending cuts? They’re hoping to grab new power, with help from the Supreme Court, for the president to simply ignore Congress and not spend money, something called impoundment. They also wanted to cut $500 billion in spending by targeting things like public broadcasting and foreign aid. There’s already evidence of this plan in Trump’s since-rescinded order to halt federal grants.\n\nA hard look at Medicare? Some of the efforts should be welcome to Americans, like a long overdue examination of federal contracting and procurement. But don’t be surprised when it takes a hard look at Medicare spending, despite Trump’s pledge not to cut safety net spending. It’s all written out in the Journal.\n\nWhat’s not written is a public plan or a list of Musk allies now in the government. That is something everyone should want to take a look at.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nElon Musk gained full command of the federal cost-cutting effort.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA. Elon Musk contributed $277 million to Trump's and other Republicans' 2024 campaigns.\nB. David Lebryk departed his position at the Treasury Department.\nC.

Plus, the former has its annual revenue pegged comfortably at $115 billion – while the latter is at $6.7 billion only.\n\nA 17x gap – that’s not a competitive race, it’s a landslide. Even if AMD doubles its AI revenue, it remains a distant second only. That said, AMD stock has, nonetheless, soared nearly 85% over the past three months.\n\nAMD lacks ecosystem despite strong performance\n\nInvestors should note that Nvidia’s dominance in the AI data centre segment is reinforced by its full-stack ecosystem, including CUDA, TensorRT, and NeMo, which are deeply entrenched in enterprise and sovereign cloud deployments.\n\nWhile AMD is evidently improving its ROCm stack, it still suffers from fragmented adoption and limited developer tooling.\n\nIts latest MI355 chips do boast 288GB of HBM3E memory and impressive bandwidth, but Nvidia B200 and GB200 still outperform in sparse compute, software optimization, and, most importantly, real-world inference throughput.\n\nMoreover, Nvidia’s chips are backed by a mature developer ecosystem, with over 5 million CUDA developers and widespread adoption across hyperscalers like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud as well.\n\nIn short, Advanced Micro Devices may offer better tokens-per-dollar, but that metric alone doesn’t win enterprise contracts. NVDA’s ability to deliver turnkey AI infrastructure – from silicon to orchestration – gives it unmatched pricing power and margin leverage.\n\nNvidia vs. AMD shares: the gap is structural, not just technical\n\nHSBC’s optimism around AMD’s MI350 series is understandable – the chips are a genuine leap forward. But calling it a true rival to Nvidia in AI is a bit premature.\n\nAMD may be narrowing the performance gap with its new chips, but the ecosystem moat, market share dominance, and developer lock-in still favour NVDA by a wide margin.\n\nUntil AMD can match Nvidia’s full-stack integration and software defensibility, it remains only a challenger, not a peer. Therefore, investors should be cautious about extrapolating short-term performance gains into long-term market leadership.\n\nThe AI chip war sure is heating up, but Nvidia still holds the high ground. Finally, other Wall Street firms do not particularly agree with HSBC’s optimism on AMD shares either.\n\nWhile the consensus rating on AMD stock currently sits at “overweight”, the mean target of about $137 actually suggests potential “downside” of more than 5.0% from here.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nNvidia announced it is significantly increasing chip supply to meet surging demand.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA. Nvidia released its first-quarter earnings report, estimating $11 billion in second-quarter sales and reporting $1.09 earnings per share.\nB. The tech industry increased its focus on A.I., causing a shortage of chips.\nC. Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky, and Curtis Priem founded Nvidia in 1993.\nD.

An uncontrolled collapse of Credit Suisse would lead to incalculable consequences for the country and the international financial system.\"\n\nCredit Suisse is designated by the Financial Stability Board, an international body that monitors the global financial system, as one of the world’s globally systemic important banks. This means regulators believe its uncontrolled failure would lead to ripples throughout the financial system not unlike the collapse of Lehman Brothers 15 years ago.\n\nMarkets remain jittery despite the best efforts of regulators to restore calm. Shares fell Monday in Asia, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng index down 2.7% and Tokyo's benchmark Nikkei 225 losing 1.2%. Bank shares in the region were lower and futures in London and Frankfurt also fell.\n\nSunday's news conference follows the collapse of two large US banks last week that spurred a frantic, broad response from the US government to prevent any further bank panics. Still, global financial markets have been on edge since Credit Suisse's share price began plummeting this week.\n\nThe 167-year-old Credit Suisse already received a $50 billion (54 million Swiss francs) loan from the Swiss National Bank, which briefly caused a rally in the bank's stock price. Yet the move did not appear to be enough to stem an outflow of deposits, according to news reports.\n\nStill, many of Credit Suisse's problems are unique and do not overlap with the weaknesses that brought down Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, whose failures led to a significant rescue effort by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Reserve. As a result, their downfall does not necessarily signal the start of a financial crisis similar to what occurred in 2008.\n\nThe deal caps a highly volatile week for Credit Suisse, most notably on Wednesday when its shares plunged to a record low after its largest investor, the Saudi National Bank, said it wouldn't invest any more money into the bank to avoid tripping regulations that would kick in if its stake rose about 10%.\n\nFollowing news of the Swiss deal, the world’s central banks announced coordinated moves to stabilize banks, including access to a lending facility for banks to borrow U.S. dollars if they need them, a practice widely used during the 2008 crisis. Three months after Lehman Brothers collapsed in September of 2008, such swap lines had been tapped for $580 billion. Swap lines also were rolled out during market turmoil in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nColm Kelleher, the UBS chairman, hailed \"enormous opportunities\" from the takeover and highlighted his bank’s \"conservative risk culture\" – a subtle swipe at Credit Suisse's reputation for more swashbuckling gambles in search of bigger returns. He said the combined group would create a wealth manager with over $5 trillion in total invested assets.\n\nOn Friday, shares dropped 8% to close at 1.86 francs ($2) on the Swiss exchange. The stock has seen a long downward slide: It traded at more than 80 francs in 2007.\n\nIts current troubles began after Credit Suisse reported on Tuesday that managers had identified \"material weaknesses\" in the bank’s internal controls on financial reporting as of the end of last year. That fanned fears that Credit Suisse would be the next domino to fall.\n\nWhile smaller than its Swiss rival UBS, Credit Suisse still wields considerable influence, with $1.4 trillion assets under management. The firm has significant trading desks around the world, caters to the rich and wealthy through its wealth management business, and is a major advisor for global companies in mergers and acquisitions. Notably, Credit Suisse did not need government assistance in 2008 during the financial crisis, while UBS did.\n\nDespite the banking turmoil, the European Central Bank on Thursday approved a large, half-percentage point increase in interest rates to try to curb stubbornly high inflation, saying Europe’s banking sector is \"resilient,\" with strong finances.\n\nECB President Christine Lagarde said the banks \"are in a completely different position from 2008\" during the financial crisis, partly because of stricter government regulation.\n\nThe Swiss bank has been pushing to raise money from investors and roll out a new strategy to overcome an array of troubles, including bad bets on hedge funds, repeated shake-ups of its top management and a spying scandal involving UBS.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nThe chairmen of Credit Suisse and UBS announced a union on March 19th in Bern.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA. Credit Suisse experienced major financial losses and scandals, including top executives resigning in 2020 due to a spying scandal, a court finding of failed money laundering prevention, and a loss of over 7 billion Swiss francs in 2022.\nB. The Swiss National Bank pledged a loan of up to 100 billion Swiss francs to support the takeover.\nC. Swiss officials brokered an emergency takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS Group AG.\nD.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert at causal reasoning."}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n### CONTEXT\n[Doc 1]\nTitle: The Texas Power Grid and the Failure of Deregulation\nContent: By now, the early message that the electricity blackout in Texas was a failure of renewable energy has been replaced by the far more complex reality of a grid not prepared for extreme weather. Texas takes pride in its free market–fueled economic environment that provides low-cost housing, cheap electricity, and plenty of personal transportation along with low taxes. The problem is that the absence of rules and governance can come back and create harm if you happen to live on a more crowded and complex planet, like the one we have here on Earth. Climate change, pandemics, traffic jams, toxic air, polluted water and poisoned land cannot be addressed by the free market alone. The market can be used to produce needed goods and services, but the idea that markets and civilization itself can survive without rules is absurd idiocy.\n\nTexas this past week was a case in point. The electric grid in Texas is built for efficiency, but it is not built for climate resilience. As Katherine Blunt and Russell Gold reported in the Wall Street Journal:\n\n“A fundamental flaw in the freewheeling Texas electricity market left millions powerless and freezing in the dark this week during a historic cold snap. The core problem: Power providers can reap rewards by supplying electricity to Texas customers, but they aren’t required to do it and face no penalties for failing to deliver during a lengthy emergency. That led to the fiasco that left millions of people in the nation’s second-most-populous state without power for days. A severe storm paralyzed almost every energy source, from power plants to wind turbines, because their owners hadn’t made the investments needed to produce electricity in subfreezing temperatures. While power providers collectively failed, the companies themselves didn’t break any rules.”\n\nThe quest for efficiency and low cost led to under-investment and energy facilities poorly prepared for cold weather. Texas does better in hot weather, but climate change is altering weather patterns and extreme weather events are becoming more common. While we need to mitigate climate change and will need government-driven public policy to do that, we must also adapt to the climate change that is already underway. That need to adapt also requires a more active government presence than the ideologues running Texas want to allow.\n\nEnergy is not the only industry damaged by uncontrolled market forces. Health care is also suffering from the impact of health insurance companies on hospitals and medical care. The shortage of intensive care beds during the COVID-19 pandemic can be traced to efforts to enhance cost-effectiveness in hospitals. Extra capacity is considered waste that must be reflected in the price of care. Eliminate that capacity and costs can be reduced. Instead of paying for and storing extra personal protective equipment, hospitals utilize just-in-time supply chains to meet immediate needs. The system worked well until a pandemic hit and the supply chains could not meet dramatically increased demand.\n\nI am not arguing against just-in-time production or global supply chains, but rather for adequate public investment in infrastructure and supplies to meet the needs of emergencies. The public interest requires rules that may inhibit unfettered markets, but if regulations are designed with care, we can retain the benefits brought by the competitive marketplace. In some instances, we won’t need regulation but instead, require public infrastructure investment. For example, a more resilient electric grid could consist of thousands of microgrids knitted together into a national smart grid. Some of the capital for rebuilding the grid could come from federal infrastructure investment- the type needed to revive the American economy. The modern grid will produce energy at lower costs, making our economy more productive. A more robust system of public health will require enhanced local virus testing, tracing and isolation capacity and biological scanning of air travelers by the TSA. Travelers can fund the TSA, but local taxes will need to pay for local public health capacity.\n\nTo resume and maintain our way of life in a complex, interconnected global economy, we will need to develop a set of rules and build the institutional capacity needed to protect us from 21st-century threats. These range from terrorism to pandemics to the impact of extreme weather events. Our ability to enjoy the benefits of modern technology requires that public management become more effective and efficient. It is time to reject the idea that government is the problem and the solution to our problems is to “starve the beast” and disinvest in the public sector. That may have been an answer to some of the issues faced by Ronald Reagan and his contemporaries in 1980, but it is completely inadequate to the issues we are facing four decades later.\n\nDeregulation has failed. But reimposing rigid rules is unlikely to result in better outcomes. We need to develop incentives and disincentives that result in private behaviors that meet the requirements of the public interest. Some of that is pure command and control regulation. Every traffic system requires some traffic lights. But, tax credits and deductions, public investments, government-funded research and other forms of subsidies must be designed to achieve public ends rather than reward powerful interests. This will not be easy to do. We need to develop regulatory strategies that incentivize private behaviors to meet public needs. One size does not fit all, and we need to recognize that in formulating and implementing regulation.\n\nOur ability to measure performance is far greater than it was in the middle of the 20th century. The technology of observation, communication and information has advanced dramatically and can enable more targeted and effective rules. Remote sensing can replace human inspections and some auditing functions can be automated. We need to apply ingenuity and design to more effective and flexible policies and public investments. Effective public management requires financial investment, brainpower and political will. We should use the market to meet our needs rather than worship the market as the solution to all problems.\n\nA year of COVID-19 lockdown has demonstrated the inadequacy of what remains of our public sector. Our unwillingness to tax ourselves and invest in public sector infrastructure or organizational capacity has resulted in disease, death and trillions of dollars of economic damage. Last week in Texas, the free market in energy delivered cold and misery. For the past year, we have struggled to contain a virus that could have been isolated and eliminated with a more robust, competent system of public health. The benefits of modern technology bring costs. We need to understand those negative impacts and protect ourselves from them.\n\nIn a world where disinformation abounds and reality has become controversial, it will be a challenge to develop a more sophisticated, fact-based system of governance. A large number of Americans do not believe that our climate is changing and do not believe that COVID-19 is real. They think that Donald Trump’s reelection was stolen by nefarious forces and that the January 6th insurrection was led by Antifa. Despite these fact-free accounts, hundreds of insurrectionists are headed to courtrooms, thousands of COVID victims have died and millions of climate deniers in Texas suffered last week from the impact of climate-induced extreme weather. My hope is that Americans will accept reality and reject ideology. We need pragmatism and we need to be willing to pay the hand we are dealt. We saw signs of that in the recent election and in the poll data that indicates 70% of the country favors the Biden pandemic relief package. America’s government is a sleeping giant that seems to be slowly waking up from decades of slumber.\n\nViews and opinions expressed here are those of the authors, and do not necessarily reflect the official position of the Columbia Climate School, Earth Institute or Columbia University.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nOver 2 million Texas residents were left without electricity.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

Here’s how it unfolded\nContent: CNN —\n\nDays after President Donald Trump ordered a drone strike that killed Qasem Soleimani, the powerful commander of Iran’s elite Quds Force, the United States is bracing for possible retaliatory actions by Iran. The military adviser to Iran’s Supreme Leader told CNN on Sunday that Tehran will certainly strike back against US “military sites.”\n\nHere’s how tensions between the two nations have escalated in recent weeks:\n\nDecember 27\n\nA rocket attack on a base near Kirkuk, Iraq, killed a US civilian contractor and wounded several US and Iraq military personnel. A US official told CNN the United States saw similarities between the rocket attack and past attacks that have been linked to a Shiite militia in Iraq believed to be backed by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.\n\nDecember 29\n\nAccording to the Pentagon, US forces conducted airstrikes at five facilities in Iraq and Syria controlled by a Shiite military group known as Kataib Hezbollah. American officials have blamed the group for attacks on US-Iraq military facilities, including the one that killed the US civilian contractor two days earlier near Kirkuk.\n\nAt least 25 people were killed in the US airstrikes, the Popular Mobilization Units, a Tehran-backed Shiite militia also known as Hashd al-Shaabi, said in a statement.\n\nBefore the airstrikes, the United States had been pushed to the brink of retaliation against Iran or its proxies, specifically after attacks last summer on oil tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil facilities in Saudi Arabia and Iran’s downing of a US drone in June.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback US strikes 5 facilities in Iraq and Syria 02:17 - Source: CNN US strikes 5 facilities in Iraq and Syria 02:17\n\nDecember 31\n\nPro-Iranian protesters attacked the US Embassy in Baghdad, scaling walls and forcing the gates open. The protesters were demonstrating against the American airstrikes on the Iran-backed militia group in Iraq. Trump threatened Iran, warning the country’s leaders would be held responsible for any death or destruction after the attack.\n\nThe United States deployed 750 troops from a unit in Fort Bragg, North Carolina, to protect the embassy.\n\nProtesters stand on walls at the US Embassy in Baghdad on December 31. Khalid Mohammed/AP\n\nJanuary 3\n\nTrump said he ordered a precision drone strike at the Baghdad airport to “terminate” Soleimani, a top Iranian commander who was plotting “imminent and sinister attacks on Americans diplomats and military personnel.” Others were killed in the attack.\n\n“We took action last night to stop a war. We did not take action to start a war,” Trump said in a statement from his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.\n\nThe Pentagon has blamed Soleimani and his Quds Force for attacks on coalition bases in recent months, including the December 27 strike and the attack on the US Embassy in Baghdad. The United States began deploying thousands of additional troops to the Middle East – on top on the 750 – from the same unit in Fort Bragg as tensions mounted.\n\nThe deployment surprised some military families.\n\nMourners throng the car carrying the body of Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani during a funeral procession for Soleimani and Iraqi paramilitary leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis in Baghdad on January 4.

But the administration has yet to publicly explain the legal justification for killing Soleimani, leading Democratic lawmakers to question whether the President had the authority to order the strike without congressional approval.\n\nThe lack of evidence provided to lawmakers and the public has fueled skepticism about whether the strike was justified.\n\nThe President “has been reluctant to take military action,” but the killing of the US contractor late last month, the wounding of others and the protests at the US Embassy in Baghdad “crossed his line,” a Republican congressional source familiar with the administration’s decision to kill Soleimani told CNN.\n\nTrump vowed specific military action against Iran if it “strikes any Americans, or American assets.”\n\n“We have … targeted 52 Iranian sites (representing the 52 American hostages taken by Iran many years ago), some at a very high level & important to Iran & the Iranian culture” and “if Iran strikes any Americans, or American assets… Iran itself, WILL BE HIT VERY FAST AND VERY HARD,” Trump wrote in a series of tweets.\n\nWithin the Trump administration, there is widespread opposition to targeting cultural sites in Iran should the US launch retaliatory strikes against Tehran, two senior US officials said.\n\n....hundreds of Iranian protesters. He was already attacking our Embassy, and preparing for additional hits in other locations. Iran has been nothing but problems for many years. Let this serve as a WARNING that if Iran strikes any Americans, or American assets, we have..... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 4, 2020\n\n....targeted 52 Iranian sites (representing the 52 American hostages taken by Iran many years ago), some at a very high level & important to Iran & the Iranian culture, and those targets, and Iran itself, WILL BE HIT VERY FAST AND VERY HARD. The USA wants no more threats! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 4, 2020\n\nJanuary 5\n\nThousands flood the streets to mourn Iranian Gen. Qasem Soleimani and others killed in the Friday drone attack. Alireza Mohammadi/ISNA via AP\n\nSoleimani’s body arrived in his home country, where thousands mourned him.\n\nMeanwhile, Maj. Gen. Hossein Dehghan, the military adviser to Iran’s Supreme Leader, told CNN in an exclusive interview that Tehran’s response will “for sure be military.” Iran would retaliate directly against US “military sites,” Dehghan said in the most specific and direct threat yet by a senior Iranian official following the killing.\n\nIn the United States, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo backed Trump’s strong threat to Iran. “The American people should know that we will not waver,” he said.\n\nThe fallout continued in Iraq and Iran.\n\nIn Baghdad, parliament voted for the government to work on a plan to end the presence of US troops in Iraq. Trump on Sunday threatened sanctions on Iraq if US troops are expelled.\n\nIn Tehran, the government announced that it will no longer limit itself to the restrictions on uranium enrichment and research associated with nuclear operations set forth in 2015 by the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, according to a statement on state-run news agency IRNA.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nIran announced it would suspend compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal while continuing to work with IAEA inspectors.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA.

In the next three years, Huawei, the world’s second largest smartphone vendor, will look to bring HarmonyOS to more devices, including smartphones, he said.\n\nYu said, without offering any proof, that HarmonyOS is “more powerful and secure than Android.” He said HarmonyOS’ IPC performance is five times that of Google’s Fuchsia. The top executive also claimed that HarmonyOS’ microkernel has “one-thousandth the amount of code in the Linux kernel.”\n\n“A modularized HarmonyOS can be nested to adapt flexibly to any device to create a seamless cross-device experience. Developed via the distributed capability kit, it builds the foundation of a shared developer ecosystem,” the company said in a statement, adding that it began to explore developing its own operating system “as early as 10 years ago.”\n\nThe company said it intends to continue to use Android moving forward, but HarmonyOS is officially its back-up plan if things go south. “We will prioritize Android for smartphones, but if we can’t use Android, we will be able to install HarmonyOS quickly,” Yu said.\n\nThe availability of the mobile operating system, which is open source, will be limited to China for now, though the company has plans to bring it to international markets at a later stage, he said.\n\nThe company said it has worked on security and trustworthiness aspects of the operating system from the ground up. It said HarmonyOS uses formal verification methods to “reshape security.” Formal verification methods are an effective mathematical approach to validate system correctness from the source, while traditional verification methods, such as functional verification and attack simulation, “are confined to limited scenarios,” the company claimed.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $475 on your TechCrunch All Stage pass Build smarter.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\n\nThe announcement today comes months after the U.S. government put Huawei and more than 60 affiliates in an entity list, restricting U.S. firms from maintaining a business relationship with the Chinese giant. The U.S. government has accused Huawei of stealing trade secrets, and said it poses a risk to national security. Huawei has denied these accusations and pursued legal means to fight back.\n\nIn the aftermath, Google, Intel and other U.S.-based companies that contribute much of the technology and solutions that go into a smartphone suspended their business with Huawei, thereby severely questioning the company’s future prospects.\n\nThe ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China has already started to impact Huawei’s bottom line. The company’s performance in the quarter that ended in June was weak, compared to several previous quarters.\n\nWhat remains unclear is the kind of impact the U.S.’ accusations have had on the Chinese giant’s brand image worldwide. According to research firm Counterpoint, about half of all Huawei smartphones ship outside China.\n\nHuawei was poised to become the world’s biggest vendor by shipment — something it would have achieved — “if not for the trade war,” Yu said.\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nHuawei ensured HarmonyOS supports applications developed in multiple programming languages.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA. HarmonyOS development began in 2017.\nB. Huawei stated it will first lay the foundation for operating systems in the Chinese market, then expand overseas.\nC.

Truss, who said she will remain in office for a few more days while that process unfolds, has been prime minister for just 45 days.\n\nJust a day earlier she had vowed to stay in power, saying she was “a fighter and not a quitter.” But Truss couldn’t hold on any longer after a senior minister quit her government with a barrage of criticism and a vote in the House of Commons descended into chaos and acrimony just days after she was forced to abandon many of her economic policies.\n\nA growing number of lawmakers had called for Truss to resign after weeks of turmoil sparked by her economic plan. When it was unveiled by the government last month, the plan triggered financial turmoil and a political crisis that has seen the replacement of Truss’ Treasury chief, multiple policy U-turns and a breakdown of discipline in the governing Conservative Party.\n\nEarlier, Conservative lawmaker Simon Hoare said the government was in disarray.\n\n“Nobody has a route plan. It’s all sort of hand-to-hand fighting on a day-to-day basis,” he told the BBC on Thursday.\n\nTruss quit after a meeting with Graham Brady, a senior Conservative lawmaker who oversees leadership challenges. Brady was tasked with assessing whether the prime minister still has the support of Tory members of Parliament — and it seemed she did not.\n\n“It’s time for the prime minister to go,” Conservative lawmaker Miriam Cates said earlier Thursday. Another, Steve Double, said of Truss: “She isn’t up to the job, sadly.” Legislator Ruth Edwards said “it is not responsible for the party to allow her to remain in power.”\n\nLawmakers’ anger grew after a Wednesday evening vote over fracking for shale gas — a practice that Truss wants to resume despite opposition from many Conservatives — produced chaotic scenes in Parliament.\n\nWith Conservatives holding a large parliamentary majority, an opposition call for a fracking ban was easily defeated. But there were displays of anger in the House of Commons, with party whips accused of using heavy-handed tactics to gain votes.\n\nChris Bryant, a lawmaker from the opposition Labour Party, said he “saw members being physically manhandled … and being bullied.” Conservative officials denied there was manhandling.\n\nRumors swirled that Conservative Chief Whip Wendy Morton, who is responsible for party discipline, and her deputy had resigned. Hours later, Truss’ office said both remained in their jobs.\n\nNewspapers that usually support the Conservatives were vitriolic. An editorial in the Daily Mail was headlined: “The wheels have come off the Tory clown car.”\n\nInternational Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan, sent onto the airwaves Thursday morning to defend the government, insisted the administration was providing “stability.” But she was unable to guarantee Truss would lead the party into the next election.\n\n“At the moment, I think that’s the case,” she said.\n\nWith opinion polls giving the Labour Party a large and growing lead, the Conservative Party decided its only hope of avoiding electoral oblivion was to replace Truss. But they remain divided over who exactly should do that.\n\nThe party is keen to avoid another divisive leadership contest like the race a few months ago that saw Truss defeat ex-Treasury chief Rishi Sunak. Among potential replacements — if only Conservative lawmakers can agree — are Sunak, House of Commons leader Penny Mordaunt and newly appointed Treasury chief Jeremy Hunt.\n\nWhoever it is will be the country’s third prime minister this year alone. A national election doesn’t have to be held until 2024.\n\nTruss’ downfall was hastened by the resignation on Wednesday of Home Secretary Suella Braverman. She quit after breaching rules by sending an official document from her personal email account. She used her resignation letter to lambaste Truss, saying she had “concerns about the direction of this government.”\n\n“The business of government relies upon people accepting responsibility for their mistakes,” she said in a thinly veiled dig at Truss.\n\nBraverman was replaced as home secretary, the minister responsible for immigration and law and order, by former Cabinet minister Grant Shapps, a high-profile supporter of her defeated rival Sunak.\n\nThe dramatic developments came days after Truss fired her Treasury chief, Kwasi Kwarteng, on Friday after the economic package the pair unveiled Sept. 23 spooked financial markets and triggered an economic and political crisis.\n\nThe plan’s 45 billion pounds ($50 billion) in unfunded tax cuts sparked turmoil on financial markets, hammering the value of the pound and increasing the cost of U.K. government borrowing. The Bank of England was forced to intervene to prevent the crisis from spreading to the wider economy and putting pension funds at risk.\n\nOn Monday Kwarteng’s replacement, Hunt, scrapped almost all of Truss’ tax cuts, along with her flagship energy policy and her promise of no public spending cuts. He said the government will need to save billions of pounds and there are “many difficult decisions” to be made before he sets out a medium-term fiscal plan on Oct. 31.\n\nSpeaking to lawmakers for the first time since the U-turn, Truss apologized Wednesday and admitted she had made mistakes during her six weeks in office, but insisted that by changing course she had “taken responsibility and made the right decisions in the interest of the country’s economic stability.”\n\nOpposition lawmakers shouted “Resign!” as she spoke in the House of Commons. But Truss said she would not.\n\nLabour Party leader Keir Starmer accused the Conservatives of lacking “the basic patriotic duty to keep the British people out of their own pathetic squabbles.”\n\nHe said that amid a worsening a cost-of-living crisis, “Britain cannot afford the chaos of the Conservatives anymore. We need a general election now.”\n\n### TARGET EVENT:\nLiz Truss announced her resignation as Prime Minister on October 20.\n\n### OPTIONS:\nA. Liz Truss became UK Prime Minister on September 5.\nB.
